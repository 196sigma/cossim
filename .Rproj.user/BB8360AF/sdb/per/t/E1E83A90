As of 20 March 2018, these data are stored in and AWS S3 bucket \"s3://btcoal/notes\". Different programs are needed to a) download the 10-Ks, b) extract the footnotes, and c) clean the footnotes.\n\nTo compute cosine similarity between two sets of footnotes, first generate a list of files to compare. The list of files to compare is based on matching gvkey, sic2, and fiscal year. Specifically, firms that have different GVKEYs and the same SIC2 and the same fiscal year are a match. Use these criteria to generate a list of all pairs of documents between which to compute cossim. \n\nTo distribute computation on EC2:\n1.\tSplit this list into 20 equally-sized chunks. \n2.\tCreate 20 EC2 instances. \n3.\tSend all extracted footnotes files to all 20 EC2 instances. \n4.\tFeed in list of pairs to a python script that computes cossim. \n5.\tStore cossim values in a text file with file 1 name, file 2 name, and cossim.\n6. \tSend filed with cossim values and metadata to S3. (s3://btcoal/cossim as of 03/20/2018.)\n\n## FILE STRUCTURE\n/code\n- cossim.py\n    - depends:\n    - outputs:\n- cossim-ec2-driver.py\n    - depends:\n    - outputs:\n- get_filestocompare.py\n    - depends:\n    - outputs:\n- get-s3-cossim-data.py\n    - depends:\n    - outputs:\n\n/data\n- raw/\n  - extracted-10k-notes.txt\n- working/\n\t- filestocompare.txt\n\t- s3-cossim-files.txt\n\t- cossim-XXX where XXX is an EC2 instance IP address\n- results/\n\t- cossim.txt\n",
