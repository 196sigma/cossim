S"Significant Accounting PoliciesConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company has one consolidated subsidiary with income attributable to a noncontrolling interest. The net income and comprehensive income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is insignificant. The Company's investments in entities it does not control but over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method and are included in Other Assets. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.Foreign Currency Translation and TransactionsThe functional currency for significant subsidiaries operating outside the United States is their respective local currency. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss within the Consolidated Statement of Equity and Comprehensive Income.Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses due to the remeasurement of account balances in foreign currencies are included within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and were not material to the Company's results of operations for2011,2010and2009.Revenue RecognitionThe Company enters into sales arrangements that may provide for multiple deliverables to a customer. The Company identifies all goods and/or services that are to be delivered separately under a sales arrangement and allocates revenue to each deliverable based on relative fair values. Fair values are generally established based on the prices charged when sold separately by the Company. In general, revenues are separated between hardware, engineering services, maintenance services and installation services. The allocated revenue for each deliverable is then recognized using appropriate revenue recognition methods.Sales related to long-term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting in accordance with the Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts subtopic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification. The percentage-of-completion method is predominately used in the Government Systems segment and sales and earnings under qualifying contracts are recorded either as products are shipped under the units-of-delivery method (for production effort), or based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract under the cost-to-cost method (for development effort). Purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item. Sales and costs related to profitable purchase options are included in estimates only when the options are exercised whereas sales and costs related to unprofitable purchase options are included in estimates when exercise is determined to be probable. Sales related to change orders are included in estimates only if they can be reliably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable. Changes in estimates of profit or loss on contracts are included in earnings on a cumulative basis in the period the estimate is changed.Sales related to long-term separately priced product maintenance or warranty contracts are accounted for based on the terms of the underlying agreements. Certain contracts are fixed-price contracts with sales recognized ratably over the contractual life, while other contracts have a fixed hourly rate with sales recognized based on actual labor or flight hours incurred. The cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred.The Company recognizes sales for most other products or services when all of the following criteria are met: an agreement of sale exists, product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit and money market funds with original maturity dates of three months or less.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsAllowances are established in order to report receivables at net realizable value on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The determination of these allowances requires management of the Company to make estimates and judgments as to the collectability of customer account balances. These allowances are estimated for customers who are considered credit risks by reviewing the Company's collection experience with those customers as well as evaluating the customers' financial condition. The Company also considers both current and projected economic and market conditions. Special attention is given to accounts with invoices that are past due. Past due is defined as any invoice for which payment has not been received by the due date specified on the billing invoice. The uncollectible portion of receivables is charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection efforts have ceased. Recoveries of receivables previously charged-off are recorded when received.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using costs which approximate the first-in, first-out method, less related progress payments received. Inventoried costs include direct costs of manufacturing, certain engineering costs and allocable overhead costs. The Company regularly compares inventory quantities on hand on a part level basis to estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements as well as historical usage. Based on these comparisons, management establishes an excess and obsolete inventory reserve on an aggregate basis. Inventory valuation reserves were$93 millionand$98 millionatSeptember 30, 2011and2010, respectively.The Company defers certain pre-production engineering costs during the development phase of a program in connection with long-term supply arrangements that contain contractual guarantees for reimbursement from customers. Such customer guarantees generally take the form of a minimum order quantity with quantified reimbursement amounts if the minimum order quantity is not taken by the customer. These costs are deferred to the extent of the contractual guarantees and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, up to15years, using a units-of-delivery method. This amortization expense is included as a component of cost of sales, within customer-funded research and development expense. Amortization is based on the Company&#8217;s expectation of delivery rates on a program-by-program basis and begins when the Company starts recognizing revenue as the Company delivers equipment for the program. The estimated useful life is limited to the amount of time the Company is virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long-term supply arrangements with the Company&#8217;s customers. Pre-production engineering costs incurred pursuant to supply arrangements that do not contain customer guarantees for reimbursement are expensed as incurred.Progress PaymentsProgress payments relate to both receivables and inventories and represent cash collected from government-related contracts whereby the governments have a legal right of offset related to the receivable or legal title to the work-in-process inventory.PropertyProperty is stated at acquisition cost. Depreciation of property is generally provided using straight-line methods over the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements,15-40 years; machinery and equipment,6-15 years; information systems software and hardware,5-10 years; and furniture and fixtures,6-12 years. Depreciation methods and lives are reviewed periodically with any changes recorded on a prospective basis.Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized and replaced units are written off. Maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amounts, are charged to expense in the period incurred. The fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of property is recorded when there is a legal or contractual requirement to incur such costs and the costs are reasonably estimable. Upon the initial recognition of a contractual or legal liability for an asset retirement obligation, the Company capitalizes the asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the property by the same amount as the liability. This asset retirement cost is then depreciated over the estimated useful life of the underlying property. The Company did not have any significant asset retirement obligations atSeptember 30, 2011and2010.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill and intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions. Business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values, and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are allocated to the Company's reporting units based on the Company's integration plans and internal reporting structure. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but reviewed at least annually for impairment.Customer IncentivesRockwell Collins provides up-front sales incentives prior to delivering products or performing services to certain commercial customers in connection with sales contracts. Up-front sales incentives are recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and are amortized over the period the Company has received a contractually enforceable right related to the incentives, up to15years, using a units-of-delivery method. Amortization is based on the Company&#8217;s expectation of delivery rates on a program-by-program basis. Amortization begins when the Company starts recognizing revenue as the Company delivers equipment for the program. Up-front sales incentives consisting of cash payments or customer account credits are amortized as a reduction of sales, whereas incentives consisting of free products are amortized as cost of sales.Incentives earned by customers based on purchases of Company products or services are recognized as a liability when the related sale is recorded. Incentives consisting of cash payments or customer account credits are recognized as a reduction of sales while incentives consisting of free products and account credits where the customer's use is restricted to future purchases are recognized as cost of sales. The liability for these types of incentives is included in Other current liabilities.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when management plans to dispose of assets or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Assets held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Management determines fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques. Long-lived assets held for use are reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its remaining useful life. If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. See Note 24 for discussion of certain asset impairments recorded in 2011.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment with more frequent tests performed if indications of impairment exist. The Company's annual impairment testing date is in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Impairment for intangible assets with indefinite lives exists if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is potentially impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Management determines fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques. The Company's annual impairment testing performed in the second quarter of2011,2010and2009yielded no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.Advance Payments from CustomersAdvance payments from customers represent cash collected from customers in advance of revenue recognition.EnvironmentalLiabilities for environmental matters are recorded in the period in which it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. At environmental sites in which more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, the Company records a liability for its estimated allocable share of costs related to its involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites in which the Company is the only responsible party, the Company records a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation.Income TaxesCurrent tax liabilities and assets are based upon an estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current year for each of the jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax. As part of the determination of its tax liability, management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating tax positions taken by the Company in determining the income tax provision and establishes reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with the Income Taxes topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and their respective carrying amounts for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts for the purpose of minimizing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on business transactions and interest rates, respectively. The Company's policy is to execute such instruments with banks the Company believes to be creditworthy and not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes or to manage exposure for net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. These derivative financial instruments do not subject the Company to undue risk as gains and losses on these instruments generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions that are being hedged.All derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. For a derivative that has not been designated as an accounting hedge, the change in fair value is recognized immediately through earnings. For a derivative that has been designated as an accounting hedge of an existing asset or liability (a fair value hedge), the change in the fair value of both the derivative and underlying asset or liability is recognized immediately through earnings. For a derivative designated as an accounting hedge of an anticipated transaction (a cash flow hedge), the change in the fair value is recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in Accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent the derivative is effective in mitigating the exposure related to the anticipated transaction. The change in the fair value related to the ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is immediately recognized in earnings. The amount recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss is reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company does not exclude any amounts from the measure of effectiveness for both fair value and cash flow hedges.Use of EstimatesThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, long-term contracts, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, product warranty cost liabilities, customer incentives, retirement benefits, income taxes, environmental matters, pre-production engineering costs, recoverability of long-lived assets and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period they are determined.Concentration of RisksThe Company's products and services are concentrated within the aerospace and defense industries with customers consisting primarily of military and commercial aircraft manufacturers, commercial airlines and the U.S. and non-U.S. governments. As a result of this industry focus, the Company's current and future financial performance is largely dependent upon the overall economic conditions within these industries. In particular, the commercial aerospace market has been historically cyclical and subject to downturns during periods of weak economic conditions, which could be prompted by or exacerbated by political or other domestic or international events. The defense market may be affected by changes in budget appropriations, procurement policies, political developments both domestically and abroad and other factors. While management believes the Company's product offerings are well positioned to meet the needs of its customer base, any material deterioration in the economic and environmental factors that impact the aerospace and defense industries could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.In addition to the overall business risks associated with the Company's concentration within the aerospace and defense industries, the Company is also exposed to a concentration of collection risk on credit extended to commercial airlines and business jet aircraft manufacturers. AtSeptember 30, 2011, accounts receivable due from U.S. and international commercial airlines were approximately$16 millionand$40 million, respectively. AtSeptember 30, 2011, accounts receivable due from business jet aircraft manufacturers were approximately$104 million. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations on the financial condition of all of its customers and maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based on expected collectability. Although management believes its allowances are adequate, the Company is not able to predict with certainty the changes in the financial stability of its customers. Any material change in the financial status of any one or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.As ofSeptember 30, 2011, approximately10 percentof the Company's employees were represented by collective bargaining agreements, which are generally set to expire between May 2013 and September 2015.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsIn April 2010, the FASB issued guidance related to the milestone method of accounting for research or development arrangements in which a vendor satisfies its performance obligations over time and all or a portion of the arrangement consideration is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone. This guidance became effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2011 with no significant impact to the Company&#8217;s financial statements.In October 2009, the FASB issued a revised standard for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. Under the revised standard, hardware that contains software which is essential to the product's functionality is excluded from the scope of software revenue recognition standards. The revised accounting standard became effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2011 with no significant impact to the Company's financial statements.In September 2009, the FASB amended the guidance for allocating revenue to multiple deliverables in a contract. In accordance with the amendment, companies can allocate consideration in a multiple element arrangement in a manner that better reflects the transaction economics. When vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, companies will now be allowed to develop a best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. Additionally, use of the residual method has been eliminated. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2011 with no significant impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows as the Company generally allocates revenue to deliverables based on the prices charged when sold separately by the Company.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsIn September 2011, the FASB amended guidance related to the testing of goodwill for impairment. The revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2012 and does not expect a significant impact to the Company's financial statements.In June 2011, the FASB amended requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income (OCI), requiring presentation of comprehensive income in either a single, continuous statement of comprehensive income or on separate but consecutive statements, the statement of operations and the statement of OCI. The amendment is effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal year 2013 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not impact the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and will only impact the presentation of OCI on the financial statements.In May 2011, the FASB amended the guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure. The amended guidance clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. The amendment is effective for the Company in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, with early adoption prohibited. The adoption of this amendment is not expected to materially affect the Company's financial statements."

S'Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesFinancial Instruments and Price Risk ManagementInergy utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to (i) manage its exposure to commodity price risk, specifically, the related change in the fair value of inventories, as well as the variability of cash flows related to forecasted transactions; (ii) ensure adequate physical supply of commodity will be available; and (iii) manage its exposure to interest rate risk associated with fixed and variable rate borrowings. Inergy records all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded either through current earnings or as other comprehensive income, depending on the type of transaction.Inergy is party to certain commodity derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of selected inventory positions, and qualify as fair value hedges. Inergy is also periodically party to certain interest rate swap agreements designed to manage interest rate risk exposure.  Inergy\'s overall objective for entering into fair value hedges is to manage its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and changes in the fair market value of its inventories and fixed rate borrowings.  The commodity derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as price risk management assets or liabilities and the related change in fair value is recorded to earnings in the current period as cost of product sold.  The interest rate derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheets in other assets or liabilities and the related change in fair value is recorded to earnings in the current period as interest expense.Any ineffective portion of the fair value hedges is recognized as cost of product sold or interest expense in the current period.  Inergy recognized a$0.5 million,$1.8 millionand$0.4 millionnet gain in the years endedSeptember 30, 2012,2011and2010, respectively, related to the ineffective portion of its commodity fair value hedging instruments.  In addition, for the years endedSeptember 30, 2012and2011, Inergy recognizednogain, respectively, and for the year endedSeptember 30, 2010, Inergy recognized a net loss of$0.1 millionrelated to the portion of fair value hedging instruments that it excluded from its assessment of hedge effectiveness.  Inergy also enters into derivative financial instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, which hedge the exposure of variability in expected future cash flows predominantly attributable to forecasted purchases to supply fixed price sale contracts and variable interest payments.  These derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as price risk management assets or liabilities.  The effective portion of the gain or loss on these cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income in partner\'s capital and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedge transaction affects earnings.  In certain situations under the rules, the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized as cost of product sold in the current period.  Accumulated other comprehensive loss was$14.9 millionand$6.7 millionatSeptember 30, 2012and2011, respectively.  Included in accumulated other comprehensive loss atSeptember 30, 2012was a loss of$7.4 millionattributable to commodity instruments and a loss of$7.5 millionattributable to interest rate swaps.  Approximately$6.9 millionis expected to be reclassified to earnings from other comprehensive income over the next twelve months.Inergy\'s policy is to offset fair value amounts of derivative instruments and cash collateral paid or received with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement.The cash flow impact of derivative financial instruments is reflected as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.Revenue RecognitionSales of NGLs and salt are recognized at the time product is shipped or delivered to the customer depending on the sales terms.  Gas processing and fractionation fees are recognized upon delivery of the product.  Revenues from storage and transportation contracts are recognized during the period in which the storage and transportation services are provided.Expense ClassificationCost of product sold consists of tangible products sold, including NGLs and salt, as well as certain direct costs incurred in providing storage services.  Operating and administrative expenses consist of all expenses incurred by Inergy other than those described above in cost of product sold and depreciation and amortization.  Certain of Inergy\'s operating and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization are incurred in the distribution of the product sales and storage sale but are not included in cost of product sold.  These amounts were$196.7 million,$209.5 millionand$176.3 millionduring the years endedSeptember 30, 2012,2011and2010, respectively.Credit Risk and ConcentrationsInergy generally extends unsecured credit to its NGL customers in the United States and Canada.  In addition, Inergy collects margin payments from its customers to mitigate risk.   Inergy\'s natural gas storage customers are primarily investment grade.  Provisions for doubtful accounts receivable are based on specific identification and historical collection results and have generally been within management\'s expectations.  Account balances are charged off against the reserve when it is anticipated that the receivable will not be collected.  The balance is considered past due or delinquent based on contractual terms.Inergy enters into netting agreements with certain NGL customers to mitigate the Company\'s credit risk.  Realized gains and losses reflected in the Company\'s receivables and payables are reflected as a net balance to the extent a netting agreement is in place and the Company intends to settle on a net basis.  Unrealized gains and losses reflected in the Company\'s assets and liabilities from price risk management activities are reflected on a net basis to the extent a netting agreement is in place.Twosuppliers, PBF Holding Corp. (22%) and BP Amoco Corp. (10%), accounted for32%of propane purchases during the past fiscal year.  No other single supplier accounted for more than 10% of propane purchases in the current year.Nosingle customer represented 10% or more of consolidated revenues.  In addition, nearly all of Inergy\'s revenues are derived from sources within the United States, and all of its long-lived assets are located in the United States.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.InventoriesInventories for NGL marketing, supply and logistics operations, which mainly consist of propane gas and other liquids, are stated at the lower of cost or market and are computed using the average cost method.  These inventories are designated under a fair value hedge program and are consequently marked to market.  Propane and other liquids inventories being hedged and carried at market value atSeptember 30, 2012and2011, amount to$73.2 millionand$147.7 million, respectively.  Inventories for storage and transportation operations are stated at the lower of cost or market and are computed predominantly using the average cost method.Shipping and Handling CostsShipping and handling costs are recorded as part of cost of product sold at the time product is shipped or delivered to the customer except as discussed in &#8220;Expense Classification.&#8221;Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.  Inergy capitalizes all construction-related direct labor and material costs as well as the cost of funds used during construction.  Amounts capitalized for cost of funds used during construction amounted to$14.8 million,$16.2 millionand$6.4 millionfor the years endedSeptember 30, 2012,2011and2010, respectively.  Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:Salt deposits are depleted on a unit of production method.Inergy reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If such events or changes in circumstances are present, a loss is recognized if the carrying value of the asset is in excess of the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.  Inergy has not identified any long-lived assets in which the carrying amount exceeded the fair value atSeptember 30, 2012.Identifiable Intangible AssetsThe Company has recorded certain identifiable intangible assets, including customer accounts, covenants not to compete and deferred financing costs.  Customer accounts and covenants not to compete have arisen from acquisitions.  Deferred financing costs represent financing costs incurred in obtaining financing and are being amortized over the term of the related debt.  Additionally, an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, regardless of the acquirer\'s intent to do so.Certain intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives, as follows:Estimated amortization, including amortization of deferred financing costs reported as interest expense, for the next five years ending September 30, is as follows (in millions):GoodwillGoodwill is recognized for various acquisitions as the excess of the cost of the acquisitions over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test.In connection with the goodwill impairment evaluation, the Company identifiedfivereporting units. The carrying value of each reporting unit is determined by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the date of the evaluation on a specific identification basis. To the extent a reporting unit&#8217;s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill may be impaired and the second step of the impairment test must be performed. In the second step, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value to all of its assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities to its carrying amount.Inergy has completed the impairment test for each of its reporting units and determined that no impairment existed as ofSeptember 30, 2012.Income TaxesInergy is a publicly-traded master limited partnership. Partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax, although publicly-traded partnerships are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to federal income tax, unless the partnership generates at least90%of its gross income from qualifying sources. If the qualifying income requirement is satisfied, the publicly-traded partnership will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Inergy Sales and Service, Inc. (&#8220;Services&#8221;), a subsidiary of Inergy, does not generate at least 90% of its gross income from qualifying sources, and as such, federal and state income taxes are provided on the taxable income of Services. The earnings of the Company and its limited liability subsidiaries are included in the Federal and state income tax returns of the individual members or partners. However, legislation in certain states allows for taxation of partnerships, and as such, certain state taxes for Inergy have been included in the accompanying financial statements as income taxes due to the nature of the tax in those particular states. In addition, Federal and state income taxes are provided on the earnings of the subsidiaries incorporated as taxable entities (IPCHA and Services). The Company is required to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using expected rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse.Net earnings for financial statement purposes may differ significantly from taxable income reportable to unitholders as a result of differences between the tax basis and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and the taxable income allocation requirements under the partnership agreement.Sales TaxInergy accounts for the collection and remittance of all taxes on a net tax basis. As a result, these amounts are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.Cash and Cash EquivalentsInergy defines cash equivalents as all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.Computer Software CostsInergy includes costs associated with the acquisition of computer software in property, plant and equipment. Inergy amortizes computer software costs on a straight-line basis over expected periods of benefit, which generally arefiveyears.Fair ValueCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts) and payables are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to their liquid and short-term nature.  As ofSeptember 30, 2012, the estimated fair value of the Company\'s fixed-rate Senior Notes, based on available trading information, totaled$11.6 millioncompared with the aggregate principal amount at maturity of$11.5 million.  The fair value of debt was determined based on market quotes from Bloomberg.  This is considered a level 1 pricing source within the fair value hierarchy.  AtSeptember 30, 2012, the Company\'s credit agreement (&#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) consists of a$550 millionrevolving loan facility (&#8220;Revolving Loan Facility&#8221;).  The carrying value atSeptember 30, 2012, of amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement of$311.7 millionapproximate fair value due primarily to the floating interest rate associated with the Credit Agreement.  AtSeptember 30, 2012, Inergy Midstream\'s$600 millionrevolving credit facility (&#8220;NRGM Credit Facility&#8221;) had amounts outstanding of$416.5 million, which approximated fair value due primarily to the floating interest rate associated with borrowings under the NRGM Credit Facility.  See Note 8 for a discussion of the Company\'s debt.Assets and liabilities from price risk management are carried at fair value as discussed in Note 7.  AtSeptember 30, 2012, the estimated fair value of assets, on a net basis, from price risk management activities amounted to$37.5 millionand liabilities, on a net basis, from price risk management amounted to$20.9 million.Comprehensive Income (Loss) Comprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income, which is solely comprised of unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments.  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the following (in millions):Inergy records the effective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on its derivative financial instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges as other comprehensive income.Income Per UnitInergy calculates basic net income per limited partner unit by utilizing the two class method. Basic net income applicable to partners&#8217; common interest is modified for the disproportionate ownership of Class B and certain restricted units in the undistributed earnings relative to their ownership of distributed earnings. This impact resulted in an decrease to basic net income per limited partner unit of$0.05for the year ended September 30, 2012. Diluted net income per limited partner unit is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of units outstanding and the effect of dilutive units granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Class B units. Diluted net income per limited partner unit is not adjusted for the above described difference in Class B and certain restricted units&#8217; share of undistributed and distributed earnings as the calculation assumes full conversion of the Class B and certain restricted units, which results in the most dilutive earnings per unit.Asset Retirement ObligationsAn asset retirement obligation (ARO) is an estimated liability for the cost to retire a tangible asset.  The fair value of certain AROs could not be made as settlement dates (or range of dates) associated with these assets were not estimable.Accounting for Unit-Based CompensationInergy sponsors a Long Term Incentive Plan and all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values.The amount of compensation expense recorded by the Company during the years endedSeptember 30, 2012,2011and2010, was$17.9 million,$5.8 millionand$10.9 million, respectively.Segment InformationThere are certain accounting requirements that establish standards for reporting information about operating segments, as well as related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. Further, they define operating segments as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. In determining its reportable segments, Inergy examined the way it organizes its business internally for making operating decisions and assessing business performance. See Note 14 for disclosures related to Inergy&#8217;s NGL marketing, supply and logistics, and storage and transportation segments.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, &#8220;Presentation of Comprehensive Income&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2011-05&#8221;). Under ASU 2011-05, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Under both options, an entity will be required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. Furthermore, regardless of the presentation methodology elected, the entity will be required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income. In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-12, "Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05" ("ASU 2011-12") which deferred this requirement in order to allow the FASB more time to determine whether reclassification adjustments should be required to be presented on the face of the financial statements. The amendments contained in ASUs 2011-05 and 2011-12 do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The amendments also do not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented. The Company adopted ASUs 2011-05 and 2011-12 in the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2012.  The Company elected to present the total of comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements.In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS" ("ASU 2011-04"). The amended guidance does not modify the requirements for when fair value measurements apply, rather it generally represents clarifications on how to measure and disclose fair value under ASC Topic 820 (Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures). Respective disclosure requirements are essentially the same. However, some of the specific amendments address the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and expand certain other disclosure requirements, particularly pertaining to level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 is intended to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The Company adopted ASU 2011-04 in the first quarter of the year ended September 30, 2012. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company\'s consolidated financial statements.In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06, "Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements" ("ASU 2010-06"), which is included in the ASC Topic 820 (Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures).  ASU 2010-06 requires new disclosures on the amount and reason for transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements.  ASU 2010-06 also requires disclosure of activities, including purchases, sales, issuances and settlements within the level 3 fair value measurements and clarifies existing disclosure requirements on levels of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques.  The Company has previously adopted the new disclosures for transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2.  The new disclosures for level 3 were adopted on October 1, 2011, as disclosed in Note 7.'

S"NOTE 1 &#150; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT\rACCOUNTING POLICIES HISTORY ROKWADER, INC. (the Company), was organized\runder the laws of the State of Delaware on March 18, 2005 as a vehicle to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants,\racquire a target company or business that primarily desires to seek the perceived advantages of a publicly-held corporation. On\rApril 23, 2007, Rokwader completed an acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Latigo Shore Music, Inc.\r(&#147;Latigo&#148;). Substantially all of the business conducted by Rokwader is through Latigo, its wholly-owned subsidiary.\rIn May and June 2015, the Company underwent a change of control when it sold an aggregate of 15,250,000 shares of its common stock,\rtogether with a warrant to purchase an additional 5,900,000 shares of its common stock to Coco Partners, LLC. As a result of this\rtransaction and the change of control of the Company, our business strategies and plan of operations have evolved into two segments:\r(i) the continuation of the Latigo music publishing business; and (ii) the investment and acquisition vehicle through Coco Partners. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements\rinclude the accounts of Rokwader, Inc. and subsidiary. Inter-Company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. INCOME TAXES The Company follows the guidance of\rthe Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 related to Income Taxes. According\rto Topic 740, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between\rthe tax basis of the assets and liabilities and their financial amounts at year-end. For federal income tax purposes, substantially\rall expenses incurred prior to the commencement of operations must be deferred and then they may be written off over a 180-month\rperiod. Tax deductible losses can be carried forward for 20 years until utilized for federal tax purposes. The Company will provide\ra valuation allowance in the full amount of the deferred tax assets since there is no assurance of future taxable income. Additionally,\rthe Company may reserve a portion of the deferred tax assets due to restrictions of tax benefits related to changes in ownership. The Company utilizes the Financial Accounting\rStandards Board&#146;s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 related to Income Taxes to account for the uncertainty in income\rtaxes. Topic 740 for Income Taxes clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing rules for recognition,\rmeasurement and classification in financial statements of tax positions taken or expected to be in a tax return. Further, it prescribes\ra two-step process for the financial statement measurement and recognition of a tax position. The first step involves the determination\rof whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50 percent likelihood) that a tax position will be sustained upon examination,\rbased on the technical merits of the position. The second step requires that any tax position that meets the more likely than not\rrecognition threshold be measured and recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is a greater\rthan 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This topic also provides guidance on the accounting for\rrelated interest and penalties, financial statement classification and disclosure. The Company&#146;s policy is that any interest\ror penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense when incurred. The Company has no uncertain\rtax positions or related interest or penalties requiring accrual at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily\rof cash in banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Company maintains all cash in deposit\raccounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced a loss in such accounts. As of December 31, 2015, the Company\rhad bank balances of $5,165,219 in two banks. The Company holds more than $250,000 in interest bearing accounts at one bank, thus\rthere is a credit risk related to these cash deposits as of December 31, 2015 of $4,849,763 since these amounts exceed the current\rfederally insured amount of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.   EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE Basic earnings per common share are\rcomputed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share consists\rof the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effects of options and warrants calculated using\rthe treasury stock method. In loss periods, dilutive common equivalent shares are excluded as the effect would be anti-dilutive. USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION\rOF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The preparation of financial statements\rin conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\rreported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\rand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates\rand assumptions. LONG-LIVED ASSETS The realizability of long-lived assets\ris evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount. Long-lived assets\rthat will no longer be used in our business are written-off in the period identified since they are no longer expected to generate\rany positive cash flows for us. Long-lived assets that continue to be used by us are periodically evaluated for recoverability.\rSuch evaluation is based on various analyses, including cash flow and profitability projections. The analyses necessarily involve\rsignificant management judgment. In the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value of the assets,\rthe carrying value of the assets is written down to its estimated fair value. No impairment loss on intangible assets\rwas recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. REVENUE RECOGNITION As required by FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue\rRecognition (&#147;ASC 605&#148;), the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery\rhas occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.Revenues are earned from the receipt of royalties relating to the licensing of rights in musical compositions. The receipt of royalties\rprincipally relates to amounts earned from the public performance of copyrighted material, the mechanical reproduction of copyrighted\rmaterial on recorded media including digital formats, and the use of copyrighted material in synchronization with visual images.\rConsistent with industry practice, music publishing royalties generally are recognized as revenue when cash is received. Revenue\rgenerally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at\rcost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are as\rfollows: Equipment 2-10 yearsFurniture 2-10 years Expenditures for repairs and maintenance\rare charged to expense as incurred. The costs of major renewals and betterments are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated\rdepreciation of property and equipment are removed from the accounts upon retirement or other disposition and any resulting gain\ror loss is reflected in operations of the period.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU\r2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities\rand assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to\rall entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and\rassets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this\rUpdate. The amendments in this Update will align the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities with International\rFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, requires deferred tax assets and liabilities\rto be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. For public entities, the amendments in ASU 2015-17\rwill be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within\rthose annual periods. For all other entities, thee amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for\rannual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.\rEarlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments\rin this Update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods\rpresented. If an entity applies the guidance prospectively, the entity should disclose in the first interim and first annual period\rof change, the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and a statement that prior periods were not retrospectively\radjusted. If an entity applies the guidance retrospectively, the entity should disclose in the first interim and first annual period\rof change the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and quantitative information about the effects of the\raccounting change on prior periods. The Company is currently assessing this guidance for future implementation. In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU\r2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. ASU 2015-02 change the analysis that a reporting entity\rmust perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The amendments in this Update affect the\rfollowing areas: (1) Limited partnerships and similar legal entities, (2) Evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or a service\rprovider as a variable interest, (3) The effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination, (4) The effect of\rrelated parties on the primary beneficiary determination, and (5) Certain investment funds. The amendments in this Update are effective\rfor public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,\r2015. For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and\rfor interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an\rinterim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning\rof the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this Update using a modified\rretrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.\rA reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. The Company is currently assessing this guidance for future implementation. In December 2014, the FASB issued ASU\r2014-18, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Identifiable Intangible Assets in a Business Combination. ASU 2014-18\relects the accounting alternative to recognize or otherwise consider the fair value of intangible assets as a result of any in-scope\rtransactions and states that they should no longer recognized separately from goodwill (1) customer-related intangible assets unless\rthey are capable of being sold or licensed independently from other assets of the business and (2) non-competition agreements.\rThe amendments in ASU 2014-18 will be effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and\rthe effective date of adoption will begin on the timing of that first in-scope transaction. The Company has not adopted ASU 2014-18\rduring the year ended December 31, 2014. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU\rNo. 2014-15, &#34;Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern &#34;. The amendments in this update provide guidance\rin U.S. GAAP about management's responsibilities to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue\ras a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The main provision of the amendments are for an entity's management,\rin connection with the preparation of financial statements, to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the\raggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date\rthat the financial statements are issued. Management's evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known\ror reasonably knowable at the date the financial statements are issued. When management identifies conditions or events that raise\rsubstantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, the entity should disclose information that enables\rusers of the financial statements to understand all of the following: (1) principal conditions or events that raised substantial\rdoubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern (before consideration of management's plans); (2) management's\revaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity's ability to meet its obligations; and (3)\rmanagement's plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern or management's\rplans that are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue\ras a going concern. The amendments in this update are effective for interim and annual reporting periods after December 15, 2016\rand early application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing this guidance for future implementation.  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, Development\rStage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. ASU 2014-10 eliminates the distinction of\ra development stage entity and certain related disclosure requirements, including the elimination of inception-to-date information\ron the statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity. The amendments in ASU 2014-10 will be effective prospectively\rfor annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those annual periods, however early\radoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2014-10 during the year ended December 31, 2014, thereby no longer presenting or\rdisclosing any information required by Topic 915. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU\rNo. 2014-09, &#34;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#34; (&#34;ASU 2014-09&#34;). ASU 2014-09 amends the\rguidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry specific requirements and converges areas under this topic\rwith those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract\rrevenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also\rrequires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts\rwith customers. Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the\rtime value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized\rbefore contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods\rbeginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is prohibited. Entities can transition to the standard either\rretrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We are currently assessing the impact the\radoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial statements and disclosures. EQUITY BASED PAYMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEES The Company applied the Financial Accounting\rStandards Board&#146;s Accounting Standards Codification Topic 505 related to Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees to account\rfor these options and warrants issued. According to Topic 505, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration\rreceived for the issuance of equity instruments shall be accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or\rthe fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The Company believes that fair value of\rthese options and warrants is a more reliable measure of the consideration received for services performed for the Company. We\rdetermined the fair value of these equity instruments using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Factors used in the determination\rof the fair value of these equity instruments include, the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the expected life\rof the equity instrument, the volatility of the underlying stock, the expected dividends on it, and the risk-free interest rate\rover the expected life of the equity instrument."

S'In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standard Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2014-09, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers,&#8221; which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 605, &#8220;Revenue Recognition,&#8221; as well as various other sections of the ASC, such as, but not limited to, ASC 340-20, &#8220;Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Capitalized Advertising Costs.&#8221; The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also includes a cohesive set of disclosure requirements that would result in an entity providing users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity&#8217;s contracts with customers.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and is to be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial adoption as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other appropriate components of equity or net assets on the balance sheet).  Early adoption is not permitted.  The Company is in the process of evaluating ASU 2014-09, including the choice of retrospective application upon adoption, and does not currently anticipate it will have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements.'

S'Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Peabody Energy Corporation (the Company) and its affiliates. Interests in subsidiaries controlled by the Company are consolidated with any outside shareholder interests reflected as noncontrolling interests, except when the Company has an undivided interests in an unincorporated joint venture. In those cases, the Company includes its proportionate share in the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the jointly controlled entities within each applicable line item of the consolidated financial statements.  All intercompany transactions, profits and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.Description of BusinessThe Company is engaged in the mining of thermal coal for sale primarily to electric utilities and metallurgical coal for sale to industrial customers. The Company&#8217;s mining operations are located in the United States (U.S.) and Australia, in addition to  equity-affiliate mining operations in Australia and Venezuela. The Company also markets and brokers coal from other coal producers, both as principal and agent, and trades coal and freight-related contracts through trading and business offices in China, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore, Indonesia, India and the U.S. The Company&#8217;s other energy-related commercial activities include participating in operations of a mine-mouth coal-fueled generating plant, the management of its coal reserve and real estate holdings and the development of Btu Conversion and clean coal technologies.Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet ImplementedIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance, which was further clarified in January 2013, requiring additional information intended to help reconcile existing differences in balance sheet offsetting requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). While this standard leaves existing guidance surrounding the offsetting of financial assets and liabilities unchanged, it requires several additional disclosures, including gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The guidance will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods (January 1, 2013 for the Company). While the adoption of this guidance will impact the Company\'s disclosures, it will not affect the Company\'s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.In June 2011, the FASB issued accounting guidance eliminating the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders&#8217; equity and instead requiring an entity to present the components of net income, the components of other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. That guidance also introduced new disclosure requirements, which were finalized in February 2013, requesting that entities provide additional information about reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income, including changes in accumulated other comprehensive income balances by component and significant reclassification items. The guidance became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 (January 1, 2012 for the Company), with the exception of the new disclosure requirements, which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012 (January 1, 2013 for the Company). The Company has reflected the new presentation of the components of net income and other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in two separate, consecutive statements in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income with no impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. While the adoption of the guidance surrounding the disclosure of items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income will impact the Company\'s disclosures, it will not affect the Company\'s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.In December 2010, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for business combinations that clarified a public entity&#8217;s disclosure requirements for pro forma presentation of revenue and earnings. If comparative statements are presented, the public entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The guidance also requires the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. The guidance was effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date was on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period that began on or after December 15, 2010 (January 1, 2011 for the Company). The guidance impacted the Company&#8217;s disclosures with no impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.In July 2010, the FASB issued accounting guidance to improve disclosures about the credit quality of an entity\'s financing receivables and the reserves held against them. End of reporting period disclosures became effective for reporting periods ended on or after December 15, 2010. Disclosures about activity that occurred during a reporting period became effective for interim and annual periods that began on or after December 15, 2010. While the guidance impacted the Company\'s disclosures related to credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses, the adoption of this guidance had no impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.In January 2010, the FASB issued accounting guidance that required new fair value disclosures, including disclosures about significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 categories of the fair value hierarchy and a description of the reasons for the transfers. In addition, the guidance required new disclosures regarding activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, including a gross basis reconciliation. The Company began complying with the new fair value disclosure requirements beginning January 1, 2010, except for the disclosure of activity within Level 3 fair value measurements, which became effective January 1, 2011. In May 2011, the FASB issued additional fair value measurement disclosure requirements intended to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. That update required fair value hierarchy categorization for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required, disclosure of all transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 categories and additional disclosures for Level 3 measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs. The guidance became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 (January 1, 2012 for the Company). While the adoption of this guidance impacted the Company\'s disclosures, it did not affect the Company\'s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.SalesThe Company&#8217;s revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Under the typical terms of the Company&#8217;s coal supply agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the transportation source(s) that serves each of the Company&#8217;s mines. The Company incurs certain &#8220;add-on&#8221; taxes and fees on coal sales. Reported coal sales include taxes and fees charged by various federal and state governmental bodies and the freight charged on destination customer contracts.Other RevenuesOther revenues include net revenues from coal trading activities as discussed in Note 8. "Coal Trading," as well as coal sales revenues that were derived from the Company&#8217;s mining operations and sold through the Company&#8217;s coal trading business. Also included are revenues from contract termination or restructuring payments, royalties related to coal lease agreements, sales agency commissions, farm income, property and facility rentals and generation development activities. Royalty income generally results from the lease or sublease of mineral rights to third parties, with payments based upon a percentage of the selling price or an amount per ton of coal produced.Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for SaleThe Company classifies items within discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements when the operations and cash flows of a particular component of the Company have been (or will be) eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company as a result of a disposal (by sale or otherwise) and the Company will no longer have any significant continuing involvement in the operation of that component. Refer to Note 4. "Discontinued Operations" for additional details related to discontinued operations and assets held for sale.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities ofthree months or less.InventoriesMaterials and supplies and coal inventory are valued at the lower of average cost or market. Raw coal represents coal stockpiles that may be sold in current condition or may be further processed prior to shipment to a customer. Coal inventory costs include labor, supplies, equipment (including depreciation thereto), operating overhead and other related costs.Investments in Marketable SecuritiesThe Company&#8217;s short-term investments in marketable securities, which are included in "Other current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets, are defined as those investments with original maturities of greater than three months and up to one year. Long-term investments, which are included in "Investments and other assets" in the consolidated balance sheets, are defined as those investments with original maturities greater than one year.The Company classifies its investments in debt securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation periodically. Such investments are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Investments in debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity and investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, generally reported in &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains and losses, determined on a specific identification method, are included in &#8220;Interest income&#8221; in the consolidated statements of operations.At each reporting date, the Company performs separate evaluations of its marketable securities to determine if any unrealized losses present are other than temporary. Such evaluations involve the consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to, the length of time the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer of the securities and whether the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities until recovery.  Refer to Note 3. "Asset Impairment and Mine Closure Costs" and Note 6. "Investments" for details regarding an other-than-temporary impairment loss of$35.5 millionrecognized during the year endedDecember 31, 2012related to the Company\'s marketable equity securities holdings.  There were no other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded during the years ended December 31,2011or2010.Property, Plant, Equipment and Mine DevelopmentProperty, plant, equipment and mine development are recorded at cost. Interest costs applicable to major asset additions are capitalized during the construction period. Capitalized interest in2012,2011and2010was immaterial.  Expenditures which extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating costs as incurred. Costs incurred to develop coal mines or to expand the capacity of operating mines are capitalized. Costs incurred to maintain current production capacity at a mine are charged to operating costs as incurred. Costs to acquire computer hardware and the development and/or purchase of software for internal use are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives.Coal reserves are recorded at cost, or at fair value in the case of nonmonetary exchanges of reserves or business acquisitions. The net book value of coal reserves, which excludes exploration properties, totaled$6.4 billionas ofDecember 31, 2012and$7.6 billionas ofDecember 31, 2011. These coal reserves include mineral rights for leased coal interests and advance royalties that had a net book value of$5.2 billionas ofDecember 31, 2012and$6.3 billionas ofDecember 31, 2011. The remaining net book value of coal reserves of$1.2 billionatDecember 31, 2012and$1.3 billionatDecember 31, 2011relates to coal reserves held by fee ownership. Amounts attributable to properties where the Company was not currently engaged in mining operations or leasing to third parties and, therefore, the coal reserves were not currently being depleted was$2.2 billionas ofDecember 31, 2012and$2.7 billionas ofDecember 31, 2011.Depletion of coal reserves and amortization of advance royalties is computed using the units-of-production method utilizing only proven and probable reserves (as adjusted for recoverability factors) in the depletion base. Mine development costs are principally amortized over the estimated lives of the mines using the straight-line method. Depreciation of plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the asset\'s estimated useful life or the life of the mine. The estimated useful lives by category of assets are as follows:Equity and Cost Method InvestmentsThe Company accounts for its investments in less than majority owned corporate joint ventures under either the equity or cost method. The Company applies the equity method to investments in joint ventures when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the joint venture. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost and any difference between the cost of the Company&#8217;s investment and the underlying equity in the net assets of the joint venture at the investment date is amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to the difference. The Company&#8217;s pro-rata share of the operating results of joint ventures and basis difference amortization is reported in the consolidated statements of operations in &#8220;Loss from equity affiliates.&#8221; Similarly, the Company\'s pro-rata share of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment of its equity method investments whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar is reported in the consolidated balances sheet as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)," with periodic changes thereto reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.The Company monitors its equity and cost method investments for indicators that a decrease in investment value has occurred that is other than temporary. Examples of such indicators include a sustained history of operating losses and adverse changes in earnings and cash flow outlook. In the absence of quoted market prices for an investment, discounted cash flow projections are used to assess fair value. If the fair value of an investment is determined to be below its carrying value and that loss in fair value is deemed other than temporary, an impairment loss is recognized. There werenoimpairment losses recorded during the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011or2010associated with the Company\'s equity method investments. Refer to Note 3. "Asset Impairment and Mine Closure Costs" for details regarding impairment charges recognized during the year endedDecember 31, 2012related to certain of the Company\'s cost method investments.Included in the Company&#8217;s equity method investments is its joint venture interest in the Middlemount Mine in Australia, which was acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of PEA-PCI (see Note 2. "Acquisition of Macarthur Coal Limited" for additional details). In addition to that equity interest, the Company also periodically makes loans to the Middlemount Mine joint venture pursuant to the related shareholders\' agreement, which is discussed further in Note 9. "Financing Receivables." The Company\'s other equity method investments include an interest in Carbones del Guasare S.A., which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Company fully impaired the carrying value of that investment in 2009.The table below summarizes the book value of the Company&#8217;s equity method investments, which is reported in &#8220;Investments and other assets&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheets, and the loss from its equity affiliates:The Company\'s equity interest in Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd reflected in the table above includes a remaining unamortized difference between the book value of that investment and the underlying equity in the net assets of the joint venture of$143.1 millionas ofDecember 31, 2012.In addition to impact of the loss from its equity method affiliates and changes to its pro-rata portion of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment of those affiliates, the book value of the Company\'s equity method investments was affected during the year ended December 31, 2012 by provisional fair value adjustments recorded during that period related to the purchase price allocation for the 2011 acquisition of PEA-PCI.Asset Retirement ObligationsThe Company&#8217;s asset retirement obligation (ARO) liabilities primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit.The Company estimates its ARO liabilities for final reclamation and mine closure based upon detailed engineering calculations of the amount and timing of the future cash spending for a third party to perform the required work. Spending estimates are escalated for inflation and then discounted at the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. The Company records an ARO asset associated with the discounted liability for final reclamation and mine closure. The obligation and corresponding asset are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred. The ARO asset is amortized on the units-of-production method over its expected life and the ARO liability is accreted to the projected spending date. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs or changes in timing of the performance of reclamation activities), the revisions to the obligation and asset are recognized at the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. The Company also recognizes an obligation for contemporaneous reclamation liabilities incurred as a result of surface mining. Contemporaneous reclamation consists primarily of grading, topsoil replacement and re-vegetation of backfilled pit areas.Contingent LiabilitiesAccruals for other environmental and litigation matters are recorded in operating expenses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accrued contingent liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. In general, costs related to environmental remediation and litigation are charged to expense. The current portion of these accruals is included in &#8220;Accounts payables and accrued expenses&#8221; and the long-term portion is included in &#8220;Other noncurrent liabilities&#8221; in the consolidated balance sheets.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for using a balance sheet approach. The Company accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the reporting date of the balance sheet to differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the related tax benefits will not be realized. In determining the appropriate valuation allowance, the Company considers the projected realization of tax benefits based on expected levels of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and taxable income in carryback years.The Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has agreater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. To the extent the Company&#8217;s assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate will be recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense.Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance BenefitsThe Company accounts for postretirement benefits other than pensions by accruing the costs of benefits to be provided over the employees&#8217; period of active service. These costs are determined on an actuarial basis. The Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets reflect the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations of its postretirement benefit plans. See Note 15. "Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits" for information related to postretirement benefits.Pension PlansThe Company sponsors non-contributory defined benefit pension plans accounted for by accruing the cost to provide the benefits over the employees&#8217; period of active service. These costs are determined on an actuarial basis. The Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets reflect the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans. See Note 16. "Pension and Savings Plans" for information related to pension plans.DerivativesThe Company recognizes at fair value all contracts meeting the definition of a derivative as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, with the exception of certain coal trading contracts for which the Company has elected to apply a normal purchases and normal sales exception.Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity until the hedged transaction occurs (or until hedge ineffectiveness is determined), at which time gains or losses are reclassified to earnings. To the extent that the periodic changes in the fair value of a derivative exceeds the changes in the hedged item, the ineffective portion of the periodic non-cash changes are recorded in earnings in the period of the change. If the hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company prospectively recognizes the mark-to-market movements in earnings in the period of the change. The potential for hedge ineffectiveness is present in the design of the Company&#8217;s cash flow hedge relationships and is discussed in detail in Note 7. "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements" and Note 8. "Coal Trading." Gains or losses from derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are recognized immediately in earnings, along with the offsetting gain or loss related to the underlying hedged item.The Company&#8217;s asset and liability derivative positions are offset on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis if the contractual agreement provides for the net settlement of contracts with the counterparty in the event of default or termination of any one contract.Non-derivative contracts and derivative contracts for which the Company has elected to apply the normal purchases and normal sales exception are accounted for on an accrual basis.Business CombinationsThe Company accounts for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase method requires the Company to determine the fair value of all acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets and all assumed liabilities. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management\'s judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates and asset lives, among other items.Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Consolidated Financial StatementsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment as events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would indicate potential impairment to be present include, but are not limited to, a sustained history of operating or cash flow losses, an unfavorable change in earnings and cash flow outlook, prolonged adverse industry or economic trends and a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition. The Company generally does not view short-term declines in thermal and metallurgical coal prices in the markets in which it sells those products as a triggering event for conducting impairment tests because such markets have a history of price volatility. However, the Company generally does view a sustained trend of depressed coal market pricing (for example, over periods exceeding one year) as an indicator of potential impairment.Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The Company generally groups such assets at the mine level, or the mining complex level for mines that share infrastructure, with the exception of impairment evaluations triggered by mine closures. In those cases involving mine closures, the related assets are evaluated at the individual asset level for transferability to ongoing operating sites, remaining economic life for use in reclamation-related activities or for expected salvage.When indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets used in operations for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by those assets under various assumptions to their carrying amounts. If such undiscounted cash flows indicate that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, impairment losses are measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset group to its carrying amount. As quoted market prices are unavailable for the Company\'s individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of an expected present value technique based on the income approach. The estimated future cash flows and underlying assumptions used to assess recoverability and, if necessary, measure the fair value of the Company\'s long-lived assets are derived from those developed in connection with the Company\'s planning and budgeting process. The Company believes its assumptions to be consistent with those a market participant would use for valuation purposes. The most critical assumptions underlying the Company\'s projections include those surrounding future coal prices for unpriced coal, production costs (including costs for labor and commodity supplies), foreign currency exchange rates and a risk-adjusted, after-tax cost of capital, which generally constitute unobservable Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.Refer to Note 3. "Asset Impairment and Mine Closure Costs" for details regarding impairment charges recognized during the year endedDecember 31, 2012related to long-lived assets. There were no impairment losses recorded during the years ended December 31,2011or2010.Fair ValueFor assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements, the Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.Foreign CurrencyFunctional currency is determined by the primary economic environment in which an entity operates, which for the Company\'s foreign operations is generally the U.S. dollar because sales prices in international coal markets and the Company\'s sources of financing those operations is denominated in that currency. Accordingly, substantially all of the Company&#8217;s consolidated foreign subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates while non-monetary items are remeasured at historical rates. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at the average rates in effect during the year, except for those expenses related to balance sheet amounts that are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses from foreign currency remeasurement related to tax balances are included as a component of "Income tax provision" while all other remeasurement gains and losses are included in "Operating costs and expenses." The total impact of foreign currency remeasurement on the consolidated statements of operations was a gain of$4.8 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2012 and losses of$0.9 millionand$38.5 millionfor the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.The Middlemount Mine, in which the Company owns a50%equity interest, utilizes the Australian dollar as its functional currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of that equity investee are translated to U.S. dollars at the year-end exchange rate and income and expense accounts are translated at the average rate in effect during the year. The Company\'s pro-rata share of the translation gains and losses of the equity investee are recorded as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)." The total foreign currency translation gain recorded for the year ended December 31, 2012 was$19.1 million. No foreign currency translation gains or losses occurred in 2011 or 2010.Share-Based CompensationThe Company accounts for share-based compensation at the grant date fair value of awards and recognizes the related expense over the vesting period of the awards. See Note 18. "Share-Based Compensation" for information related to share-based compensation.Exploration and Drilling CostsExploration expenditures are charged to operating costs as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves.Advance Stripping CostsPre-production.At existing surface operations, additional pits may be added to increase production capacity in order to meet customer requirements. These expansions may require significant capital to purchase additional equipment, expand the workforce, build or improve existing haul roads and create the initial pre-production box cut to remove overburden (that is, advance stripping costs) for new pits at existing operations. If these pits operate in a separate and distinct area of the mine, the costs associated with initially uncovering coal (that is, advance stripping costs incurred for the initial box cuts) for production are capitalized and amortized over the life of the developed pit consistent with coal industry practices.Post-production.  Advance stripping costs related to post-production are expensed as incurred. Where new pits are routinely developed as part of a contiguous mining sequence, the Company expenses such costs as incurred. The development of a contiguous pit typically reflects the planned progression of an existing pit, thus maintaining production levels from the same mining area utilizing the same employee group and equipment.'

S"NOTE 3&#8212;SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of Consolidation and PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Circle Star and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, JHE Holdings, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (&#8220;JHE&#8221;), and Circle Star Operating Corp., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;CSOP&#8221;).   All material inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure and estimation of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The most significant of the estimates and assumptions that affect reported results are the estimates of the Company&#8217;s crude oil and natural gas reserves, which are used to compute depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of proved crude oil and natural gas properties. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been included in these consolidated financial statements.Crude Oil and Natural Gas PropertiesThe Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties whereby costs incurred to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves, to drill and equip development wells, and expenditures for enhanced recovery operations are capitalized. Geological and geophysical costs, seismic costs incurred for exploratory projects, lease rentals and costs associated with unsuccessful exploratory wells or projects are expensed as incurred. Costs of seismic studies that are utilized in development drilling within an area of proved reserves are capitalized as development costs. To the extent a seismic project covers areas of both developmental and exploratory drilling, those seismic costs are proportionately allocated between capitalized development costs and exploration expense. Maintenance, repairs and costs of injection are expensed as incurred, except that the costs of replacements or renewals that expand capacity or improve production are capitalized.Under the successful efforts method of accounting, the Company capitalizes exploratory drilling costs on the balance sheet pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves in economically producible quantities. The Company capitalizes costs associated with the acquisition or construction of support equipment and facilities with the drilling and development costs to which they relate. If proved reserves are found by an exploratory well, the associated capitalized costs become part of well equipment and facilities. However, if proved reserves are not found, the capitalized costs associated with the well are expensed, net of any salvage value.Cash and Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.  We continually monitor our positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which we invest.Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits.  We have not experienced any losses related to these balances.  From time to time, such amounts on deposit are in excess of federally insured limits at April 30, 2014 and April 30, 2013, respectively.Financial InstrumentsThe carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and long-term debt approximate fair value, as of April 30, 2014 and April 30, 2013 due to their short maturities.Revenue RecognitionCrude oil and natural gas sales result from interests owned by the Company in crude oil and natural gas properties. We recognize revenue for our production when the quantities are delivered to or collected by the respective purchaser and title transfers to the purchaser. Prices for such production are defined in sales contracts and are readily determinable based on certain publicly available indices. All transportation costs are included in lease operating expense. For natural gas sales the sale method is utilized in determining whether a sale has occurred.Accounts ReceivableThe Company derives revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil.  Revenues from production on properties in which the Company shares an economic interest with other owners are recognized on the basis of the Company's interest.  Revenues are reported on a gross basis for the amounts received before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs, which are reported as separate expenses.  Revenue is recorded and receivables are accrued using the sales method, which occurs in the month production is delivered to the purchaser, at which time ownership of the oil is transferred to the purchaser.  Payment is generally received between 30 and 90 days after the date of production.  Collection of the revenue may vary depending on the status of wells or the performance of the operator.  Estimates of the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the prices at which it was delivered are necessary at year end.  Management&#8217;s knowledge of the Company&#8217;s properties, their historical performance, the anticipated effect of weather conditions during the month of production, NYMEX and local spot market prices, and other factors are the basis for these estimates.  Variances between estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded when payment is received, or when better information is available.Concentration of Credit RiskThe Company is subject to credit risk resulting from the concentration of its crude oil and natural gas receivables with several significant purchasers. The Company operates exclusively within the United States of America. For the year ended April 30, 2014, 100% of oil and gas revenue was from non-operated properties where the Company has no direct contact with the actual purchaser.  On these properties, our portion of the product was marketed by the multiple companies who operate these wells. In the event of the bankruptcy of any one of these operators we could incur a significant decrease in annual revenue. During the year ended April 30, 2014, three operators, Woodbine Acquisition, CML Exploration and Chesapeake/EXCO accounted for 73%, 15% and 12% of our revenue sales respectively.  Production and Exploration CostsProduction costs, including compressor rental and repair, pumpers&#8217; salaries, saltwater disposal, ad valorem taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, expensed workovers and other operating expenses are expensed as incurred and included in lease operating expense on our consolidated statements of operations.  Exploration expenses include dry hole costs, delay rentals, and geological and geophysical costs.Other PropertyFurniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of five years. Gain or loss on retirement or sale or other disposition of assets is included in income in the period of disposition.Depreciation expense for other property and equipment was $nil and $6,596, for the years ended April 30, 2014 and April 30, 2013, respectively.Asset Retirement ObligationsThe Company accounts for its asset retirement obligations by recording the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which a legal obligation is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Subsequently, the capitalized asset retirement costs are charged to expense through the depreciation, depletion and amortization of crude oil and natural gas properties and the liability is accreted to the expected future abandonment cost ratably over the related asset&#8217;s life.Asset ImpairmentProved crude oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment on a field-by-field basis each quarter, or when events and circumstances indicate a possible decline in the recoverability of the carrying value of such field. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected in connection with the field are compared to the carrying amount of the field to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount of the field exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amount of the field is reduced to its estimated fair value. Due to the unavailability of relevant comparable market data, a discounted cash flow method is used to determine the fair value of proved properties. The discounted cash flow method utilizes the most recent third party reserve estimation report and estimates future cash flows based on management&#8217;s estimates of future crude oil and natural gas production, commodity prices based on commodity futures price strips, operating and development costs, and a risk-adjusted discount rate.Non-producing crude oil and natural gas properties primarily consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves. Individually significant non-producing properties, if any, are assessed for impairment on a property-by-property basis and, if the assessment indicates an impairment, a loss is recognized by providing a valuation allowance consistent with the level at which impairment was assessed. For individually insignificant non-producing properties, impairment losses are recognized by amortizing the portion of the properties&#8217; costs which management estimates will not be transferred to proved properties over the lives of the leases based on experience of successful drilling and the average holding period. The Company&#8217;s impairment assessments are affected by economic factors such as the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, anticipated drilling programs, remaining lease terms, and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management.Depreciation, Depletion and AmortizationDepreciation, depletion and amortization of capitalized drilling and development costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties, including related support equipment and facilities, are computed using the unit-of-production method on a field basis based on total estimated proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. Amortization of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using total estimated proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves are established based on estimates made by the Company&#8217;s internal geologists and engineers and external independent reserve engineers. Upon sale or retirement of properties, the cost and related accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized. Unit of production rates are revised whenever there is an indication of a need, but at least in conjunction with semi-annual reserve reports. Revisions are accounted for prospectively as changes in accounting estimates.Estimates of Proved Oil and Gas ReservesEstimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and SEC guidelines. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:Our proved reserve information included in this report was predominately based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers. Estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate.We based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on the un-weighted arithmetic average of the prior 12-month commodity prices as of the first day of each of the months constituting the period and costs on the date of the estimate. Future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than these prices and costs which would impact the estimated value of our reserves.The estimates of proved reserves materially impact depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense and our estimates of impairment. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which we record depreciation and depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields.Share-Based CompensationThe Company follows the fair value recognition provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 718,&#8220;Compensation   Stock Compensation.&#8221;   The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options and stock awards. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service periods. Awards that vest only upon achievement of performance criteria are recorded only when achievement of the performance criteria is considered probable. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model is highly complex and dependent on key estimates by management. The estimates with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock-based awards, the estimated volatility of our stock price, and the assessment of whether the achievement of performance criteria is probable.  The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted market price on the grant date.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10,&#8220;Accounting for Income Taxes,&#8221;which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.The Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740-10 related to Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open.  As of April 30, 2014, the tax years ended April 30, 2013 and April 30, 2012 are still subject to audit.(Loss) per Common ShareBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is calculated in the same manner, but also considers the impact to net loss and common shares for the potential dilution from stock options, stock warrants and any other outstanding convertible securities, or common stock equivalents.We have issued potentially dilutive instruments as summarized in the table below.  We did not include any of these instruments in our calculation of diluted loss per share during the period because to include them would be anti-dilutive due to our net loss during the periods.The following table summarizes the types of potentially dilutive securities outstanding as of April 30, 2014 and April 30, 2013:Advances from Working Interest PartnersIn January 2013, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary CSOP, entered into two Participation agreements, whereby the Company became the operator of two wells in Trego County, Kansas.  In March 2013, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary CSOP, received a letter of intent to enter into a Participation agreement, whereby the Company agreed to proceed with gathering seismic data, and eventually become the operator of future potential wells in Trego County, Kansas.  The letter of intent was superseded by the Participation agreement finalized on September 13, 2013.In February 2014, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary CSOP, entered into a Participation agreement, whereby the Company became the operator of another well in Trego County, Kansas.Advances from working interest partners recorded in CSOP as of April 30, 2014 consisted of cash calls received from the other working interest owner, net of costs incurred on the respective wells.  As of April 30, 2014, net advances amounted to $59,479.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.  This ASU requires the Company to disclose both net and gross information about assets and liabilities that have been offset, if any, and the related arrangements.  The disclosures under this new guidance are required to be provided retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.  The Company is required to implement this guidance effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and does not expect the adoption of ASU 2011-11 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Various other accounting pronouncements have been recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or were applicable to specific industries, and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Derivative InstrumentsThe Company may enter into financing arrangements that consist of freestanding derivative instruments or hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features. The Company accounts for these arrangements in accordance with ASC Topic 815,Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesas well as related interpretation of this standard. In accordance with this standard, derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and are measured at fair values with gains or losses recognized in earnings. Embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract are bifurcated and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings. The Company determines the fair value of derivative instruments and hybrid instruments based on available market data using appropriate valuation models, giving consideration to all of the rights and obligations of each instrument. We estimate fair values of derivative financial instruments using various techniques (and combinations thereof) that are considered to be consistent with the objective measuring fair values. In selecting the appropriate technique, we consider, among other factors, the nature of the instrument, the market risks that it embodies and the expected means of settlement. For certain complex derivative instruments, such as free-standing warrants and embedded conversion options, we generally use the Black-Scholes model, adjusted for the effect of dilution, because it embodies all of the requisite assumptions (including trading volatility, estimated terms, dilution and risk free interest rates) necessary to fair value these instruments. Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. In addition, option-based techniques (such as Black-Scholes model) are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the trading market price of our common stock. Since derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair values, our income (expense) going forward will reflect the volatility in these estimates and assumption changes. Under the terms of the accounting standard, increases in the trading price of the Company&#8217;s common stock and increases in fair value during a given financial quarter result in the application of non-cash derivative expense. Conversely, decreases in the trading price of the Company&#8217;s common stock and decreases in trading fair value during a given financial quarter result in the application of non-cash derivative income."

S"2.      Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesPrinciples of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alpha Pro Tech, Inc. and Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.Events that occurred after December 31, 2014 through the date that these financial statements were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) were considered in the preparation of these financial statements.Periods PresentedAll amounts have been rounded to the nearest thousand with the exception of the share data. The Company qualified as a smaller reporting company at the measurement date for determining such qualification during 2014. According to the disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies, the Company has included balance sheets as of the end of the two most recent years and statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the two most recent years. InvestmentsThe Company periodically invests a portion of its cash in excess of short-term operating needs in marketable debt and equity securities. These investments are classified as available-for-sale in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;US GAAP&#8221;). The Company does not have any investments in securities that are classified as held-to-maturity or trading. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values using quoted prices in active markets for identical securities, with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized in net income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Investments that the Company intends to hold for more than one year are classified as long-term investments in the accompanying balance sheets.    The Company had an investment in non-trading warrants to purchase common stock in a publicly traded entity. These warrants were derivatives that were carried at fair value in the accompanying balance sheets. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of the warrants are recognized in the accompanying statements of income in the period in which they occurred.Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoice amount and do not bear interest.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company&#8217;s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company&#8217;s existing accounts receivable; however, changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future.  The Company determines the allowance based upon historical write-off experience and known conditions about its customers&#8217; current ability to pay.  Account balances are charged against the allowance when management determines that the probability for collection is remote.InventoriesInventories include freight-in, materials, labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Allowances are recorded for slow-moving, obsolete or unusable inventories. The Company assesses inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable products and writes down the difference between the cost of the inventories and the estimated market values based upon assumptions about future sales and supplies on-hand.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the respective useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms as follows:Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized, whereas costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to operations in the period incurred.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe Company accounts for goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 350,Intangibles   Goodwill and Other. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested annually for impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives (see Note 6). The Company&#8217;s patents and trademarks are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 5-17 years.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe estimated fair values of financial instruments are determined based on relevant market information and cannot be determined with precision. The Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist primarily of cash, marketable securities and non-trading common stock warrants.The Company&#8217;s marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value based on quoted market prices.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in its business circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. If it is determined that the undiscounted future net cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of the assets, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying values over the fair values of the assets. The Company believes that the future undiscounted net cash flows to be received from its long-lived assets exceed the assets&#8217; carrying values and, accordingly, the Company has not recognized any impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.Revenue RecognitionSales are recognized when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) title transfers and the customer assumes the risk of loss; (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. These criteria are satisfied upon shipment of product.Sales are reduced for any anticipated sales returns, rebates and allowances based on historical data.Shipping and Handling CostsThe costs of shipping products to distributors are classified in cost of goods sold.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company maintains a stock option plan under which the Company may grant incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options to employees and non-employee directors. Stock options have been granted with exercise prices at or above the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of grant. Options vest and expire according to terms established at the grant date.The Company accounts for stock-based awards in accordance with ASC 718,Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires companies to record compensation expense for the value of all outstanding and unvested share-based awards, including employee stock options.For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were zero and 120,000 stock options granted, respectively, under the Company&#8217;s option plan. The Company recognized $33,000 and $150,000 in share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to issued options.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred income tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. The Company&#8217;s policy is to classify any interest and penalties assessed by the Internal Revenue Service as a component of the provision for income taxes. The Company presents taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing activities (i.e., sales tax) on a net basis in the accompanying statements of income. The Company provides allowances for uncertain income tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will not be sustained upon examination by the tax authority.The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the US federal jurisdiction, and in various states and foreign jurisdictions.  The Company is no longer subject to US federal, state or local income tax examination by tax authorities for years before 2011.  The Company is not currently under examination in any of the jurisdictions in which it operates.Earnings Per Common ShareThe following table provides a reconciliation of both net income and the number of shares used in the computations of &#8220;basic&#8221; earnings per common share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), which utilizes the weighted average number of common shares outstanding without regard to common stock equivalents, and &#8220;diluted&#8221; EPS, which includes all common stock equivalents which are dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.Translation of Foreign CurrenciesTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at each period end are translated at the exchange rate in effect at that date. Transaction gains or losses on foreign currencies are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.The Company does not have a material foreign currency exposure due to the fact that all purchase agreements with companies in Asia and Mexico are in US dollars. In addition, all sales transactions are in US dollars. The Company&#8217;s only foreign currency exposure is with its Canadian branch office. The foreign currency exposure is not material due to the fact that the Company does not manufacture in Canada. The exposure primarily relates to payroll expenses in the Company&#8217;s administrative branch office in Canada.Research and Development CostsResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Such costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.Advertising CostsThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and were $38,000 and $49,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.Fair Value MeasurementsFASB ASC 820,Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with US GAAP, clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. On a quarterly basis, the Company measures at fair value certain financial assets using a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own assumptions. The following fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels.This hierarchy requires the Company to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. The fair values of the Company's financial assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were determined using the following levels of inputs:&#8226; Level 1&#8212;Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;&#8226; Level 2&#8212;Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and&#8226; Level 3&#8212;Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.The fair values for the marketable securities, classified as Level 1, were obtained from quoted market prices. The fair value of the instrument in non-trading common stock warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The significant assumptions as of December 31, 2013 were as follows: risk-free rate of 0.13%, term 0.75 years, volatility of 48% and a dividend yield of 0.0%. The significant assumptions prior to the exercise of these warrants in March 2014 were as follows: risk-free rate of 0.13%, term .58 years, volatility of 50% and a dividend yield of 0.0%.New Accounting StandardsAccounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers(Topic 606) (&#8220;ASU 2014-09&#8221;) is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the first interim period within an annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 during the first quarter of 2017. Management is evaluating the provisions of this update and has not determined the impact its adoption will have on the Company&#8217;s financial position or results of operations.Management periodically reviews new accounting standards that are issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes merit further discussion."

S'1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESNature of operations and basis of presentation        We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on June 14, 1996. We are engaged in the discovery and development of novel, small-molecule drugs for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as muscle disorders.Financial statement preparation        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include those relating to the terms of our research and development collaborations (i.e. revenue recognition of upfront fees and certain contingent payments), investments, stock-based compensation, impairment issues, estimated useful life of assets, estimated accruals, particularly research and development accruals, and potential loss contingencies. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made, however actual results could differ from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial statements will be affected.Stock award plans        We have three stock option plans, our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (2011 Plan), 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (2000 Plan) and 2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (Directors\' Plan), that provide for granting to our officers, directors and all other employees and consultants options to purchase shares of our common stock. We also have our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan), where eligible employees can purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which considered our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and dividends. We estimate volatility over the expected term of the option using historical share price performance. For expected term, among other things, we take into consideration our historical data of options exercised, cancelled and expired. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rate. We have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. In order to calculate stock-based compensation expense, we also estimate the forfeiture rate using our historical experience with options that cancel before they vest. We review our forfeiture rates each quarter and make any necessary changes to our estimates. We use the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period for the entire award in recognizing stock-based compensation expense.Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities        We consider all highly liquid investments in debt securities with maturity from the date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds, U.S. treasury bills, corporate bonds and commercial paper and investments in government-sponsored enterprises. Our available-for-sale investments include obligations of government- sponsored enterprises and corporate bonds and commercial paper. By policy, we limit the concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit-quality issuers.        All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Unrealized gains (losses) are reported in the statements of stockholders\' equity and comprehensive income (loss). Fair value is estimated based on available market information or valuation methodologies. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. See Note 5 for a summary of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011.Fair value of financial instruments        The carrying values of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments. Cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value at December 31, 2012 and 2011.Concentration of credit risk        Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, U. S. treasury bills, government-sponsored enterprise securities, and corporate bonds and commercial paper. Due to the mostly short-term nature of these investments, we believe we do not have a material exposure to credit risk arising from our investments. All cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are maintained with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy.Property and equipment        Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.Revenue recognition        We present revenue from our collaboration arrangements under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 808,Collaboration Arrangements. Our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under FASB ASC 605-25,Multiple-Element Arrangements(as amended by Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13), and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has standalone value to the customer, whether the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered element and whether delivery or performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially under our control. The consideration we receive under collaboration arrangements is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the selling price hierarchy, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria is applied to each of the separate units. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned.        Revenues associated with substantive, at-risk milestones pursuant to collaborative agreements are recognized upon achievement of the milestones. We consider a milestone to be substantive at the inception of the arrangement if it is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, it relates solely to past performance and it is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. Non-refundable contingent future amounts receivable in connection with future events specified in collaboration agreements that are not considered milestones will be recognized as revenue when payments are earned from our collaborators through their completion or achievement of any underlying events, the amounts are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.Research and development expenses        Research and development expenses include costs for scientific personnel, supplies, equipment, consultants, research sponsored by us, allocated facility costs, costs related to pre-clinical and clinical trials, and stock-based compensation expense. All such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred.Research and development accruals        We have various contracts with third parties related to our research and development activities. Costs that are incurred but not billed to us as of the end of the period are accrued. We make estimates of the amounts incurred in each period based on the information available to us and our knowledge of the nature of the contractual activities generating such costs. Clinical trial contract expenses are accrued based on units of activity reported by third parties. Expenses related to other research and development contracts, such as research contracts, toxicology study contracts and manufacturing contracts are estimated to be incurred generally on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contracts. Raw materials and study materials purchased for us by third parties are expensed at the time of purchase.Contingencies        We are subject to claims related to the patent protection of certain of our technologies, as well as a purported securities class action lawsuit and other litigation. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue.Income Taxes        We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not.Net income (loss) per share        Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include warrant and stock options and shares issuable under our Purchase Plan. The dilutive effect of these potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of our common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.

ASU No. 2011-11 requires us to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of our financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on our financial position. In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01 which clarified that the scope of ASU No. 2011-11 only applies to derivatives accounted for in accordance with ASC 815,Derivatives and Hedging. ASU No. 2013-01 and ASU No. 2011-11 will be effective on or after January 1, 2013 and will be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We will adopt ASU No. 2013-01 and ASU No. 2011-11 on January 1, 2013 on a retrospective basis. We do not expect the adoption to have any effect on our financial position or results of operations.        In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05 for the presentation of comprehensive income thereby amending ASC 220,Comprehensive Income.ASU No. 2011-05 requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders\' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU No. 2011-05 is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and applied retrospectively. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 to defer the effective date of certain amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in ASU No. 2011-05 to allow the FASB time to redeliberate on the matter. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. ASU No. 2011-12 is effective at the same time as the amendments in ASU No. 2011-05. ASU No. 2013-02 will be effective beginning after December 15, 2012 and will be applied prospectively. We adopted ASU No. 2011-05 on January 1, 2012 and have presented separate statements of comprehensive income (loss). We will adopt ASU No. 2013-02 on January 1, 2013 on a prospective basis. We do not expect the adoption to have any effect on our financial position or results of operations.        In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04 thereby amending ASC 820,Fair Value Measurement, to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The amendments result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, and clarify the application of existing fair value measurements and requirements regarding the disclosure of information about fair value measurements. The amendments were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and applied prospectively. We adopted ASU No. 2011-04 on January 1, 2012 on a prospective basis. The adoption had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.'

S'NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESNature of OperationsUniversal Corporation, which together with its subsidiaries is referred to herein as &#8220;Universal&#8221; or the &#8220;Company,&#8221; is the leading global leaf tobacco supplier.  The Company conducts business in over30countries, primarily in major tobacco-producing regions of the world.ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Universal Corporation and all domestic and foreign subsidiaries in which the Company maintains a controlling financial interest.  Control is generally determined based on a voting interest of greater than 50%, such that Universal controls all significant corporate activities of the subsidiary.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.The equity method of accounting is used for investments in companies where Universal Corporation has a voting interest of 20% to 50%.  These investments are accounted for under the equity method because Universal exercises significant influence over those companies, but not control.  The Company received dividends totaling$5.2 millionin fiscal year2015,$6.5 millionin fiscal year2014, and$0.1 millionin fiscal year2013, from companies accounted for under the equity method. Investments where Universal has a voting interest of less than 20% are not significant and are accounted for under the cost method.  Under the cost method, the Company recognizes earnings upon its receipt of dividends to the extent they represent a distribution of retained earnings.The Company\'s49%ownership interest in Socotab L.L.C. (&#8220;Socotab&#8221;), a leading processor and leaf merchant of oriental tobaccos with operations located principally in Europe, is the primary investment accounted for under the equity method.  The investment in Socotab is an important part of the Company\'s overall product and service arrangements with its major customers.  As discussed further below, the Company reviews the carrying value of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates on a regular basis and considers whether any factors exist that might indicate an impairment in value that is other than temporary.  AtMarch 31, 2015, the Company determined that no such factors existed with respect to the investment in Socotab.  The Company, together with Socotab management, regularly evaluates the outlook for the business, and an impairment charge could be recorded in a future period if it is determined that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value and the decline in value is not temporary.In fiscal year 2006, the Company deconsolidated its operations in Zimbabwe under accounting requirements that apply under certain conditions to foreign subsidiaries that are subject to foreign exchange controls and other government restrictions.  Since that time, the investment has been accounted for using the cost method, as required under the accounting guidance.  The investment in the Zimbabwe operations waszeroatMarch 31, 2015and2014.  The Company has a net foreign currency translation loss associated with the Zimbabwe operations of approximately$7.2 million, which remains a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.  As a regular part of its reporting, the Company reviews the conditions that resulted in the deconsolidation of the Zimbabwe operations to confirm that such accounting treatment is still appropriate.  Dividends from the Zimbabwe operations are recorded in income in the period received.The Company holds less than a 100% financial interest in certain consolidated subsidiaries.  The net income and shareholders&#8217; equity attributable to the noncontrolling interests in these subsidiaries are reported on the face of the consolidated financial statements. During fiscal years2015,2014, and2013, there were no changes in the Company&#8217;s ownership percentage in any of these subsidiaries.Investments in Unconsolidated AffiliatesThe Company&#8217;s equity method investments and its cost method investments, which include its Zimbabwe operations, are non-marketable securities.  Universal reviews such investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an investment may not be recovered.  For example, the Company would review such an investment for impairment if the investee were to lose a significant customer, suffer a large reduction in sales margins, experience a major change in its business environment, or undergo any other significant change in its normal business.  In assessing the recoverability of equity or cost method investments, the Company follows the applicable accounting guidance in determining the fair value of the investments.  In most cases, this involves the use of discounted cash flow models (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy under the accounting guidance).  If the fair value of an equity or cost method investee is determined to be lower than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized.  The determination of fair value using discounted cash flow models is normally not based on observable market data from independent sources and therefore requires significant management judgment with respect to estimates of future operating earnings and the selection of an appropriate discount rate.  The use of different assumptions could increase or decrease estimated future operating cash flows, and the discounted value of those cash flows, and therefore could increase or decrease any impairment charge related to these investments.In its consolidated statements of income, the Company reports its proportional share of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates accounted for on the equity method based on the pretax earnings of those affiliates, as permitted under the applicable accounting guidance.  All applicable foreign and U.S. income taxes are provided on these earnings and reported as a component of consolidated income tax expense.  For unconsolidated affiliates located in foreign jurisdictions, repatriation of the Company&#8217;s share of the earnings through dividends is assumed in determining consolidated income tax expense.The following table provides a reconciliation of (1) equity in the pretax earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, as reported in the consolidated statements of income to (2) equity in the net income of unconsolidated affiliates, net of dividends, as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal years endedMarch 31, 2015,2014, and2013Earnings Per Share The Company calculates basic earnings per share based on earnings available to common shareholders after payment of dividends on the Company&#8217;s Series B 6.75% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock.  The calculation uses the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed in a similar manner using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding.  Dilutive potential common shares are outstanding dilutive stock options and stock appreciation rights that are assumed to be exercised, unvested restricted stock units and performance share awards that are assumed to be fully vested and paid out in shares of common stock, and shares of convertible perpetual preferred stock that are assumed to be converted when the effect is dilutive.  In periods when the effect of the convertible perpetual preferred stock is dilutive and these shares are assumed to be converted into common stock, dividends paid on the preferred stock are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.Calculations of earnings per share for the fiscal years endedMarch 31, 2015,2014, and2013, are provided in Note 4.Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.Advances to SuppliersIn many sourcing origins where the Company operates, it provides agronomy services and seasonal advances of seed, fertilizer, and other supplies to tobacco farmers for crop production, or makes seasonal cash advances to farmers for the procurement of those inputs.  These advances are short term, are repaid upon delivery of tobacco to the Company, and are reported in advances to suppliers in the consolidated balance sheets.  In several origins, the Company has made long-term advances to tobacco farmers to finance curing barns and other farm infrastructure.  In some years, due to low crop yields and other factors, individual farmers may not deliver sufficient volumes of tobacco to fully repay their seasonal advances, and the Company may extend repayment of those advances into future crop years.  The long-term portion of advances is included in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets.  Both the current and the long-term portions of advances to suppliers are reported net of allowances recorded when the Company determines that amounts outstanding are not likely to be collected. Short-term and long-term advances to suppliers totaled approximately$156 millionatMarch 31, 2015and$190 millionatMarch 31, 2014.  The related valuation allowances totaled$35 millionatMarch 31, 2015, and$46 millionatMarch 31, 2014, and were estimated based on the Company&#8217;s historical loss information and crop projections.  The allowances were increased by net provisions for estimated uncollectible amounts of approximately$3.7 millionin fiscal year2015,$5.5 millionin fiscal year2014, and$1.6 millionin fiscal year2013. These provisions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.   Interest on advances is recognized in earnings upon the farmers&#8217; delivery of tobacco in payment of principal and interest. Advances on which interest accrual had been discontinued totaled approximately$15 millionatMarch 31, 2015, and$23 millionatMarch 31, 2014.InventoriesTobacco inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Raw materials primarily consist of unprocessed leaf tobacco, which is clearly identified by type and grade at the time of purchase.  The Company tracks the costs associated with this tobacco in the final product lots, and maintains this identification through the time of sale.  This method of cost accounting is referred to as the specific cost or specific identification method.  The predominant cost component of the Company&#8217;s inventories is the cost of the unprocessed tobacco.  Direct and indirect processing costs related to these raw materials are capitalized and allocated to inventory in a systematic manner.  The Company does not capitalize any interest or sales-related costs in inventory.  Freight costs are recorded in cost of goods sold.  Other inventories consist primarily of seed, fertilizer, packing materials, and other supplies, and are valued principally at the lower of average cost or market.Recoverable Value-Added Tax CreditsIn many foreign countries, the Company&#8217;s local operating subsidiaries pay significant amounts of value-added tax (&#8220;VAT&#8221;) on purchases of unprocessed and processed tobacco, crop inputs, packing materials, and various other goods and services.  In some countries, VAT is a national tax, and in other countries it is assessed at the state level.  Items subject to VAT vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as do the rates at which the tax is assessed.  When tobacco is sold to customers in the country of origin, the operating subsidiaries generally collect VAT on those sales.  The subsidiaries are normally permitted to offset their VAT payments against the collections and remit only the incremental VAT collections to the tax authorities.  When tobacco is sold for export, VAT is normally not assessed.  In countries where tobacco sales are predominately for export markets, VAT collections generated on downstream sales are often not sufficient to fully offset the subsidiaries&#8217; VAT payments.  In those situations, unused VAT credits can accumulate.  Some jurisdictions have procedures that allow companies to apply for refunds of unused VAT credits from the tax authorities, but the refund process often takes an extended period of time and it is not uncommon for refund applications to be challenged or rejected in part on technical grounds.  Other jurisdictions may permit companies to sell or transfer unused VAT credits to third parties in private transactions, although approval for such transactions must normally be obtained from the tax authorities, limits on the amounts that can be transferred may be imposed, and the proceeds realized may be heavily discounted from the face value of the credits.  Due to these factors, local operating subsidiaries in some countries can accumulate significant balances of VAT credits over time.  The Company reviews these balances on a regular basis and records valuation allowances on the credits to reflect amounts that are not expected to be recovered, as well as discounts anticipated on credits that are expected to be sold or transferred.  AtMarch 31, 2015and2014, the aggregate balances of recoverable tax credits held by the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries totaled approximately$60 millionand$66 million, respectively, and the related valuation allowances totaled approximately$23 millionand$30 million, respectively. The net balances are reported in other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation of plant and equipment is based upon historical cost and the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation is calculated primarily using the straight-line method.  Buildings include tobacco processing and blending facilities, offices, and warehouses. Machinery and equipment consists of processing and packing machinery and transport, office, and computer equipment.  Estimated useful lives range as follows: buildings -15to40years; processing and packing machinery -3to11years; transport equipment -3to10years; and office and computer equipment -3to10years.  Where applicable and material in amount, the Company capitalizes related interest costs during periods that property, plant and equipment are being constructed or made ready for service.  No interest was capitalized in fiscal years2015,2014, or2013.Goodwill and Other IntangiblesGoodwill and other intangibles principally consist of the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the fair value of the net assets.  Goodwill is carried at the lower of cost or fair value.  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350 (&#8220;ASC 350&#8221;) permits companies to base their initial assessments of potential goodwill impairment on qualitative factors, and the Company elected to use that approach at March 31, 2015.  Those factors did not indicate any potential impairment of the Company\'s recorded goodwill.  Prior to fiscal year 2015, the Company followed the quantitative approach in ASC 350, which primarily involved the use of discounted cash flow models (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in the accounting guidance).  The calculations in these models were normally not based on observable market data from independent sources and therefore required significant management judgment with respect to estimates of future operating earnings and the selection of an appropriate discount rate.Reporting units are distinct operating subsidiaries or groups of subsidiaries that typically compose the Company&#8217;s business in a specific country or location.  Goodwill is allocated to reporting units based on the country or location to which a specific acquisition relates, or by allocation based on expected future cash flows if the acquisition relates to more than one country or location. The majority of the Company&#8217;s goodwill relates to its reporting unit in Brazil.  Significant adverse changes in the operations or estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit with recorded goodwill could result in an impairment charge.  No charges for goodwill impairment were recorded in fiscal years2015,2014, or2013.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets    The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in business conditions, or other circumstances provide an indication that such assets may be impaired.  Potential impairment is initially assessed by comparing management&#8217;s undiscounted estimates of future cash flows from the use or disposition of the assets to their carrying value.  If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value determined in accordance with the accounting guidance.  In many cases, this involves the use of discounted cash flow models that are not based on observable market data from independent sources (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy under the accounting guidance).  No significant charges for impairment of long-lived assets were recorded during fiscal years2015,2014, or2013.Income TaxesThe Company provides deferred income taxes on temporary differences between the book and tax basis of its assets and liabilities. Those differences arise principally from employee benefit accruals, depreciation, deferred compensation, undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, goodwill, and valuation allowances on farmer advances and value-added tax credits.Fair Values of Financial InstrumentsThe fair values of the Company&#8217;s long-term obligations, disclosed in Note 7, approximate their carrying amount since the variable interest rates in the underlying credit agreement reflect the market interest rates that were available to the Company at March 31, 2015.  In periods when fixed-rate obligations are outstanding, fair values are estimated using market prices where they are available and discounted cash flow models based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar classes of borrowers and borrowing arrangements. The fair values of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges and used to fix the variable benchmark rate on outstanding long-term obligations are determined separately and recorded in other long-term liabilities.  Except for interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency exchange contracts that are discussed below, the fair values of all other assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  Interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used from time to time to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.  The Company enters into such contracts only with counterparties of good standing.  The credit exposure related to non-performance by the counterparties and the Company is considered in determining the fair values of the derivatives, and the effect has not been material to the financial statements or operations of the Company.  Additional disclosures related to the Company&#8217;s derivatives and hedging activities are provided in Note 9.Translation and Remeasurement of Foreign CurrenciesThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries having the local currency as the functional currency are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at period end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates applicable to each reporting period for results of operations.  Adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements are reflected as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss.The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries having the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, with certain transactions denominated in a local currency, are remeasured into U.S. dollars.  The remeasurement of local currency amounts into U.S. dollars creates remeasurement gains and losses that are included in earnings as a component of selling, general, and administrative expense.  The Company recognized net remeasurement losses of$28.8 millionin fiscal year2015, net remeasurement losses of$14.3 millionin fiscal year2014, and net remeasurement gains of$10.6 millionin fiscal year2013.Foreign currency transactions and forward foreign currency exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges generate gains and losses when they are settled or when they are marked to market under the prescribed accounting guidance.  These transaction gains and losses are also included in earnings as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses.  The Company recognized net foreign currency transaction gains of$17.7 millionin fiscal year2015, net transaction losses of$6.0 millionin fiscal year2014, and net transaction losses of$1.0 millionin fiscal year2013.Revenue RecognitionRevenue from the sale of tobacco is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer and the earnings process is complete.  Substantially all sales revenue is recorded based on the physical transfer of products to customers.  A large percentage of the Company&#8217;s sales are to major multinational manufacturers of consumer tobacco products.  The Company works closely with those customers to understand and plan for their requirements for volumes, styles, and grades of leaf tobacco from its various growing regions, and extensive coordination is maintained on an ongoing basis to determine and satisfy their requirements for physical shipment of processed tobacco.  In most cases, customers request shipment within a relatively short period of time after the tobacco is processed and packed.  The customers also specify, in sales contracts and in shipping documents, the precise terms for transfer of title and risk of loss for the tobacco.  Customer returns and rejections are not significant, and the Company&#8217;s sales history indicates that customer-specific acceptance provisions are consistently met upon transfer of title and risk of loss.While most of the Company&#8217;s revenue consists of tobacco that is purchased from farmers, processed and packed in its factories, and then sold to customers, some revenue is earned from processing tobacco owned by customers.  These arrangements usually exist in specific markets where the customers contract directly with farmers for leaf production, and they have accounted for less than5%of total revenue on an annual basis through the fiscal year endedMarch 31, 2015.  Processing and packing of leaf tobacco is a short-duration process.  Under normal operating conditions, raw tobacco that is placed into the production line exits as processed and packed tobacco within one hour, and is then transported to customer-designated storage facilities.  The revenue for these services is recognized when processing is completed, and the Company&#8217;s operating history indicates that customer requirements for processed tobacco are consistently met upon completion of processing.Stock-Based CompensationShare-based payments, such as grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share awards, are measured at fair value and reported as expense in the financial statements over the requisite service period.  Additional disclosures related to stock-based compensation are included in Note 13.Estimates and AssumptionsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.Accounting PronouncementsEffective April 1, 2013, Universal adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update 2013-02, &#8220;Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income&#8221; ("ASU 2013-02"). The guidance in ASU 2013-02 requires companies to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the respective line items in net income unless the amounts are not reclassified in their entirety to net income. For amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, companies are required to cross-reference other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts. Since the guidance requires additional disclosures only, it did not have any impact on the Company\'s results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.  The required disclosures are provided in Note 16.In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2014-09&#8221;), which supersedes substantially all of the current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;).  ASU 2014-09 was developed under a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;IASB&#8221;) to improve and converge the existing revenue recognition accounting guidance in U.S. GAAP and International Accounting Standards.  Under ASU 2014-09, the central underlying principle is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers at an amount determined by the consideration a company expects to receive for those goods or services.  The guidance outlines a five-step process for determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized from those arrangements.  It is more principles-based than the existing guidance under U.S. GAAP, and therefore is expected to require more management judgment and involve more estimates than the current guidance.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including all interim periods within the year of adoption.  However, the FASB has recently proposed a one-year deferral of the effective date.  Companies are allowed to select between two transition methods:  (1) a full retrospective transition method with the application of the new guidance to each prior reporting period presented, or (2) a retrospective transition method that recognizes the cumulative effect on prior periods at the date of adoption together with additional footnote disclosures.  Assuming the proposed one-year deferral of the effective date is issued by the FASB as expected, Universal would expect to adopt ASU 2014-09 effective April 1, 2018, which is the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and has not made any decision on the method of adoption.ReclassificationsCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year&#8217;s presentation.'

S'The consolidated financial statements are prepared according to United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. Management believes the Company&#8217;s critical accounting policies and estimates are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in dollars. The Company&#8217;s financing activities are incurred in U.S. dollars. Although a portion of the Subsidiary\'s expenses is denominated in NewIsraeli Shekels("NIS") (mainly cost of personnel), a substantial portion of its expenses is denominated in dollars. Accordingly, the Company\'s management believes that the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company and its subsidiary operate is the dollar; thus, the dollar is the functional currency of the Company. Transactions and balances denominated in dollars are presented at their original amounts. Monetary accounts denominated in currencies other than the dollar are re-measured into dollars in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") 830, "Foreign Currency Matters". All transaction gains and losses of the re-measurement of monetary balance sheet items are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss as financial income or expenses, as appropriate.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its Subsidiary and LabStyle US. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible to cash with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition, to be cash equivalents.  Short-term bank deposits are restricted deposits with maturities of up to one year and are pledged in favor of the bank as a security for the Company\'s rent and credit payments. The short-term bank deposits are denominated in NIS and bear interest at an average rate of0.01% and0.42% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The short-term bank deposits are presented at their cost, including accrued interest.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost plus allocable indirect costs or net realized value. Cost is determined on a "moving average" basis. Inventory write-down is provided to cover technological obsolescence, excess inventories and discontinued products. Inventory write-down represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value. Inventory write-down is charged to the cost of revenues and ramp up of manufacturing when a new lower cost basis is established. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Work-in-process is immaterial, given the typically short manufacturing cycle, and therefore is disclosed in conjunction with raw materials. Total write-offs during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 amounted to $193and $1,046, respectively.  Long-term lease deposits include mainly long-term deposits for the Company\'s leased vehicles.  Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets at the following annual rates:     Revenues from product sales are recognized in accordance with ASC 605-10 &#8220;Revenue Recognition&#8221;, when delivery has occurred, persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, the vendor&#8217;s fee is fixed or determinable, no further obligation exists and collectability is probable. The Company derives revenues from the sale of its Dario&#153; Smart Meter and its related device-specific disposables test strip cartridges and lancets through independent distributors or directly to end users. The Dario&#153; software application is offered for a free download and the Company does not obtain a recurring hosting commitment towards the end users relating specifically to the application. The Company generally has a standard contract with its distributors. According to the agreements, all sales to distributors are final, no rights of return or price protection right is granted to such distributors and the Company is not a party of the agreements between distributors and their customers. Through the year ended December 31, 2015, product sales to distributors are recognized as revenues upon receipt of payment. The Company will apply this policy until it will have sufficient historical experience with each distributor in order to conclude that fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. The Company also generates revenues from arrangements with health care providers which include supply of Dario&#153; Smart Meters and software platform that requires certain customization followed by monthly service, support and maintenance. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as software and non-software components, the Company allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy as required according to ASC 605-25, &#8220;Multiple-Element Arrangements&#8221;. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (&#8220;VSOE&#8221;), if available, third party evidence (&#8220;TPE&#8221;) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (&#8220;ESP&#8221;) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The best estimate of selling price is established considering several internal factors including, but not limited to, historical sales, pricing practices and geographies in which the Company offers its products. The determination of ESP is judgmental. Revenues from software components in sales arrangement contains multiple elements are recognized when all criteria outlined in ASC 985-605, &#8220;Software Revenue Recognition&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 985-605&#8221;), are met. Revenue from services is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred or the services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. For multiple element arrangements within ASC 985-605, revenues are allocated to the different elements in the arrangement under the &#8220;residual method&#8221; when VSOE of fair value exist for all undelivered elements and no VSOE exists for the delivered elements. Under the residual method, at the outset of the arrangement with the customer, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue when the basic criteria in ASC 985-605 have been met. Any discount in the arrangement is allocated to the delivered element. Since VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements, revenues are recognized as one unit of accounting, on a straight-line basis over the term of the last deliverable based on ASC 605-15, &#8220;Products&#8221; and ASC 985-605. Deferred revenues include advances and payments received from customers, for which revenue has not yet been recognized.  Cost of revenues is comprised of the cost of production, shipping and handling inventory, personnel and related overhead costs, depreciation of production line and related equipment costs and inventory write-downs.  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits. All of the cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits of the Company and its Subsidiary are invested in deposits and current accounts with major U.S. and Israeli banks. Such cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits may be in excess of insured limits and are not insured in other jurisdictions. Generally, cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits may be redeemed and therefore a minimal credit risk exists with respect to these deposits and investments.  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes" ("ASC 740"). This guidance prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, a full valuation allowance was provided by the Company. ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring a liability for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as a result of the implementation of ASC 740.  Research and development costs are charged to the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, as incurred.  The Company classifies the Series A Preferred Stock (as defined in Note 9b) outside of Stockholders\' deficiency because certain features of the COI would require redemption of some or all of the Series A Preferred Stock upon events not solely within the control of the Company.  The Company accounts for certain warrants held by investors and the Company&#8217;s previous placement agent and its permitted designees which include priced-based anti-dilution protection or certain net settlement cash features and liquidated damages penalties as a liability according to the provisions of ASC 815-40, "Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\'s Own Equity" ("ASC 815"), which provides a new two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer\'s own stock and thus able to qualify to be a derivative financial instrument. The Company measures the warrants at fair value by using Binomial option-pricing model in each reporting period until they are exercised or expired, with changes in the fair values being recognized in the Company\'s statement of comprehensive loss as financial income or expense.  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, "Compensation - Stock Compensation" ("ASC 718"), which requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the Company\'s consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. The Company recognizes compensation expenses for the value of its awards granted based on the straight-line method over the requisite service period of each of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are the expected stock price volatility and the expected option term. Expected volatility was calculated based upon historical volatilities of similar entities in the related sector index until the Company\'s own volatility data will be reliable. The expected option term represents the period that the Company\'s stock options are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on the simplified method until sufficient historical exercise data will support using expected life assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield from U.S. treasury bonds with an equivalent term. The Company has historically not paid dividends and has no foreseeable plans to pay dividends. The Company applies ASC 505-50, "Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees" with respect to options and warrants issued to non-employees. Until the Company received a ticker symbol for its Common Stock and caused the Common Stock to be eligible for trading on April 9, 2013, The fair value of the shares of Common Stock underlying the options and warrants granted through such date, had been determined by the Company\'s management with assistance of an independent valuation firm by applying of market approach using recent third-party transactions in the equity of the Company.  The Company applies ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" (&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;). Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches. ASC 820 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent from the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company\'s assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the inputs as follows:  The availability of observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of investment, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment and the investments are categorized as Level 3. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits, other accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, trade payables and other accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity of such instruments. Warrants are classified within Level 3 because they are valued using valuation techniques. Some of the inputs to these models are unobservable in the market and are significant.  Basic net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during each year. Diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during each year, plus dilutive potential Common Stock considered outstanding during the year, in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share". The total weighted average number of shares related to the outstanding warrants and options excluded from the calculations of diluted net loss per share due to their anti-dilutive effect was18,479,898and8,243,762for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Since inception date, all of Ltd.\'s employees who are entitled to receive severance pay in accordance with the applicable law in Israel are included under section 14 of the Israeli Severance Compensation Law ("Section 14"). Under this section, they are entitled only to monthly deposits, at a rate of 8.33% of their monthly salary, made on their behalf with insurance companies. Payments in accordance with Section 14 release Ltd. from any future severance payments in respect of those employees. Deposits under Section 14 are not recorded as an asset in the Company\'s balance sheet  From time to time the Company is involved in claims and legal proceedings. The Company reviews the status of each matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss.  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2014-09"), which will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 ("ASU 2014-15"), "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern" (Subtopic 205-40): "Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern" ("ASU 2014-15"), which defines management&#8217;s responsibility to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures if there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory." Under this accounting guidance, inventory will be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value and other options that currently exist for market value will be eliminated. ASU No. 2015-11 defines net realizable value as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. No other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Income Taxes &#150; Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes&#8221; ("ASU 2015-17"). The purpose of the standard is to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes on a classified balance sheet.  Under current GAAP, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are separated into current and noncurrent amounts in the balance sheet.  The amendments in ASU 2015-17 require that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet.  ASU 2015-17 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Companies can adopt the guidance either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-17 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or presentation.'

S'Significant Accounting PoliciesPrinciples of Consolidation:The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company in which a controlling interest is maintained.  Investments in affiliated companies that the Company does not control, and the activities of which it is not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for using the equity method.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.Revenue Recognition:The Company recognizes revenue when title passes to the customer.  This occurs at the shipping point except for goods sold by certain foreign entities and certain exported goods, where title passes when the goods reach their destination.  Selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual arrangements.  Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs are included in cost of products sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income.The Company acquired the assets of Gears and Services inJuly 2011.  Gears and Services recognizes a portion of its revenues on the percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis.  In2012and2011, the Company recognized approximately$60 millionand$40 million, respectively, in net sales under the percentage-of-completion method.Cash Equivalents:The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which represents an estimate of the losses expected from the accounts receivable portfolio, to reduce accounts receivable to their net realizable value.  The allowance was based upon historical trends in collections and write-offs, management&#8217;s judgment of the probability of collecting accounts and management&#8217;s evaluation of business risk.  The Company extends credit to customers satisfying pre-defined credit criteria.  The Company believes it has limited concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of its customer base.Inventories:Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  The majority of domestic inventories are valued by LIFO method and the balance of the Company&#8217;s inventories is valued by the FIFO method.Investments:Short-term investments are investments with maturities between four months and one year and are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.  The Company held short-term investments as ofDecember 31, 2012and2011with a fair value and cost basis of$31.3 millionand$32.0 million, respectively, which were included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  In addition, the Company&#8217;s business in India held investments in mutual funds of$14.6 millionas ofDecember 31, 2011. These investments were classified as &#8220;available-for-sale&#8221; securities and were included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Unrealized gains and losses were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Realized gains and losses were included in other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Property, Plant and Equipment:Property, plant and equipment, net is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The provision for depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives are approximately30 yearsfor buildings,threetoten yearsfor computer software andthreeto20 yearsfor machinery and equipment.The impairment of long-lived assets is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or related group of assets may not be recoverable. If the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized at that time to reduce the asset to the lower of its fair value or its net book value.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:Intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line method over their legal or estimated useful lives, with useful lives ranging fromtwoto20 years.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment at least annually.  The Company performs its annual impairment test on October first after the annual forecasting process is completed.  Furthermore, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with accounting rules related to goodwill and other intangible assets.EffectiveOctober 1, 2011, the Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, &#8220;Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment,&#8221; which allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.  EffectiveOctober 1, 2012, the Company adopted the provisions of (ASU) No. 2012-02, &#8220;Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment,&#8221; which allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if indefinite-lived intangibles might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test.Product warranties:The Company provides limited warranties on certain of its products.  The Company accrues liabilities for warranties based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty claim experience in accordance with accounting rules relating to contingent liabilities.  The Company records and accounts for its warranty reserve based on specific claim incidents.  Should the Company become aware of a specific potential warranty claim for which liability is probable and reasonably estimable, a specific charge is recorded and accounted for accordingly.  Adjustments are made quarterly to the accruals as claim data and historical experience change.Income Taxes:The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC No. 740, &#8220;Income Taxes.&#8221;  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company recognizes valuation allowances against deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with ASC No. 740-10. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.Foreign Currency Translation:Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, other than those located in highly inflationary countries, are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date; income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The related translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and the translation of financial statements of subsidiaries in highly inflationary countries are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company realized foreign currency exchange losses of$6.9 millionand$1.4 millionin2012and2011, respectively, and foreign currency gains of$4.3 millionin2010.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits:The Company recognizes an overfunded status or underfunded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations) as either an asset or a liability for its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss represents the current year net unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be recognized in future periods as net periodic benefit cost.Stock-Based Compensation:The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the stock-based awards over their required vesting period.  Stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the opening market price of Timken common shares on the date of grant.  The fair value of stock options is determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which incorporates assumptions regarding the expected volatility, the expected option life, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield.  The fair value of stock-based awards that will settle in Timken common shares, other than stock options, is based on the opening market price of Timken common stock on the grant date.  The fair value of stock-based awards that will settle in cash are remeasured at each reporting period  until settlement of the awards.Earnings Per Share:Unvested restricted shares of common stock provide for the payment of nonforfeitable dividends. The Company considers these awards as participating securities. Earnings per share are computed using the two-class method. Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income less undistributed earnings allocated to unvested restricted stock by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income less undistributed earnings allocated to unvested restricted stock by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for the dilutive impact of outstanding share-based awards.Derivative Instruments:The Company recognizes all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company&#8217;s holdings of forward foreign currency exchange contracts qualify as derivatives pursuant to the criteria established in derivative accounting guidance, and the Company has designated certain of those derivatives as hedges.Recent Accounting Pronouncements:In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): "Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment."  The new guidance includes periodic testing of indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment. This allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if indefinite-lived intangibles might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test.  The effective date of the new guidance is for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, and early adoption is permitted.  Effective October 1, 2012, the Company adopted this accounting guidance. The adoption of the new accounting guidance related to indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing had no impact on the Company\'s results of operations and financial condition.Effective January 1, 2012, the Company adopted the two-statement approach for the presentation of other comprehensive income in accordance with ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): "Presentation of Comprehensive Income."  The two-statement approach allows for the components of net income and total net income to be presented in a financial statement, immediately followed by a financial statement presenting the components of other comprehensive income and a total for comprehensive income.  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as a result of adopting this new guidance.In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): "Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05."  The amendments are being made to allow the FASB time to redeliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented.  As the FASB is considering the presentation requirements, entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU No. 2011-05.The Company adopted ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs," effective January 1, 2012.  The new accounting requirements do not extend the use of fair value accounting; they only provide additional guidance on the application and disclosure of fair value accounting where its use is currently permitted.  The new accounting requirements also expand the disclosures about fair value measurement.Use of Estimates:The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed and updated regularly to reflect recent experience.Reclassifications:Certain amounts reported in the2011Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation. Such amounts include reclassifications of certain selling, general and administrative expenses allocated to segments, the reclassification of assets for the final valuation of the opening balance for2011acquisitions and the reclassification of amounts between non-current deferred taxes and income taxes payable.'

S"NOTE 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts\rof BioZone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned, its equity investment in BetaZone Laboratories,\rLLC, and 580 Garcia Ave, LLC, a Variable Interest Entity (&#147;VIE&#148;). The Company considered the terms of its interest in 580 Garcia\rand determined that it was a variable interest entity (VIE) in accordance with ACS 810-10-55, and that it should be consolidated\rwith the Company.  As of December 31, 2011, amounts relating to 580 Garcia included in the consolidated assets, which\rare shown in Property and Equipment, and consolidated liabilities, which are reported in long-term debt, total $758,894 and $2,582,818,\rrespectively. The Company rents the manufacturing facility located at 580 Garcia Avenue, Pittsburg CA from 580 Garcia, is the sole\rtenant and is a guarantor of the mortgage note issued by 580 Garcia to GECC, the lien holder on the property. The Company&#146;s\rmaximum exposure to loss, which is based on the Company&#146;s guarantee of the mortgage note of 580 Garcia owed to GECC,\ris $2,582,818, which equals the carrying amount of the liability as of December 31, 2012. Our significant unconsolidated subsidiary that is accounted\rfor using the equity method of accounting is our investment in Betazone Laboratories LLC. Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity\rwith Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\rthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial\rstatements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those\restimates. These estimates and assumptions include the collectability of accounts receivable and deferred taxes and related valuation\rallowances. Certain of our estimates, including evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, could be affected by external\rconditions, including those unique to our industry, and general economic conditions. It is possible that these external factors\rcould have an effect on our estimates that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates. We re-evaluate all of our accounting\restimates at least quarterly based on these conditions and record adjustments when necessary. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all short-term highly liquid investments with\ran original maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Revenue Recognition We follow the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission&#146;s\rStaff Accounting Bulletin (&#147;SAB&#148;) 104 for revenue recognition and Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;)\rTopic 605, &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148;. The Company operates as a contract manufacturer and produces finished goods according\rto customer specifications. The agreements with customers do not contain any rights of return other than for goods that fail to\rmeet the specifications provided by the customer. The Company has not experienced any significant returns from customers and accordingly,\rin management&#146;s opinion, no reserve for returns is provided. We record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement\rexists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the selling price to the customer is fixed or determinable\rand collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. Accounts Receivable and Allowance\rfor Doubtful Accounts Receivable We have a policy of reserving for uncollectible accounts\rbased on our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We extend credit to our\rcustomers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and other factors. We generally do not require collateral or other\rsecurity to support accounts receivable. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential\rbad debts if required.  We determine whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is required by evaluating specific accounts\rwhere information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations. In these cases, we use assumptions\rand judgment, based on the best available facts and circumstances, to record a specific allowance for those customers against amounts\rdue to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. These specific allowances are re-evaluated and adjusted as\radditional information is received. The amounts calculated are analyzed to determine the total amount of the allowance. We may\ralso record a general allowance as necessary.  Direct write-offs are taken in the period when we have exhausted our efforts\rto collect overdue and unpaid receivables or otherwise evaluate other circumstances that indicate that we should abandon such efforts. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined using\rthe weighted average cost method, and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price, in the ordinary\rcourse of business, less estimated costs to complete and dispose of the product. If the Company identifies excess, obsolete or unsalable items,\rits inventories are written down to their realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. During the\ryear ended December 31, 2012 we recorded a charge to cost of sales of $405,918 while in the prior year period we charged $1,439,616\rrelating to the write-down of inventory due to obsolescence.  Shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases\rand product shipments are recorded in cost of sales in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Fair Value Measurements We adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, &#147;Fair Value\rMeasurements and Disclosures&#148;, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework\rfor measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments,\rincluding cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost\rbasis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our\rshort and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations, which include\rcontractual interest rates taken together with other features such as concurrent issuances of warrants and/or embedded conversion\roptions, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would\rbe received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset\ror liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value\rhierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring\rfair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 &#151; quoted prices in active\rmarkets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2 &#151; quoted prices for similar\rassets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observableLevel 3 &#151; inputs that are unobservable\r(for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) The warrant liabilities issued in connection with our convertible\rdebt, classified as a level 3 liability, are the only financial liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis We measure derivative liabilities at fair value using the\rBlack-Scholes option pricing model with assumptions that include the fair value of the stock underlying the derivative instrument,\rthe exercise or conversion price of the derivative instrument, the risk free interest rate for a term comparable to the term of\rthe derivative instrument and the volatility rate and dividend yield for our common stock. For derivative instruments convertible\rinto or exercisable for shares of our preferred stock, we considered the price per share of $.50 paid by unrelated parties as the\rfair value of our common stock. For derivative instruments convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock, we considered\rthe results of a valuation performed by a third party specialist and other internal analyses performed by management to determine\rthe value of our stock at the commitment dates of applicable transactions. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield\rcurve in effect at the time of grant. The Company has not paid dividends to date and does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable\rfuture due to its substantial accumulated deficit. Accordingly, expected dividends yields are currently zero. Expected volatility\ris based principally on an analysis of historical volatilities of similarly situated companies in the marketplace for a number\rof periods that is at least equal to the contractual term or estimated life of the applicable financial instrument. We also considered the use of the lattice or binomial models\rwith respect to valuing derivative financial instruments that feature anti-dilution price protection; however, the differences\rin the results are insignificant due to the low probability of triggering price adjustments in such financial instruments Stock-based compensation We recognize compensation expense for stock-based compensation\rin accordance with ASC Topic 718. For employee stock-based awards, we calculate the fair value of the award on the date of grant\rusing the Black-Scholes method for stock options and the quoted price of our common stock for unrestricted shares; the expense\ris recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest. For non-employee stock-based awards, we calculate the fair value\rof the award on the date of grant in the same manner as employee awards. However, the awards are revalued at the end of each reporting\rperiod and the pro rata compensation expense is adjusted accordingly until such time the nonemployee award is fully vested, at\rwhich time the total compensation recognized to date equals the fair value of the stock-based award as calculated on the measurement\rdate, which is the date at which the award recipient&#146;s performance is complete. The estimation of stock-based awards that\rwill ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from original estimates, such\ramounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected\rforfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated\rdepreciation. Depreciation is provided for on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for additions\rand improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred\rover the fair value of net assets of business purchased. Goodwill is not being amortized but is evaluated for impairment on at\rleast an annual basis. Impairment of long lived assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances\rindicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For assets that are to be held and used, impairment is recognized\rwhen the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or group of assets is less than their carrying value. If impairment\rexists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying\rvalue and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or internal and external\rappraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value. Income taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income\rtaxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, &#147;Income Taxes.&#148; Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the\ramount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting\rfrom matters that have been recognized in an entity&#146;s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\rare measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are\rexpected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in\rthe results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred\rtax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion\ror all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty\rin income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#146;s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement\rattribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\rASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,\rdisclosure, and transition. We have no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented. Convertible Instruments We evaluate and account for conversion options embedded in\rconvertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815 &#147;Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#148;. Applicable GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion\roptions from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments according to certain\rcriteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument\rare not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that\rembodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes\rin fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument\rwould be considered a derivative instrument. We account for convertible instruments (when we have determined\rthat the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) as follows: We record when necessary,\rdiscounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences\rbetween the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion\rprice embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated\rdate of redemption. The embedded conversion option in connection with our convertible debt could not be exercised unless and until\rwe completed a Qualifying Financing transaction. Accordingly, we determined based on authoritative guidance that the embedded conversion\roption is deemed to be a contingent conversion rather than active conversion option that did not require accounting recognition\rat the commitment dates of the issuances of the Notes. Common Stock Purchase Warrants and\rOther Derivative Financial Instruments We classify as equity any contracts that require physical\rsettlement or net-share settlement or provide us a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in our own shares (physical settlement\ror net-share settlement) provided that such contracts are indexed to our own stock as defined in ASC 815-40 (&#34;Contracts in\rEntity's Own Equity&#34;). We classify as assets or liabilities any contracts that require net-cash settlement (including a requirement\rto net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside our control) or give the counterparty a choice\rof net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). We assess classification of our common\rstock purchase warrants and other free standing derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification\rbetween assets and liabilities is required. Our derivative instruments consisting of warrants to purchase\rour common stock were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following assumptions at December 31, 2012:  Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose us to concentrations\rof credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. We maintain our cash accounts at high quality financial institutions\rwith balances, at times, in excess of Federally insured limits. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold our\rdeposits are financially sound and therefore pose minimal credit risk Research and development Research and development expenditures are charged to operations\ras incurred Going concern The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent\rupon, among other things, the attainment of profitable operations and the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity or\rdebt financing.  These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company&#146;s ability to continue\ras a going concern. Accordingly, the audit report prepared by our independent registered public accounting firm relating to the\rconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 includes an explanatory paragraph\rexpressing substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  Our auditor&#146;s going concern opinion\rmay have a detrimental effect on our ability to obtain additional funding."

S'Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesThe consolidated financial statements as of and for the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011and2010include the accounts of VNR and its subsidiaries. As ofDecember 31, 2010, we consolidated ENP as we had the ability to control the operating and financial decisions and policies of ENP through our ownership of ENP GP and reflected the non-controlling interest as a separate element of members&#8217; equity on our consolidated balance sheet. On December 1, 2011, ENP became a wholly owned subsidiary of VNG. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and include the accounts of all subsidiaries after the elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Additionally, our financial statements for prior periods include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current period presentation. Those reclassifications did not impact our reported net income or members&#8217; equity. The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of allowances for doubtful accounts. We establish provisions for losses on accounts receivable if we determine that it is likely that we will not collect all or part of the outstanding balance. We regularly review collectibility and establish or adjust our allowance as necessary using the specific identification method.Materials, supplies and commodity inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are included in other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.The full cost method of accounting is used to account for oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost method, substantially all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition, development and exploration of oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves are capitalized. These capitalized amounts include the costs of unproved properties, internal costs directly related to acquisitions, development and exploration activities, asset retirement costs and capitalized interest. Under the full cost method, both dry hole costs and geological and geophysical costs are capitalized into the full cost pool, which is subject to amortization and subject to ceiling test limitations as discussed below. Capitalized costs associated with proved reserves are amortized over the life of the reserves using the unit of production method. Conversely, capitalized costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the amortizable base until these properties are evaluated, which occurs on a quarterly basis. Specifically, costs are transferred to the amortizable base when properties are determined to have proved reserves. In addition, we transfer unproved property costs to the amortizable base when unproved properties are evaluated as being impaired and as exploratory wells are determined to be unsuccessful. Additionally, the amortizable base includes estimated future development costs, dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs net of estimated salvage values.Capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling based on the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, computed using the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-the-month commodity prices (the &#8220;12-month average price&#8221;), discounted at10%, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If the ceiling is less than the total capitalized costs, we are required to write-down capitalized costs to the ceiling. We perform this ceiling test calculation each quarter. Any required write downs are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an impairment charge. No ceiling test impairment was required during 2011 or 2010. During the year endedDecember 31, 2012, we recorded a non-cash ceiling test impairment of oil and natural gas properties of $247.7 millionas a result of a decline in natural gas prices at the measurement dates, September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2012. Such impairment was recognized during the third and fourth quarters of 2012. The most significant factor affecting the 2012 impairment related to the properties that we acquired in the Arkoma Basin Acquisition and Rockies Acquisition (discussed below). The fair values of the properties acquired (determined using forward oil and natural gas price curves at the acquisitions dates) were higher than the discounted estimated future cash flows computed using the 12-month average prices at the impairment test measurement dates. We were able to lock in higher future selling prices for a portion of the estimated natural gas production for the Arkoma Basin Acquisition and the Rockies Acquisition by using commodity derivative contracts. However, our impairment calculations do not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions as generally accepted accounting principles only allow us to consider the expected cash flows from derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. The third quarter impairment was calculated based on prices of $2.77per MMBtu for natural gas and$95.26per barrel of crude oil while the fourth quarter impairment was calculated based on prices of$2.76per MMBtu for natural gas and$94.67per barrel of crude oil.When we sell or convey interests in oil and natural gas properties, we reduce oil and natural gas reserves for the amount attributable to the sold or conveyed interest. We do not recognize a gain or loss on sales of oil and natural gas properties unless those sales would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. Sales proceeds on insignificant sales are treated as an adjustment to the cost of the properties.We account for goodwill and other intangible assets under the provisions of the ASC Topic 350,&#8220;Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.&#8221;Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually on October 1 or whenever indicators of impairment exist. As discussed further in Note 2, all goodwill recognized in acquisitions other than the ENP Purchase has been determined to be impaired and written off. The goodwill test is performed at the reporting unit level. Beginning in 2012, the reporting unit for the goodwill recognized for the ENP Purchase represents our oil and natural gas operations in the United States. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We utilize a market approach to determine the fair value of our reporting unit.OnOctober 1,2012,December 1, 2011andOctober 1,2011, we performed impairment tests for the goodwill recognized in the ENP Purchase and our analyses concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of these dates. Significant decreases in the prices of oil and natural gas or significant negative reserve adjustments could change our estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit and could result in an impairment charge.Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets with definite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable.  An impairment loss exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount.We are a party to a contract allowing us to purchase a certain amount of natural gas at a below market price for use as field fuel. As ofDecember 31, 2012, the net carrying value of this contract was$8.7 million. The carrying value is shown as Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the field. The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is$0.2 millionper year.We record a liability for asset retirement obligations at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Subsequently, the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset&#8217;s useful life. Our recognized asset retirement obligation exclusively relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and natural gas wells and decommissioning of our Elk Basin gas plant. Management periodically reviews the estimates of the timing of well abandonments as well as the estimated plugging and abandonment costs, which are discounted at the credit adjusted risk free rate.  These retirement costs are recorded as a long-term liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with an offsetting increase in oil and natural gas properties. An ongoing accretion expense is recognized for changes in the value of the liability as a result of the passage of time, which we record in depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs are recognized when oil, natural gas and NGLs have been delivered to a custody transfer point, persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the rights and responsibility of ownership pass to the purchaser upon delivery, collection of revenue from the sale is reasonably assured, and the sales price is fixed or determinable. We sell oil, natural gas and NGLs on a monthly basis. Virtually all of our contracts&#8217; pricing provisions are tied to a market index, with certain adjustments based on, among other factors, whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line, quality of the oil, natural gas or NGL, and prevailing supply and demand conditions, so that the price of the oil, natural gas and NGL fluctuates to remain competitive with other available oil, natural gas and NGL supplies. To the extent actual volumes and prices of oil and natural gas are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties, the expected sales volumes and prices for those properties are estimated and recorded as &#8220;Trade accounts receivable, net&#8221; in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.The Company has elected the entitlements method to account for gas production imbalances. Gas imbalances occur when we sell more or less than our entitled ownership percentage of total gas production. Any amount received in excess of our share is treated as a liability. If we receive less than our entitled share the underproduction is recorded as a receivable. The amounts of imbalances were not material atDecember 31, 2012and2011. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivative contracts. We control our exposure to credit risk associated with these instruments by (i) placing our assets and other financial interests with credit-worthy financial institutions, (ii) maintaining policies over credit extension that include the evaluation of customers&#8217; financial condition and monitoring payment history, although we do not have collateral requirements and (iii) netting derivative assets and liabilities for counterparties where we have a legal right of offset. AtDecember 31, 2012and2011, the cash and cash equivalents were concentrated inoneandfourfinancial institutions, respectively. We periodically assess the financial condition of these institutions and believe that any possible credit risk is minimal.The following purchasers accounted for10%or more of the Company&#8217;s oil, natural gas and NGLs sales for the years ended December 31:Our customers are in the energy industry and they may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates pertain to proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves and related cash flow estimates used in impairment tests of oil and natural gas properties, the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, goodwill, derivative contracts, asset retirement obligations, accrued oil, natural gas and NGLs revenues and expenses, as well as estimates of expenses related to depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion. Actual results could differ from those estimates.We have entered into derivative contracts with counterparties that are lenders under our financing arrangements to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our oil and natural gas production. While it is never management&#8217;s intention to hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes, conditions sometimes arise where actual production is less than estimated which has, and could, result in overhedged volumes. Pricing for these derivative contracts are based on certain market indexes such as the Henry Hub, Houston Ship Channel, West Texas (&#8220;Waha Index&#8221;), El Paso Natural Gas Company (Permian Basin), Transwestern (Permian), Colorado Interstate Gas Co. (Rocky Mountains Index), Northwest Pipeline Corp. (Rocky Mountains Index), Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp: Zone 4 and CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission Co: East for natural gas production. As for oil production, pricing for the derivative contracts is based on the West Texas Intermediate (&#8220;WTI&#8221;), Light Louisiana Sweet Crude, Wyoming Imperial and Flint Hills Bow River prices. During 2012, our derivative transactions included the following:We also enter into fixed LIBOR interest rate swap agreements with certain counterparties that are lenders under our financing arrangements, which require exchanges of cash flows that serve to synthetically convert a portion of our variable interest rate obligations to fixed interest rates.Any premiums paid on derivative contracts and the fair value of derivative contracts acquired in connection with our acquisitions are capitalized as part of the derivative assets or derivative liabilities, as appropriate, at the time the premiums are paid or the contracts are assumed. Premium payments are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. When the consideration for an acquisition is cash, the fair value of any derivative contracts acquired in the acquisition is reflected in cash flows from investing activities. Over time, as the derivative contracts settle, the differences between the cash received and the premiums paid or fair value of contracts acquired are recognized as a realized loss on commodity or interest rate derivate contracts, and the cash received is reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Under ASC Topic 815,&#8220;Derivatives and Hedging,&#8221;all derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value as either short-term or long-term assets or liabilities based on their anticipated settlement date.  We net derivative assets and liabilities for counterparties where we have a legal right of offset.  Changes in the derivatives&#8217; fair values are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.  For qualifying cash flow hedges, the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the extent the hedge is effective. Gains and losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to gains (losses) on commodity cash flow hedges or gains (losses) on interest rate derivative contracts in the period that the related production is delivered or the contract settles. The realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as gains (losses) on commodity derivative contracts or gains (losses) on interest rate derivative contracts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.We have elected not to designate our current portfolio of derivative contracts as hedges.  Therefore, changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in earnings and included as unrealized gains (losses) on commodity derivative contracts or gains (losses) on interest rate derivative contracts in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company is treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes.  As such, it is not a taxable entity and does not directly pay federal and state income tax. Its taxable income or loss, which may vary substantially from the net income or net loss reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, is included in the federal and state income tax returns of each unitholder.  Accordingly, no recognition has been given to federal and state income taxes for the operations of the Company.  The aggregate difference in the basis of net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined as the Company does not have access to information about each unitholders&#8217; tax attributes in the Company. However, the tax basis of our net assets exceeded the net book basis by$92.2 millionand$41.9 millionatDecember 31, 2012and2011, respectively.Legal entities that conduct business in Texas are subject to the Revised Texas Franchise Tax, including otherwise non-taxable entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability partnerships. The tax is assessed on Texas sourced taxable margin which is defined as the lesser of (i) 70%of total revenue or (ii) total revenue less (a) cost of goods sold or (b) compensation and benefits. Although the Revised Texas Franchise Tax is not an income tax, it has the characteristics of an income tax since it is determined by applying a tax rate to a base that considers both revenues and expenses. The Company recorded a current tax liability of$0.5 millionand$0.7 millionas ofDecember 31, 2012and2011, respectively, and a deferred tax asset of$0.3 millionand$0.2 millionas ofDecember 31, 2012and2011, respectively. Tax provisions of$0.2 million,$0.6 million, and$0.2 millionare included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011, and2010, respectively, as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses.'

("Sealand " or the "Company") is a Nevada corporation in the development stage. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 23, 2011. The Company engages in the manufacture, distribution, sales and marketing of all natural functional beverages, nutriceuticals, health supplements and the harvesting of organic raw materials. The Company integrates critical scientific, environmental and medical competencies in three core areas: exploration/discovery, characterization of health benefits, and the ability to scale up new and natural consumer products for commercial use.&nbsp;The Company is in the development stage as defined under Statement on Financial Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Codification FASB ASC 915-205 "Development-Stage Entities."&nbsp;Basis of presentation&nbsp;The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the year ended May 31, 2014 and 2013 and for the period (inception) from May 23, 2011 through May 31, 2014.&nbsp;Use of estimates&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents&nbsp;The Company maintains a cash balance in an interest and non-interest-bearing accounts. At times, cash balances may be in excess of the FDIC Insurance limit. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of May 31, 2014 and 2013.&nbsp;Property and Equipment&nbsp;The Company values its investment in property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to five years. As of May 31, 2014 and 2013 the company had recognized total depreciation expense of $8,396 and $2,887, respectively.&nbsp;Inventory&nbsp;Inventory is recorded at lower of cost or market; cost is computed on a first-in first-out basis. The inventory consists of imported flavoring , bottle caps, and labels used to produce the Company&#39;s all natural, organic birch tree beverage.&nbsp;Accounts receivable&nbsp;Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount. Management has determined that no allowance for uncollectible accounts is necessary. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management estimates of accounts that will not be collected in the future. Receivables past due for more than 90 days are considered delinquent. Management determines uncollectible accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer&#39;s financial condition, credit history, and current economic conditions and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received. Accounts receivables represents a significant portion of sales as we experienced a delay in receiving payments that was longer than anticipated due to travel time delays and modifications that were made to the terms because of these delays.&nbsp;Field: Page; Sequence: 19; Value: 1On February 20, 2014, the Company entered into a factoring agreement and received $250,000 for certain accounts listed on their accounts receivable. The Company has an obligation to repurchase these shares if the receivable is never collected. Due to this obligation the Company has recorded an accounts receivable holdback liability. The balance of this liability as of May 31, 2014 was $250,000.&nbsp;Revenue Recognition Policy&nbsp;Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the following conditions are satisfied:&nbsp;&nbsp;The time that all of the conditions listed above are satisfied varies with each vendor depending on the specific terms to which the Company and each vendor agree. The range of terms varies from pre-paid sales to 120 day payment.&nbsp;Federal income taxes&nbsp;Deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification regarding Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are provided for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards when realization is more likely than not.&nbsp;Net Income Per Share of Common Stock&nbsp;We have adopted Accounting Standards Codification regarding Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We do not have a complex capital structure requiring the computation of diluted earnings per share.&nbsp;Convertible Debentures:&nbsp;Beneficial Conversion Features -If the conversion features of conventional convertible debt provides for a rate of conversion that is below market value, this feature is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature ("BCF"). A BCF is recorded as a debt discount pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 470-20 "Debt with Conversion and Other Options." In those circumstances, the convertible debt is recorded net of the discount related to the BCF and the Company amortizes the discount to interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method.&nbsp;Field: Page; Sequence: 20; Value: 1Debt Discount- The Company determines of the convertible debenture should be accounted for as liability or equity under FASB ASC 480, Liabilities - Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. FASB ASC 480, applies to certain contract involving a company&#39;s own equity, and requires that issuers classify the following freestanding financial instruments as liabilities. Mandatorily redeemable financial instruments, Obligations that require or may require repurchase of the issuer&#39;s equity shares by transferring assets (e.g., written put options and forward purchase contracts), and Certain obligations where at inception the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on:&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair value of financial instruments and derivative financial instruments&nbsp;We have adopted Accounting Standards Codification regarding Disclosure About Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these items. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, nor do we utilize derivative instruments in the management of foreign exchange, commodity price or interest rate market risks.&nbsp;The Company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash-flow, market or foreign-currency risks. However, the Company has issued financial instruments including senior convertible notes payable and freestanding stock purchase warrants with features that are either (i) not afforded equity classification, (ii) embody risks not clearly and closely related to host contracts, or (iii) may be net-cash settled by the counterparty. As required by FASB ASC 815, in certain circumstances, these instruments are required to be carried as derivative liabilities, at fair value, in our financial statements.&nbsp;Determination of fair value:&nbsp;The Company&#39;s financial instruments consist of convertible notes payable. The Company believes all of the financial instruments&#39; recorded values approximate their fair values because of their nature and respective durations.&nbsp;The Company complies with the provisions of FASB ASC 820-10, "Fair Values Measurements and Disclosures." FASB ASC 820-10 relates to financial assets and financial liabilities. FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions.&nbsp;FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity&#39;s own assumptions, about market participant assumptions, that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consist of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 and Level 2) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).&nbsp;Internal Website Development Costs&nbsp;Under ASC350-50,Website Development Costs, costs and expenses incurred during the planning and operating stages of the Company&#39;s website are expensed as incurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under ASC 350-50, costs incurred in the website application and infrastructure development stages are capitalized by the Company and amortized to expense over the website&#39;s estimated useful life or period of benefit.&nbsp;Field: Page; Sequence: 21; Value: 1Impairment of Long-Lived Assets&nbsp;The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives at each balance sheet date.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed.&nbsp;Deferred Offering and Acquisition Costs&nbsp;The Company defers as other assets the direct incremental costs of raising capital until such time as the offering is completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the completion of the offering, the costs are charged against the capital raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the offering be terminated, deferred offering costs are charged to operations during the period in which the offering is terminated.&nbsp;Common Stock Registration Expenses&nbsp;The Company considers incremental costs and expenses related to the registration of equity securities with the SEC, whether by contractual arrangement as of a certain date or by demand, to be unrelated to original issuance transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, subsequent registration costs and expenses are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as general and administrative expenses, and are expensed as incurred.&nbsp;Development Stage Enterprise&nbsp;The Company&#39;s financial statements are prepared as defined under Statement on Financial Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Codification FASB ASC 915-205 "Development-Stage Entities" pursuant to the provisions of Topic 26, "Accounting for Development Stage Enterprises," as it devotes substantially all of its efforts to acquiring and developing functional beverages that will eventually provide sufficient net profits to sustain the Company&#39;s existence. Until such interests are engaged in major commercial production, the Company will continue to prepare its financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with entities in the development stage.&nbsp;Stock Based Compensation&nbsp;The Company recognizes stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718 "Stock Compensation", which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to an Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the estimated fair values.&nbsp;For non-employee stock-based compensation, we have adopted ASC Topic 505 "Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees", which requires stock-based compensation related to non-employees to be accounted for based on the fair value of the related stock or options or the fair value of the services on the grant date, whichever is more readily determinable in accordance with ASC Topic 718.&nbsp;Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Vendor&nbsp;The Company has no significant off-balance sheet risks related to foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. The Company does maintain its supplier relationship with one vendor. The Company, by policy, routinely assesses the financial strength of this vendor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements&nbsp;As of May 31, 2014 and May 31, 2013, the Company does not expect any of the recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.&nbsp;EndFragment'

S"Basis of Presentation This summary of significant\raccounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company&#146;s financial statements.  The\rfinancial statements and notes are representations of the Company&#146;s management, which is responsible for their integrity\rand objectivity.  These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\rof America (&#147;GAAP&#148;) and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.  Principles of Consolidation The consolidated\rfinancial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, Massive Media Pty Ltd., Massive Interactive\rMedia Ltd., and Wunderkind Group Pty Ltd.  As part of the acquisition of Massive Media Pty Ltd and its controlled entities\rby the Company, it discontinued all oil and gas operations related to properties owned in Texas and Oklahoma.  Financial\rresults related to the oil and gas operations are reported as discontinued operations beginning with the financial results as of\rDecember 31, 2013 (See Note 5Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale). Use of Estimates The preparation of\rconsolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management\rto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets\rand liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual\rresults could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis,\rthe Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable allowance, the useful lives of long-lived\rassets and other intangible assets, and income taxes, among others.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience\rand on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about\rthe carrying value of assets and liabilities as well as reported revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents\rrepresent cash on hand and deposits held at call with banks.  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with\roriginal maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Pursuant to the Accounting\rStandards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) No. 820, &#147;Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments&#148;,\rthe Company records its financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  ASC No. 820 provides a framework for measuring\rfair value, clarifies the definition of fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair\rvalue is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly\rtransaction between market participants at the reporting date.  ASC No. 820 establishes a three-tier hierarchy, which\rprioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value: Level 1&#151;Inputs are unadjusted,\rquoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2&#151;Inputs (other than quoted\rprices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market\rdata at the measurement date and for the duration of the asset/liability&#146;s anticipated life. Level 3&#151;Inputs reflect management&#146;s\rbest estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is\rgiven to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. The carrying values\rfor cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate\rtheir fair value due to their short maturities.  Accounts Receivable Receivables from\rservices are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. Management periodically\rreviews receivables for collectability.  An estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount\ris no longer probable.  Uncollectible receivables are charged off against the allowance account.   An allowance\rfor doubtful accounts of $207,506 and $0 was recorded as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company did not\rhave any off balance-sheet credit exposure relating to its customers, suppliers or others. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments\rthat potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts\rreceivable for which the carrying amounts approximate fair value.  The Company places their cash and cash equivalents\rwith financial institutions with high-credit ratings and quality. The Company conducts\rcredit evaluations of customers and generally does not require collateral or other security from customers.  The Company\restablishes an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the receivables and factors relevant to determining\rthe credit risk of specific customers.  The amount of receivables ultimately not collected by the Company has generally\rbeen consistent with management&#146;s expectations and the allowance established for doubtful accounts. Major customers The Company has 2\rsignificant customers, which accounted for 15% and 27% of the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014.  The Company&#146;s\rsales to its top five customers accounted for approximately 66% and 27% of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 and\r2013, respectively.  These customers accounted for approximately 84% and 34% of accounts receivable balance as of December\r31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Major suppliers The Company had purchases\rfrom five vendors that accounted for approximately 25% and 51% of purchases during the year ended December 31, 2014 and December\r31, 2013, respectively.  These vendors accounted for approximately 22% and 11% of accounts payable balance as of period\rended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Segment Reporting ASC 280,Segment\rReporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments.  Operating segments are defined\ras components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief\roperating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  The\rGroup&#146;s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews consolidated results of operations prepared\rin accordance with US GAAP when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the Group; hence, the\rGroup has only one operating segment, namely the software development services. Income Taxes The Company recognizes\rdeferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax consequences of temporary differences between financial\raccounting bases and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.  Deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently\renacted income tax rates.  The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes for income tax positions taken or expected\rto be taken in an income tax return.  Only income tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold\rwill be recognized. This process includes\ran analysis of whether tax positions the Company takes with regard to a particular item of income or deduction would meet the definition\rof an uncertain tax position under the standards.  Management believes that tax positions taken by the Company with regard\rto income and deduction do not constitute any uncertain tax positions under the standards. Goods and Services Tax/Value Added\rTax The Company's Australian\roperations are subject to the Goods and Services Tax on revenue sales of 10%. The Company's English operations are subject to the\rValue Added Tax on revenue sales of 20%. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes\rrevenue when it is realized and earned. Specifically, the Company recognizes revenue when services are performed and projects are\rcompleted and accepted by the customer. The Company recognizes\rrevenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;)\r985-605 &#147;Software - Revenue Recognition&#148;. Project Services Revenue Revenue derived from\rservices primarily includes consulting, implementation, and training.  Fees are primarily billed under time and materials\rarrangements and are recognized as services are performed. License Fees Revenue License revenue in\rconnection with license agreements for standard proprietary software is recognized upon delivery of the software, provided collection\ris considered probable and the fee is fixed or determinable. Support Revenue Revenue derived from\rtechnical support contracts primarily includes telephone consulting and on-site support as well as error reporting and correction\rservices.  Maintenance contracts are typically sold for a separate fee with initial contractual period of one year with\rrenewal for additional periods thereafter.  Technical support service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of\rthe service agreement. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue\rrepresents advance payments or billings for software licenses, services, and maintenance.  Cost\rof Revenues Cost of revenues\rfor licenses includes amortization of capitalized computer software development costs.  Costs for maintenance and services\rrevenues include the cost of personnel to conduct implementations, customer support and consulting, and other personnel-related\rexpenses. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency\rof the Massive Media Pty Ltd. and Wunderkind Group Pty Ltd. is Australian Dollars (&#147;AUD&#148;). The functional currency\rof Massive Interactive Media Ltd is Great British Pounds (&#34;GBP&#34;). For financial reporting\rpurposes, the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are prepared using each entity's functional currency,\rare translated into the Company&#146;s reporting currency, the United States Dollar (&#147;USD&#148;).  Assets and\rliabilities are translated using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date.  Revenue and expenses are translated using\raverage rates prevailing during each reporting period, and shareholders&#146; equity is translated at historical exchange rates.  Adjustments\rresulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders&#146;\requity. The exchange rates\rapplied are as follows:  Property and Equipment Furniture and office\requipment, electronic equipment and motor vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation\ris calculated based on estimated useful life of the assets.  When furniture and\roffice equipment, electronic equipment and motor vehicles are retired or otherwise disposed of, resulting gain or loss is included\rin net income or loss in the year of disposition for the difference between the net book value and proceeds received thereon. Maintenance\rand repairs which do not improve or extend the expected useful lives of the assets are charged to expenses as incurred.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with\rImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Subsections of FASB ASC Subtopic 360-10,Property, Plant, and Equipment - Overall,\rlong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed\rfor impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If\rcircumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted\rcash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value.  If the carrying value of the\rlong-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent\rthat the carrying value exceeds its fair value.  Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including\rdiscounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.  No\rimpairment of long-lived assets was recognized for the period ended December 31, 2014 and year ended December 31, 2013 respectively.   Capitalized\rComputer Software Development Costs The Company capitalizes\rsoftware development costs in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 985-20Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed.  All\rsoftware development costs are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalization\rceases when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers. The Company makes\rongoing evaluations of the recoverability of its capitalized software projects by comparing the net amount capitalized for each\rproduct to the estimated net realizable value of the product.  If such evaluations indicate that the unamortized software\rdevelopment costs exceed the net realizable value, the Company writes off the amount by which the unamortized software development\rcosts exceed net realizable value.  The Company's capitalized computer software development costs are being amortized\rratably based on the projected revenues associated with the related software or on a straight-line basis over five years, whichever\rmethod results in a higher level of amortization. Intangible Assets The Company amortizes\rintangible assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally as follows: four to nine years for software,\rten to twenty years for customer relationships and trade names, and one to five years for other intangible assets, except goodwill.\rGoodwill is not amortized, but subject to impairment testing.  Operating Leases Leases where substantially\rall the rewards and risks of ownership of assets remain with the lesser are accounted for as operating leases. Payments made under\roperating leases are charged to the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. The Company leases\roffice rental spaces in Sydney, Australia and London, England. Derivative Instruments The Company&#146;s\rdebt or equity instruments may contain embedded derivative instruments, such as conversion options, which in certain circumstances\rmay be required to be bifurcated from the associated host instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument liability. The identification\rof, and accounting for, derivative instruments is complex.  The Company&#146;s derivative instrument liabilities are\rre-valued at the end of each reporting period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative liability recorded as charges or\rcredits to income, in the period in which the changes occur.  For bifurcated conversion options related to the notes\rissued in 2011 (see Note 15Borrowings)that are accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, the Company determines\rthe fair value of these instruments using binomial option pricing model.  That model requires assumptions related to\rthe remaining term of the instrument and risk-free rates of return, the Company&#146;s current Common Stock price and expected\rdividend yield, and the expected volatility of the Company&#146;s Common Stock price over the life of the option. For the bifurcated\rconversion option related to the convertible note issued in 2014 (see Note 15Borrowings) in connection with the Wunderkind\rAcquisition, the Company determined the fair value of the instruments using the Monte Carlo Valuation Model, due to the multitude\rof possible outcomes for the instrument.  This model requires assumptions related to the remaining term of the instrument\rand risk-free rates of return, the Company's current Common Stock price and expected dividend yield, and the expected volatility\rof the Company's Common Stock price over the life of the option. Deemed dividend We incur a deemed\rdividend on Series B Preferred Redeemable Stock. As the conversion rate was less than the deemed fair value of the Common Stock\rof $0.20, the Series B Preferred Redeemable Stock contains a beneficial conversion feature as described in ASC 470.  The\rdifference in the stated conversion price and estimated fair value of the Common Stock is accounted for as a beneficial conversion\rfeature and affects income or loss available to common stockholders for purposes of EPS.   Earnings per Share The Company adopted\rASC 260, &#34;Earnings Per Share&#34; (&#34;EPS&#34;), which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of\rthe income statement for all entities with complex capital structures, and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator\rof the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation.  In the accompanying financial\rstatements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the\rweighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per common share\ris computed by dividing the net income applicable to common stockholders, adjusted on an &#34;as if converted&#34; basis, by\rthe weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities.  Diluted EPS excluded all\rdilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.   The following sets\rforth the computation of diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2014:   Basic net income\rper share is based on the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding.  Potential common\rshares includable in the computation of fully diluted per share results are not presented for the year ended December 31, 2013\rin the consolidated financial statements as their effect would be anti-dilutive.  The total number of shares issuable upon\rconversion of preferred shares that were not included in dilutive earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 15,544,523. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shares The Company is required\rto provide basic and dilutive earnings per common share information.  The basic net loss per common share is computed\rby dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted\rnet loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders, adjusted on an &#34;as if converted&#34;\rbasis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities.  For the years\rended December 31, 2014 and 2013, there were 52,404,633 and 0 shares, respectively. Commitments and Contingencies In the normal course\rof business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that\rcover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, product and environmental liability, and tax\rmatters.  In accordance with ASC 450-20,Accounting for Contingencies, the Company records accruals for such loss\rcontingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  Historically,\rthe Company has not experienced any material service liability claims. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We have adopted recently\rissued accounting pronouncements and have determined that they have no material effect on our financial position, results of operations,\ror cash flow.  We do not expect any recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements to have a material\reffect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. In July 2012, the\rFASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment\r(&#147;ASU 2012-02&#148;), allowing entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary\rto perform the quantitative impairment test.  If the qualitative assessment indicates it is more-likely-than-not that\rthe fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required.  Otherwise,\rno testing is required. ASU 2012-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2013.  The adoption of this\rupdate did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements but may have an impact in future periods. In February 2013,\rthe FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive\rIncome (&#147;ASU 2013-02&#148;).  ASU 2013-02 is intended to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated\rother comprehensive income.  Accordingly, an entity is required to report the effect of significant reclassifications\rout of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required\runder GAAP to be reclassified in its entirety to net income.  For other amounts that are not required under GAAP to be\rreclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures\rrequired under GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts.  ASU 2013-02 is effective for reporting periods\rbeginning after December 15, 2012.  The Company adopted ASU 2013-02 effective January 1, 2013 and the adoption did not\rhave a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. In March 2013 the\rFASB issued ASU 2013-05,Parent&#146;s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries\ror Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity.  This standard is an update\rto clarify existing guidance for the release of cumulative translation adjustments into net income when a parent sells all or a\rpart of its investment in a foreign entity or achieves a business combination of a foreign entity in stages.  The amendments\rin this Update are effective prospectively for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after\rDecember 15, 2013.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations,\rcash flows or financial position. In July 2013 the\rFASB issued ASU 2013-11,Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss,\ror a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.  This guidance to require standard presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit\rwhen a carryforward related to net operating losses or tax credits exists.  The amendments in this Update are effective\rfor fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.  The adoption of this guidance\rdid not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In May 2014 the FASB\rissued ASU 2014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic\r606.  The new revenue recognition standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue\ris recognized.  The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or\rservices to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those\rgoods or services.  This ASU is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal\r2018) and shall be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. \rThe Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. In August 2014, the\rFASB issued ASU 2014-15,Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern-Disclosures of Uncertainties about an entity's\rAbility to Continue as a Going Concern (&#34;ASU 2014-15&#34;). ASU 2014-15 provides new guidance related to management's responsibility\rto evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding\rupon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards and to provide related footnote disclosures. This new guidance\ris effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company\ris currently assessing the impact on the Company's disclosures and financial statements."

S"Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements\rinclude the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\rgenerally accepted in the United States of America.    Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts in the accompanying\rconsolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year&#146;s presentation. These reclassifications\rhad no effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position for any years presented. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements\rinclude the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have\rbeen eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in\rconformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements\rand accompanying notes. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly,\ractual results may differ from those estimates. Risks related to cash The Company maintains cash in bank and deposit\raccounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The\rCompany believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. Cash and Cash equivalents The Company considers only highly liquid investments\rsuch as money market funds and commercial paper with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of their acquisition as cash and\rcash equivalents. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The accounting standards regarding disclosures\rabout fair value of financial instruments defines financial instruments and required fair value disclosure of those instruments.\rThis accounting standard defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement\rand enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. Receivables, investments, payables, short and long term debt and\rwarrant liabilities qualified as financial instruments. Management believes the carrying amounts of receivables, payables and debt\rare a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments, their\rexpected realization, and if applicable, their stated interest rate is equivalent to interest rates currently available. The three\rlevels are defined as follows:    The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of\rboth liabilities and equity under the accounting standards regarding accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics\rof both liabilities and equity, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, accounting for derivative financial\rinstruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company&#146;s own stock, and the accounting standard regarding determining\rwhether an instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an entity&#146;s own stock. The accounting standard specifies that a\rcontract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both (a) indexed to the Company&#146;s own stock and\r(b) classified in stockholders&#146; equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial\rinstrument. This standard provides a two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded\rfeature is indexed to an issuer&#146;s own stock and thus able to qualify for this accounting standard scope exception. All warrants\rissued by the Company are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoice amount and do not\rbear interest. Advertising Cost The Company expenses advertising costs when incurred. Advertising\rexpense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $298,000 and $714,000, respectively. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts is defined as a company's estimate\rof the amount of probable credit losses in the company's existing accounts receivable. The Company does not maintain an allowance\rfor doubtful account based upon management&#146;s review of the Company&#146;s revenue structure whereby substantially all receivables\rare confirmed before they are booked as revenue. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts policy periodically. The\rCompany does not have any off-balance-sheet exposure related to its customers. Inventory The Inventory balance at December 31, 2011 consisted of credit card\rterminals which were stated at the lower of cost (average) or market. We previously supplied dispensaries with credit card processing\rservices. On October 31, 2011, General Merchant Solutions, our wholly owned subsidiary, discontinued all retail credit card processing\roperations. At December 31, 2012, we did not have any inventory. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets,\rgenerally from three to seven years. Including accumulated depreciation related to the assets sold with WeedMaps, property\rand equipment at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $121,000 and $71,000, respectively. Goodwill In accordance withGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\rgoodwill is defined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value assigned to individual assets acquired and liabilities\rassumed and is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on\ran annual basis in the Company's fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The performance of\rthe test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the Company's\rreporting units with each respective reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of reporting units is\rgenerally determined using the income approach. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value,\rthe second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to determine the amount of any impairment loss. The second step of\rthe goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount\rof that goodwill. No amortization is recorded for goodwill with indefinite useful life. No goodwill impairment was recognized during\rthe twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Intangible Assets In accordance withGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\rintangible assets that are determined not to have an indefinite useful life are subject to amortization. The Company amortizes\rintangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets In accordance withAccounting for the Impairment or Disposal\rof Long-Lived Assets, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\rthat the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the long-lived and\rintangible assets by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flow associated with the related assets.\rNo impairment of intangible assets was recognized during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance\rwith the provisions ofShare-Based Payment, which addresses the accounting for equity-based compensation and which requires\rthat the cost of all equity-based compensation arrangements, be reflected in the financial statements over the vesting period based\ron the estimated fair value of the awards. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $210,000\rand zero, respectively, in stock-based compensation expense related to issuances of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock\rto consultants. Treasury Stock We account for treasury stock using the cost method and include\rtreasury stock as a component of shareholders&#146; equity. Other than the share purchases described inNote 3. Equity Transactions,\rwe currently do not have or intend to initiate a share repurchase program. Contingent Consideration &#150; Earn-outs Contingent consideration, the earn-out provisions, which are classified\ras a liability, pursuant to ASC 805, are required to be remeasured to fair value at each reporting date and any changes in fair\rvalue subsequent to the acquisition date are recognized in earnings which could cause a material impact to, and volatility in,\rour operating results. The primary inputs in determining the fair value of the earn-outs that are remeasured to fair value are\rthe quoted price of the underlying shares of our common stock and the probabilities for the three different scenarios in determining\rthe likelihood of common share payouts. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC\r605, &#147;Revenue Recognition,&#148; we recognize as revenue the fees we charge customers as referenced below because\rpersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees we charge are substantially fixed or determinable during the period that\rwe provide the services, we and our customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions, collectability\ris reasonable assured and services have been rendered.  The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries\rrecognize revenue as follows: We generate revenue through attracting internet\rand mobile searchers to our internet properties. The users then frequent our clients who pay us a fee to list on our site. Our Internet properties generate revenues from\rmerchants and advertisers within the industry verticals served. This is the revenue model we employed with WeedMaps.com and is\rthe same revenue model we employ with our current finder sites. The revenue model follows a subscription-based approach, generating\rrecurring monthly revenue from a variety of different package listings, lead generation and advertising. Advertising Package Tiers &#150;For\rour finder sites we typically create advertising package tiers in order to more easily distinguish the different services we offer\rat different price points. The different advertising package tiers also makes it easy for our clients to distinguish which package\rtiers are premium and thus likely to generate more traffic to their brand, product or service. The range of prices we charge for\reach advertising package tier differs per each finder site, per region, and per each tier package. Each region is internally created\rby us based on geographic location, industry density and demographics. Listing Revenue &#150;We generate\rrevenues from fees we charge clients to advertise or list their location, products, and services on one or more of our finder websites.\rWe recognize as revenue the fees we charge customers that advertise or list their related company on our websites. For example, our listing packages typically\rare made up of two groups, Premium Listings and Standard Listings. The most important distinction between Premium Listings and\rStandard Listing packages is typically positioning on our finder websites. This distinction is important because the business that\rappears first in an internet search results list has an increased likelihood of a website visitor clicking on that business and\rthus &#147;converting&#148; the website visitor to a potential customer for our client. In general, being in the top section\rof the search results on any of our finder websites for a given geographical region is deemed preferable because of the increased\rconversion rates (or click-through rates). As a result, we charge a premium dollar amount for a Premium Listing so that the client\ris placed in the top section of search results for a given region. Standard Listing Packages are basic packages\rwhich typically allow a customer to list their brand, product, or service on one or more of our finder sites with the capability\rto edit their listing. A Standard Listing also typically allows a customer to add photos, create a menu, and respond to customer\rreviews, for example. Advertising Revenue &#150;We generate\rrevenues from fees we charge customers for placing ads for their related companies on our websites (i.e. Advertising Packages).\rOur Advertising Packages can include banner ads placed on our finder sites, emails, texts, special promotions, and events. All\rof our Advertising Packages are considered Ad Revenue pursuant to our revenue recognition policy. Content Production Revenue &#150;We\rgenerate revenues from photo and video production of content which is displayed on our finder websites (i.e. Content Production).\rTypically, Content Production that we create on behalf of our clients is considered an add-on or ancillary service. We typically\rcreate video &#147;virtual&#148; tours of our client&#146;s establishments and products, which are then displayed on our finder\rwebsites. We recognize as revenue the fees we charge customers for photo and video production services. All of our Content Production\rservices are considered Content Production Revenue pursuant to our revenue recognition policy. Income Taxes The Company followsAccounting for Income\rTaxesthat requires recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary\rdifferences between the income tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Provision for income taxes consists\rof taxes currently due plus deferred taxes. The charge for taxation is based on the results\rfor the year as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted\ror substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect\rof temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements\rand the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized\rfor all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit\rwill be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates\rthat are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited\rin the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax\ris also recorded in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset\rwhen they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets\rand liabilities on a net basis. Uncertain tax positions The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions\rbased on a benefit recognition model. Provided that the tax position is deemed more likely than not of being sustained, the Company\rrecognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being ultimately realized upon settlement.\rThe tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. The Company classifies income tax-related\rinterest and penalties as interest expense and SGA expense, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements FASB issued an accounting standards update\ramending ASC 220 to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of reporting of comprehensive income. It amends existing\rguidance by allowing only two options for presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income: (1) in a single\rcontinuous financial statement, statement of comprehensive income or (2) in two separate but consecutive financial statements,\rconsisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income. Also, items that are reclassified\rfrom other comprehensive income to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements. ASU No. 2011-05 requires\rretrospective application, and it is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December\r15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. In December 2011, FASB issued ASU 2011-12. ASU 2011-12 indefinitely deferred the provisions\rof ASU 2011-05 requiring the presentation of reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements for items reclassified\rfrom other comprehensive income to net income. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FASB issued an accounting standards update\ramending ASC 820, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2011, to achieve common fair value\rmeasurement and disclosure requirements between GAAP and IFRS. This amendment changes the wording used to describe fair value and\rrequires additional disclosures. The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued an amendment\rto an existing accounting standard, which provides an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment\rtesting on goodwill is necessary. Specifically, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether\rit is necessary to perform the current two-step test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it\ris more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test\ris required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. This standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests\rperformed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our\rfinancial statements. Subsequent Events During May 2009 and February 2010, the FASB\rissued new authoritative pronouncement regarding recognized and non-recognized subsequent events. This guidance establishes general\rstandards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements\rare issued or are available to be issued. The Company adopted this guidance and it had no impact on the Company&#146;s results\rof operations or financial position. Other Recently Issued, but Not Yet Effective\rAccounting Pronouncements Management does not believe that any other\rrecently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying\rconsolidated financial statements."

S"Note 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesWe were incorporated in the state of Washington in 1977. We provide a portfolio of products and services to utilities for the energy and water markets throughout the world.Financial Statement PreparationThe consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the Consolidated Statements of Operations, Shareholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 and the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 of Itron, Inc. and its subsidiaries.Basis of ConsolidationWe consolidate all entities in which we have a greater than 50% ownership interest or in which we exercise control over the operations. We use the equity method of accounting for entities in which we have a 50% or less investment and exercise significant influence. Entities in which we have less than a 20% investment and where we do not exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method. We consider for consolidation any variable interest entity of which we are the primary beneficiary. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, our investments in variable interest entities and noncontrolling interests were not material. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.Cash and Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsAccounts receivable are recorded for invoices issued to customers in accordance with our contractual arrangements. Interest and late payment fees are minimal. Unbilled receivables are recorded when revenues are recognized upon product shipment or service delivery and invoicing occurs at a later date. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our historical experience of bad debts and our specific review of outstanding receivables at period-end. Accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance when we believe an account, or a portion thereof, is no longer collectible.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes raw materials and labor, plus applied direct and indirect costs.Derivative InstrumentsAll derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities. The components and fair values of our derivative instruments, which are primarily interest rate swaps, are determined using the fair value measurements of significant other observable inputs (Level&nbsp;2), as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The net fair value of our derivative instruments may switch between a net asset and a net liability depending on market circumstances at the end of the period. We include the effect of our counterparty credit risk based on current published credit default swap rates when the net fair value of our derivative instruments are in a net asset position and the effect of our own nonperformance risk when the net fair value of our derivative instruments are in a net liability position.For any derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. For any derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. For our hedge of a net investment, the effective portion of any unrealized gain or loss from the foreign currency revaluation of the hedging instrument is reported in OCI as a net unrealized gain or loss on derivative instruments. Ineffective portions of fair value changes or the changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedging activities are recognized in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We classify cash flows from our derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.&nbsp;Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives are with major international financial institutions, with whom we have master netting agreements; however, our derivative positions are not disclosed on a net basis. There are no credit-risk-related contingent features within our derivative instruments. Refer to Note 7 for further disclosures of our derivative instruments and their impact on OCI.Property, Plant, and EquipmentProperty, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally thirty years for buildings and improvements and three to five years for machinery and equipment, computers and purchased software, and furniture. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the term of the applicable lease, including renewable periods if reasonably assured, or over the useful lives, whichever is shorter. Construction in process represents capital expenditures incurred for assets not yet placed in service. Costs related to internally developed software and software purchased for internal uses are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. We have no major planned maintenance activities.We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We have had no significant impairments of long-lived assets. Assets held for sale are classified within other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. We had no assets held for sale at December&nbsp;31, 2010 or 2009.Prepaid Debt FeesPrepaid debt fees represent the capitalized direct costs incurred related to the issuance of debt and are recorded as noncurrent assets. These costs are amortized to interest expense over the lives of the respective borrowings, including contingent maturity or call features, using the effective interest method, or straight-line method when associated with a revolving credit facility. When debt is repaid early, the related portion of unamortized prepaid debt fees is written-off and included in interest expense.Business CombinationsOn the date of acquisition, the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree are recorded at their fair values. The acquiree results of operations are also included as of the date of acquisition in the consolidated results. Intangible assets that arise from contractual/legal rights, or are capable of being separated, as well as in-process research and development, are measured and recorded at fair value, and amortized over the estimated useful life. If practicable, assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies are measured and recorded at fair value. If not practicable, such assets and liabilities are measured and recorded when it is probable that a gain or loss has occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The residual balance of the purchase price, after fair value allocations to all identified assets and liabilities, represents goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Restructuring costs are generally expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties, including penalties and interest, after the measurement period are recognized as a component of provision for income taxes.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill and intangible assets have resulted from our acquisitions. We use estimates in determining and assigning the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets at acquisition, including estimates of useful lives of intangible assets, the amount and timing of related future cash flows, and fair values of the related operations. Our intangible assets have finite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on estimated discounted cash flows, and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.Goodwill is assigned to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination, determined by using certain financial metrics, including the forecasted discounted cash flows associated with each reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment as of October&nbsp;1 of each year, or more frequently if a significant impairment indicator occurs. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We forecast discounted future cash flows at the reporting unit level using risk-adjusted discount rates and estimated future revenues and operating costs, which take into consideration factors such as existing backlog, expected future orders, supplier contracts, and expectations of competitive and economic environments. We also identify similar publicly traded companies and develop a correlation, referred to as a multiple, to apply to the operating results of our reporting units.&nbsp;ContingenciesA loss contingency is recorded if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss. Loss contingencies that we determine to be reasonably possible, but not probable, are disclosed. Changes in these factors and related estimates could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.Bonus and Profit SharingWe have various employee bonus and profit sharing plans, which provide award amounts for the achievement of annual financial and nonfinancial targets. If management determines it is probable that the targets will be achieved, and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, a compensation accrual is recorded based on the proportional achievement of the financial and nonfinancial targets. Although we monitor and accrue expenses quarterly based on our progress toward the achievement of the annual targets, the actual results at the end of the year may require awards that are significantly greater or less than the estimates made in earlier quarters.WarrantyWe offer standard warranties on our hardware products and large application software products. We accrue the estimated cost of warranty claims based on historical and projected product performance trends and costs. Testing of new products in the development stage helps identify and correct potential warranty issues prior to manufacturing. Continuing quality control efforts during manufacturing reduce our exposure to warranty claims. If our quality control efforts fail to detect a fault in one of our products, we could experience an increase in warranty claims. We track warranty claims to identify potential warranty trends. If an unusual trend is noted, an additional warranty accrual may be assessed and recorded when a failure event is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Management continually evaluates the sufficiency of the warranty provisions and makes adjustments when necessary. The warranty allowances may fluctuate due to changes in estimates for material, labor, and other costs we may incur to repair or replace projected product failures, and we may incur additional warranty and related expenses in the future with respect to new or established products, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. The long-term warranty balance includes estimated warranty claims beyond one year. Warranty expense is classified within cost of revenues.Defined Benefit Pension PlansWe sponsor both funded and unfunded non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We recognize a liability for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets or an asset for plan assets in excess of the projected benefit obligation. We also recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize as a component of OCI, net of tax, the actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits, if any, that arise during the period but that are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.Revenue RecognitionRevenues consist primarily of hardware sales, software license fees, software implementation, project management services, installation, consulting, and post-sale maintenance support. Revenues are recognized when (1)&nbsp;persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2)&nbsp;delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3)&nbsp;the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (4)&nbsp;collectability is reasonably assured.The majority of our revenue arrangements involve multiple deliverables, which combine two or more of the following: hardware, meter reading system software, installation, and project management services. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a standalone basis and delivery/performance of the undelivered item(s) is probable. The total arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values and the applicable revenue recognition criteria considered for each unit of accounting. The amount allocable to a delivered item is limited to the amount that we are entitled to collect and that is not contingent upon the delivery/performance of additional items. Revenues for each deliverable are then recognized based on the type of deliverable, such as 1) when the products are shipped, 2) services are delivered, 3) percentage-of-completion when implementation services are essential to other deliverables in the arrangements, 4) upon receipt of customer acceptance, or 5) transfer of title. The majority of our revenue is recognized when products are shipped to or received by a customer or when services are provided.We primarily enter into two types of multiple deliverable arrangements, which include a combination of hardware and associated software and services:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also enter into multiple deliverable software arrangements that do not include hardware. For this type of arrangement, revenue recognition is dependent upon the availability of vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) for fair value for each of the deliverables. The lack of VSOE, or the existence of extended payment terms or other inherent risks, may affect the timing of revenue recognition for software arrangements.Certain of our revenue arrangements include an extended or noncustomary warranty provision which covers all or a portion of a customer's replacement or repair costs beyond the standard or customary warranty period. Whether or not the extended warranty is separately priced in the arrangement, a portion of the arrangement's total consideration is allocated to this extended warranty deliverable. This revenue is deferred and recognized over the extended warranty coverage period. Extended/noncustomary warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue.On January&nbsp;1, 2010, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13,Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) &ndash; Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Tax Force)and ASU 2009-14,Software (Topic 985), Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)on a prospective basis for new arrangements and arrangements that are materially modified. This new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, as we already had the ability to divide the deliverables within our revenue arrangements into separate units of accounting. Further, there would have been no change to the amount of revenue recognized in the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 or 2008 if arrangements prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 had been subject to the measurement requirements of this new guidance.We allocate consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price. We determine selling price using VSOE, if it exists, otherwise we use third-party evidence (TPE). If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a unit of accounting, we use estimated selling price (ESP).VSOE is generally limited to the price charged when the same or similar product is sold separately or, if applicable, the stated renewal rate in the agreement. If a product or service is seldom sold separately, it is unlikely that we can determine VSOE for the product or service. We define VSOE as a median price of recent standalone transactions that are priced within a narrow range. TPE is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately.For arrangements entered into or materially modified after January&nbsp;1, 2010, if we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP in the allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product or service were sold by us on a standalone basis. Our determination of ESP involves a weighting of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of the arrangement. Specifically, we consider the cost to produce the deliverable, the anticipated margin on that deliverable, the selling price and profit margin for similar parts, our ongoing pricing strategy and policies (as evident in the price list established and updated by management on a regular basis), the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable, and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold. We analyze the selling prices used in our allocation of arrangement consideration on an annual basis. Selling prices are analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices.Unearned revenue is recorded when a customer pays for products or services, but the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met as of the balance sheet date. Unearned revenues of $42.8 million and $45.4 million at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 related primarily to professional services and software associated with our smart metering contracts, extended warranty, and prepaid post-contract support. Deferred cost is recorded for products or services for which ownership (typically defined as title and risk of loss) has transferred to the customer, but the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met as of the balance sheet date. Deferred costs were $10.0 million and $19.7 million at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 and are recorded within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.In all cases, hardware and software post-sale maintenance support fees are recognized ratably over the life of the related service contract. Shipping and handling costs and incidental expenses billed to customers are recorded as revenue, with the associated cost charged to cost of revenues. We record sales, use, and value added taxes billed to our customers on a net basis.Product and Software Development CostsProduct and software development costs primarily include employee compensation and third party contracting fees. For software we develop to be marketed or sold, we capitalize development costs after technological feasibility is established. Due to the relatively short period of time between technological feasibility and the completion of product and software development, and the immaterial nature of these costs, we generally do not capitalize product and software development expenses.Stock-Based CompensationWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock sold pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), and the issuance of restricted and unrestricted stock awards and units, based on estimated fair values. The fair values of stock options and ESPP awards are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which includes assumptions for the dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected life. For restricted and unrestricted stock awards and units, the fair value is the market close price of our common stock on the date of grant. We expense stock-based compensation, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, using the straight-line method over the required vesting period. Excess tax benefits are credited to common stock when the deduction reduces cash taxes payable. When we have tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost, they are classified as financing cash inflows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, NetUpon partial or full redemption of our borrowings, we recognize a gain or loss for the difference between the cash paid and the net carrying amount of the debt redeemed. Included in the net carrying amount is any unamortized premium or discount from the original issuance of the debt. Due to the particular characteristics of our convertible notes, we recognize a gain or loss upon conversion or derecognition for the difference between the net carrying amount of the liability component (including any unamortized discount and debt issuance costs) and the fair value of the consideration transferred to the holder that is allocated to the liability component, which is equal to the fair value of the liability component immediately prior to extinguishment. In the case of an induced conversion, a loss is recognized for the amount of the fair value of the securities or other consideration transferred to the holder in excess of fair value of the consideration issuable in accordance with the original conversion terms of the debt.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences, in each of the jurisdictions that we operate, attributable to: (1)&nbsp;the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases; and (2)&nbsp;operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves applying complex tax regulations in different tax jurisdictions to our tax positions. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is not more likely than not that such assets will be realized. We do not record tax liabilities on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested.&nbsp;Foreign ExchangeOur consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date, or the last business day of the period, if applicable. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using a weighted average rate for the relevant reporting period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included, net of tax, in OCI. Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations for monetary asset and liability balances that are not denominated in an entity's functional currency are included within other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Currency gains and losses of intercompany balances deemed to be long-term in nature or designated as a hedge of the net investment in international subsidiaries are included, net of tax, in OCI.Fair Value MeasurementsFor assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the GAAP fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in different valuation methodologies, assigning the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in actively traded markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in non-active markets; and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are corroborated by observable market data either directly or indirectly through correlation or other means (inputs may include yield curves, volatility, credit risks, and default rates). We hold no assets or liabilities measured using Level 1 fair value inputs.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Due to various factors affecting future costs and operations, actual results could differ materially from these estimates.New Accounting PronouncementsIn April 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-13,Effect of Denominating the Exercise Price of a Share-Based Payment Award in the Currency of the Market in Which the Underlying Equity Security Primarily Trades, to eliminate disparity in practice. ASU 2010-13 clarifies that differences between currencies of the underlying equity securities of the share-based payment award and the functional currency of the employer entity or the employee's payroll currency should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. This pronouncement will be effective on January&nbsp;1, 2011 and will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as we treat this type of share-based payment award as equity."

S"NOTE 2 -SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESUse of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company has invested some of its excess cash in debt instruments of the United States Government. All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Estimated useful lives are generally as follows: fixtures, equipment and software--3 to 6 years; and leasehold improvements--lower of life or term of lease.GoodwillIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 350, &#8220;Intangibles-Goodwill and Other&#8221;, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually and if a triggering event were to occur in an interim period. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the book value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not required. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill with the book value of that goodwill. If the book value of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests for 2015 and 2014 during the fourth quarter of each year and determined there was no impairment of existing goodwill. Long-Lived AssetsThe Company reviews its long-lived amortizable assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360, &#8220;Property, Plant and Equipment&#8221;. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted pre-tax future net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.As of December 31, 2015, management believes no impairment oflong-lived assets has occurred.Income TaxesThe Company provides for deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between financial statement and income tax reporting. Temporary differences are differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported for financial statement purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will be taxable in future years&#8217; tax returns. Deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will be deductible in future years&#8217; tax returns and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.Revenue RecognitionCreditRiskMonitor&#8217;s North American and worldwide service is sold on a subscription basis pursuant to customer contracts that span varying periods of time, but are generally for a period of one year. The Company initially records amounts billed as accounts receivable and defers the related revenue until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenues are recognized ratably over the related subscription period. Revenue from the Company&#8217;s third-party international credit report service is recognized as information is delivered and products and services are used by customers.Income Per ShareIncome per share is computed under the provisions of ASC 260, &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221;. Amounts reported as basic and diluted net income per share for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2015 reflect the net income for the year divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the year and the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted for the effects of potentially dilutive securities (see Note 9). Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 820, &#8220;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;). This pronouncement requires that the Company calculate the fair value of financial instruments and include this additional information in the notes to the financial statements when the fair value is different than the book value of those financial instruments. The Company believes the recorded value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and other liabilities approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.Comprehensive IncomeThe Company adheres to the provisions of ASC 220, &#8220;Comprehensive Income&#8221;. This pronouncement establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income or loss and its components (revenues, expenses, gains and losses). The statement requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be classified by their nature. Furthermore, the Company is required to display the accumulated balances of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no items that gave rise to other comprehensive income or loss and net income equaled comprehensive income.Segment InformationThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 280, &#8220;Segment Reporting&#8221;. This pronouncement establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to stockholders. The pronouncement also establishes standards for related disclosure about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company currently believes it operates in one segment.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company adopted ASC 718, &#8220;Compensation-Stock Compensation&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;), at the beginning of fiscal 2006 utilizing the modified prospective method, which does not require restatement of prior periods. The modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock awards over the requisite service period (generally the vesting schedule).See Note 6 for more information regarding the Company&#8217;s stock compensation plans. Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company records its financial instruments that are accounted for under ASC 320, &#8220;Investments-Debt and Equity Securities&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 320&#8221;) at fair value. The determination of fair value is based upon the fair value framework established by ASC 820. ASC 820 provides that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the source of inputs as follows: (a) Level 1   valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; (b) Level 2   valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable; either directly or indirectly; and (c) Level 3   valuations based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable; thus, reflecting assumptions about the market participants.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsThe FASB and the SEC had issued certain accounting pronouncements as of December 31, 2015 that will become effective in subsequent periods; however, management does not believe that any of those pronouncements would have significantly affected our financial accounting measurements or disclosures had they been in effect during the interim periods for which financial statements are included in this annual report, nor does management believe those pronouncements would have a significant effect on our future financial position or results of operations.Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit and other accounts, the balances of which, at times, may exceed Federally insured limits. Exposure to credit risk is reduced by placing such deposits in high credit quality financial institutions.The Company closely monitors the extension of credit to its customers. The Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balance is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company does not require collateral or other security to support credit sales, but provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specifically identified risks. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management determines that recovery is unlikely and the Company ceases collection efforts. The Company does not believe that significant credit risk existed at December 31, 2015 and 2014.Stock SplitOn October 21, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a 1.3-for-1 split of its common stock, in the form of a 30% stock dividend, payable to stockholders of record as of November 30, 2015. Shares resulting from the split were issued on December 15, 2015. In connection therewith, the Company transferred $24,745 from accumulated deficit to common stock, representing the par value of additional shares issued. As a result of the stock split, fractional shares equal to 110 whole shares were repurchased for $411. All share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split."

S'egxNote 2 -Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices&nbsp;The Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application.&nbsp; Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Company&#146;s financial condition and results and require management&#146;s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company&#146;s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.&nbsp;Basis of Presentation&nbsp;The Company\'s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).&nbsp;Use of Estimates and Assumptions&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).&nbsp;Critical accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Company&#146;s critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were:&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowance for doubtful accounts:Management&#146;sestimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical sales, historical loss levels, and an analysis of the collectability of individual accounts;and general economic conditions that may affect a client&#146;s ability to pay. The Company evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the allowance in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair value of long-lived assets:Fair value is generally determined using the asset&#146;s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.&nbsp; If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. The Company considers the following to be some examples of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i)&nbsp;significant under-performance or losses of assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii)&nbsp;significant changes in the manner or use of assets or in the Company&#146;s overall strategy with respect to the manner or use of the acquired assets or changes in the Company&#146;s overall business strategy; (iii)&nbsp;significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv)&nbsp;increased competitive pressures; (v)&nbsp;a significant decline in the Company&#146;s stock price for a sustained period of time; and (vi)&nbsp;regulatory changes.&nbsp; The Company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets:Management assumes that the realization of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) carry&#150;forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses, (b) general economic conditions, and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates and assumptions used in valuation of equity instruments: Management estimatesexpected term of share options and similar instruments, expected volatility of the Company&#146;s common shares and the method used to estimate it, expected annual rate of quarterly dividends, and risk free rate(s) to value share options and similar instruments.&nbsp;These significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.&nbsp;Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.&nbsp;Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.&nbsp;Actual results could differ from those estimates.&nbsp;Fair Value of Financial Instruments&nbsp;The Company follows applicable accounting guidance for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. U.S. GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements.&nbsp; To provide consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.&nbsp; The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.&nbsp; The three levels of fair value hierarchy are described below:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.&nbsp;If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.&nbsp;The carrying amounts of the Company&#146;s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, prepayments and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, payroll taxes payable, and due to factor, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s notes payable, convertible notes payable, convertible secured notes payable, and capital leases payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon management&#146;s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2013 and 2012.&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the derivative financial instruments for which there is no current market for these securities such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company valued the automatic conditional conversion, re-pricing/down-round, change of control; default and follow-on offering provisions using a lattice model, with the assistance of a valuation specialist, for which management understands the methodologies. These models incorporate transaction details such as Company stock price, contractual terms, maturity, risk free rates, as well as assumptions about future financings, volatility, and holder behavior as of the date of issuance and each balance sheet date.&nbsp;Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm\'s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist.&nbsp; Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm\'s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.&nbsp;Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis&nbsp;Level 3 Financial Liabilities &#150; Derivative Financial Instruments&nbsp;The Company uses Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of the derivative liabilities and revalues its derivative liability at the end of every reporting period and recognizes gains or losses in the Statements of Operations that are attributable to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability.&nbsp;Carrying Value, Recoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets&nbsp;The Company has adopted paragraph 360-10-35-17 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company&#146;s long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, patents, and website development costs are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&nbsp;The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.&nbsp; Fair value is generally determined using the asset&#146;s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.&nbsp; When long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives.&nbsp;The Company considers the following to be some examples of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i)&nbsp;significant under-performance or losses of assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii)&nbsp;significant changes in the manner or use of assets or in the Company&#146;s overall strategy with respect to the manner or use of the acquired assets or changes in the Company&#146;s overall business strategy; (iii)&nbsp;significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv)&nbsp;increased competitive pressures; (v)&nbsp;a significant decline in the Company&#146;s stock price for a sustained period of time; and (vi)&nbsp;regulatory changes.&nbsp; The Company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.&nbsp;The key assumptions used in management&#146;s estimates of projected cash flow deal largely with forecasts of sales levels, gross margins, and operating costs of the manufacturing facilities.&nbsp; These forecasts are typically based on historical trends and take into account recent developments as well as management&#146;s plans and intentions.&nbsp; Any difficulty in manufacturing or sourcing raw materials on a cost effective basis would significantly impact the projected future cash flows of the Company&#146;s manufacturing facilities and potentially lead to an impairment charge for long-lived assets.&nbsp; Other factors, such as increased competition or a decrease in the desirability of the Company&#146;s products, could lead to lower projected sales levels, which would adversely impact cash flows.&nbsp; A significant change in cash flows in the future could result in an impairment of long lived assets.&nbsp;The impairment charges, if any, is included in operating expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.&nbsp;Cash Equivalents&nbsp;The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.&nbsp;Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts&nbsp;Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.&nbsp; The Company follows paragraph 310-10-50-9 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts.&nbsp; The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer&#146;s current credit worthiness, as determined by the review of their current credit information; and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical write-off experience, customer specific facts and economic conditions.&nbsp;Pursuant to paragraph 310-10-50-2 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.&nbsp; The Company has adopted paragraph 310-10-50-6 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and determine when receivables are past due or delinquent based on how recently payments have been received.&nbsp;Outstanding account balances are reviewed individually for collectability.&nbsp; The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company&#146;s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company&#146;s existing accounts receivable. Bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses, if any.&nbsp;The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure to its customers.&nbsp;Property and Equipment&nbsp;Property and equipment are recorded at cost.&nbsp; Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized.&nbsp; Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.&nbsp; Depreciation of property and equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective estimated residual values) over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the statements of operations.&nbsp;Leases&nbsp;Lease agreements are evaluated to determine whether they are capital leases or operating leases in accordance with applicable paragraph 840-10-25-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 840-10-25-1&#148;). Pursuant to Paragraph 840-10-25-1 A lessee and a lessor shall consider whether a lease meets any of the following four criteria as part of classifying the lease at its inception under the guidance in the Lessees Subsection of this Section (for the lessee) and the Lessors Subsection of this Section (for the lessor): a. Transfer of ownership. The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term. This criterion is met in situations in which the lease agreement provides for the transfer of title at or shortly after the end of the lease term in exchange for the payment of a nominal fee, for example, the minimum required by statutory regulation to transfer title. b.&nbsp;Bargain purchase option. The lease contains a bargain purchase option. c.&nbsp;Lease term. The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. d.&nbsp;Minimum lease payments. The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at lease inception over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. In accordance with paragraphs 840-10-25-29 and 840-10-25-30, if at its inception a lease meets any of the four lease classification criteria in Paragraph 840-10-25-1, the lease shall be classified by the lessee as a capital lease; and if none of the four criteria in Paragraph 840-10-25-1 are met, the lease shall be classified by the lessee as an operating lease. Pursuant to Paragraph 840-10-25-31 a lessee shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using the lessee\'s incremental borrowing rate unless both of the following conditions are met, in which circumstance the lessee shall use the implicit rate: a.&nbsp;It is practicable for the lessee to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor. b.&nbsp;The implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee\'s incremental borrowing rate.&nbsp; Capital lease assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the capital lease assets\' estimated useful lives consistent with the Company&#146;s normal depreciation policy for tangible assets, but generally not exceeding the term of the lease. Interest charges are expensed over the term of the lease in relation to the carrying value of the capital lease obligation.&nbsp;Operating leases primarily relate to the Company&#146;s leases of office spaces. When the terms of an operating lease include tenant improvement allowances, periods of free rent, rent concessions, and/or rent escalation amounts, the Company establishes a deferred rent liability for the difference between the scheduled rent payment and the straight-line rent expense recognized, which is amortized over the underlying lease term on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense.&nbsp;Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill&nbsp;The Company has adopted Subtopic 350-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for intangible assets other than goodwill.&nbsp; Under the requirements, the Company amortizes the acquisition costs of intangible assets other than goodwill on a straight-line basis over or their estimated useful lives, the terms of the exclusive licenses and/or agreements, or the terms of legal lives of the patents, whichever is shorter.&nbsp; Upon becoming fully amortized, the related cost and accumulated amortization are removed from the accounts.&nbsp;Patents&nbsp;For acquired patents the Company records the costs to acquire patents as patent and amortizes the patent acquisition cost over its remaining legal life, or estimated useful life, or the term of the contract, whichever is shorter. For internal developed patents, all costs incurred to the point when a patent application is to be filed are expended as incurred as research and development expense; patent application costs, generally legal costs, thereafter incurred are capitalized, which are to be amortized once the patents are granted or expended if the patent application is rejected. The Company amortizes the internal developed patents over the shorter of the expected useful lives or the legal lives of the patents, which are generally 17 to 20 years for domestic patents and 5 to 20 years for foreign patents from the date when the patents are granted. The costs of defending and maintaining patents are expended as incurred. Upon becoming fully amortized, the related cost and accumulated amortization are removed from the accounts.&nbsp;Website Development Costs&nbsp;The Company has adopted Subtopic 350-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for website development costs.&nbsp; Under the requirements of Sections 350-50-15 and 350-50-25, the Company capitalizes costs incurred to develop a website as website development costs, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of three (3) years. Upon becoming fully amortized, the related cost and accumulated amortization are removed from the accounts.&nbsp;Discount on Debt&nbsp;The Company allocates the proceeds received from convertible debt instruments between the liability component and equity component, and records the conversion feature as a liability in accordance with subtopic 470-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Subtopic 470-20&#148;). The conversion feature and certain other features that are considered embedded derivative instruments, such as a conversion reset provision, a penalty provision and redemption option, have been recorded at their fair value as its fair value can be separated from the convertible note and its conversion is independent of the underlying note value. The conversion liability is marked to market each reporting period with the resulting gains or losses shown in the Statement of Operations. The Company has also recorded the resulting discount on debt related to the warrants and conversion feature and is amortizing the discount using the effective interest rate method over the life of the debt instruments.&nbsp;Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&nbsp;The Company accounts for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with paragraph 810-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 810-10-05-4&#148;). Paragraph 810-10-05-4 requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value.&nbsp; The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends upon: (i) whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and (ii) the type of hedging relationship.&nbsp; For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.&nbsp;Derivative Warrant Liability&nbsp;The Company evaluates its convertible debt, options, warrants or other contracts, if any, to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with paragraph 810-10-05-4 and Section 815-40-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.&nbsp; The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as either an asset or a liability.&nbsp; In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as other income or expense.&nbsp; Upon conversion, exercise or cancellation of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the date of conversion, exercise or cancellation and then that the related fair value is reclassified to equity.&nbsp;In circumstances where the embedded conversion option in a convertible instrument is required to be bifurcated and there are also other embedded derivative instruments in the convertible instrument that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument.&nbsp;The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.&nbsp; Derivative instrument liabilities will be classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is expected within 12 months of the balance sheet date.&nbsp;The Company marks to market the fair value of the remaining embedded derivative warrants at each balance sheet date and records the change in the fair value of the remaining embedded derivative warrants as other income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).&nbsp;The Company utilizes the Lattice model that values the liability of the derivative warrants based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow model with the assistance of the third party valuation firm.&nbsp; The reason the Company picks the Lattice model is that in many cases there may be multiple embedded features or the features of the bifurcated derivatives may be so complex that a Black-Scholes valuation does not consider all of the terms of the instrument.&nbsp; Therefore, the fair value may not be appropriately captured by simple models.&nbsp; In other words, simple models such as Black-Scholes may not be appropriate in many situations given complex features and terms of conversion option (e.g., combined embedded derivatives).&nbsp; The Lattice model is based on future projections of the various potential outcomes. The features that were analyzed and incorporated into the model included the exercise and full reset features.&nbsp; Based on these features, there are two primary events that can occur; the Holder exercises the Warrants or the Warrants are held to expiration. The Lattice model analyzed the underlying economic factors that influenced which of these events would occur, when they were likely to occur, and the specific terms that would be in effect at the time (i.e. stock price, exercise price, volatility, etc.).&nbsp; Projections were then made on the underlying factors which led to potential scenarios.&nbsp; Probabilities were assigned to each scenario based on management projections.&nbsp; This led to a cash flow projection and a probability associated with that cash flow.&nbsp; A discounted weighted average cash flow over the various scenarios was completed to determine the value of the derivative warrants.&nbsp;Embedded Beneficial Conversion Feature of Convertible Instruments&nbsp;The Company recognizes and measures the embedded beneficial conversion feature of applicable convertible instruments by allocating a portion of the proceeds from the convertible instruments equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital. The intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature is calculated at the commitment date as the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of the securities into which the convertible instruments are convertible. The Company recognizes the intrinsic value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature of the convertible notes so computed as interest expense.&nbsp;From time to time, the Company transfers the liability under the indenture instrument to a third party in certain circumstances.&nbsp;Related Parties&nbsp;The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.&nbsp;Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include a.&nbsp;affiliates of the Company; b.&nbsp;entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825&#150;10&#150;15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c.&nbsp;trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the Company; e.&nbsp;management of the Company; f.&nbsp;other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g.&nbsp;other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.&nbsp;The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include:&nbsp; a.&nbsp;the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c.&nbsp;the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.&nbsp;Commitment and Contingencies&nbsp;The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.&nbsp; The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment.&nbsp; In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.&nbsp;If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.&nbsp; If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.&nbsp;Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.&nbsp; Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company&#146;s business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.&nbsp;Revenue Recognition&nbsp;The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition.&nbsp; The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.&nbsp; The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.&nbsp;The Company derives its revenues from sales contracts with customers with revenues being generated upon the shipment of products.&nbsp; Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is demonstrated via sales invoice or contract; product delivery is evidenced by warehouse shipping log as well as a signed bill of lading from the third party carrier and title transfers upon shipment, based on free on board (&#147;FOB&#148;) warehouse terms; the sales price to the customer is fixed upon acceptance of the signed purchase order or contract and there is no separate sales rebate, discount, or volume incentive. &nbsp;When the Company recognizes revenue, no provisions are made for returns because, historically, there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that have impacted the ultimate collection of revenues.&nbsp;In addition to the aforementioned general policy, the following are the specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of products and services:&nbsp;Hardware&nbsp;Revenue from hardware sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and there are either no unfulfilled Company obligations or any obligations that will not affect the customer\'s final acceptance of the arrangement.&nbsp; All costs of these obligations are accrued when the corresponding revenue is recognized.&nbsp; There were no revenues from fixed price long-term contracts.&nbsp;Software, Services and Maintenance&nbsp;Revenue from time and service contracts is recognized as the services are provided. Revenue from delivered elements of one-time charge licensed software is recognized at the inception of the license term, provided the Company has vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of each delivered element.&nbsp; Revenue is deferred for undelivered elements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses when the four criteria discussed above are met. Delivery generally occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier or the software is downloaded via email delivery or an FTP web site. The Company assesses collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer.&nbsp; The Company does not request collateral from customers.&nbsp; If the Company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, the Company defers the fee and recognizes revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.&nbsp; Revenue from monthly software licenses is recognized on a subscription basis.&nbsp;ASP Hosted Cloud Services&nbsp;The Company offers an Application Service Provider Cloud Service whereby customer usage transactions are invoiced monthly on a cost per transaction basis.&nbsp; The service is sold via the execution of a Service Agreement between the Company and the customer.&nbsp; Initial set-up fees are recognized over the period in which the services are performed.&nbsp;Fixed Price Service Contracts&nbsp;Revenue from fixed price service contracts is recognized over the term of the contract based on the percentage of services that are provided during the period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract.&nbsp; Losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent.&nbsp; Revenue from maintenance is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed.&nbsp; Revenue in excess of billings on service contracts is recorded as unbilled receivables and is included in trade accounts receivable.&nbsp; Applicable billings in excess of revenue that is recognized on service contracts are recorded as deferred income until the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria are met.&nbsp;Stock-Based Compensation for Obtaining Employee Services&nbsp;The Company accounts for its stock based compensation in which the Company obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions under the recognition and measurement principles of the fair value recognition provisions of section 718-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-30-6 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.&nbsp; The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.&nbsp; If the Company is a newly formed corporation or shares of the Company are thinly traded the use of share prices established in the Company&#146;s most recent private placement memorandum (&#147;PPM&#148;), or weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.&nbsp;The fair value of share options and similar instruments is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model.&nbsp; The ranges of assumptions for inputs are as follows:&nbsp;Expected term of share options and similar instruments: The expected life of options and similar instruments represents the period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding.&nbsp; Pursuant to Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(i) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the expected term of share options and similar instruments represents the period of time the options and similar instruments are expected to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual term of the instruments and employees&#146; expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior into the fair value (or calculated value) of the instruments.&nbsp; Pursuant to paragraph 718-10-S99-1, it may be appropriate to use thesimplified method,i.e., expected term = ((vesting term + original contractual term) / 2), if (i) A company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time its equity shares have been publicly traded; (ii) A company significantly changes the terms of its share option grants or the types of employees that receive share option grants such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term; or (iii) A company has or expects to have significant structural changes in its business such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The Company uses the simplified method to calculate expected term of share options and similar instruments as the company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.&nbsp;Expected volatility of the entity&#146;s shares and the method used to estimate it.&nbsp; Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(ii) a thinly-traded or nonpublic entity that uses the calculated value method shall disclose the reasons why it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the expected volatility of its share price, the appropriate industry sector index that it has selected, the reasons for selecting that particular index, and how it has calculated historical volatility using that index.&nbsp; The Company uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected contractual life of the share options or similar instruments as its expected volatility.&nbsp; If shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.&nbsp;Expected annual rate of quarterly dividends.&nbsp; An entity that uses a method that employs different dividend rates during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected dividends used and the weighted-average expected dividends.&nbsp; The expected dividend yield is based on the Company&#146;s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the expected term of the share options and similar instruments.&nbsp;Risk-free rate(s). An entity that uses a method that employs different risk-free rates shall disclose the range of risk-free rates used.&nbsp; The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the expected term of the share options and similar instruments.&nbsp;The Company&#146;s policy is to recognize compensation cost for awards with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.&nbsp;Equity Instruments Issued to Parties Other Than Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services&nbsp;The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under guidance of Sub-topic 505-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Sub-topic 505-50&#148;).&nbsp;Pursuant to ASC Section 505-50-30, all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.&nbsp; The measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur.&nbsp; If the Company is a newly formed corporation or shares of the Company are thinly traded the use of share prices established in the Company&#146;s most recent private placement memorandum (&#147;PPM&#148;), or weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.&nbsp;The fair value of share options and similar instruments is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model.&nbsp; The ranges of assumptions for inputs are as follows:&nbsp;Expected term of share options and similar instruments: Pursuant to Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(i) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the expected term of share options and similar instruments represents the period of time the options and similar instruments are expected to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual term of the instruments and holder&#146;s expected exercise behavior into the fair value (or calculated value) of the instruments.&nbsp; The Company uses historical data to estimate holder&#146;s expected exercise behavior.&nbsp; If the Company is a newly formed corporation or shares of the Company are thinly traded the contractual term of the share options and similar instruments is used as the expected term of share options and similar instruments as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.&nbsp;Expected volatility of the entity&#146;s shares and the method used to estimate it.&nbsp; Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(ii) a thinly-traded or nonpublic entity that uses the calculated value method shall disclose the reasons why it is not practicable for the Company to estimate the expected volatility of its share price, the appropriate industry sector index that it has selected, the reasons for selecting that particular index, and how it has calculated historical volatility using that index.&nbsp; The Company uses the average historical volatility of the comparable companies over the expected contractual life of the share options or similar instruments as its expected volatility.&nbsp; If shares of a company are thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market.&nbsp;Expected annual rate of quarterly dividends.&nbsp; An entity that uses a method that employs different dividend rates during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected dividends used and the weighted-average expected dividends.&nbsp; The expected dividend yield is based on the Company&#146;s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the expected term of the share options and similar instruments.&nbsp;Risk-free rate(s). An entity that uses a method that employs different risk-free rates shall disclose the range of risk-free rates used.&nbsp; The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the expected term of the share options and similar instruments.&nbsp;Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-25-7, if fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (no specific performance is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments), then, because of the elimination of any obligation on the part of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments, a measurement date has been reached. A grantor shall recognize the equity instruments when they are issued (in most cases, when the agreement is entered into). Whether the corresponding cost is an immediate expense or a prepaid asset (or whether the debit should be characterized as contra-equity under the requirements of paragraph 505-50-45-1) depends on the specific facts and circumstances. Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-45-1, a grantor may conclude that an asset (other than a note or a receivable) has been received in return for fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments that are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (and no specific performance is required by the grantee in order to retain those equity instruments). Such an asset shall not be displayed as contra-equity by the grantor of the equity instruments. The transferability (or lack thereof) of the equity instruments shall not affect the balance sheet display of the asset. This guidance is limited to transactions in which equity instruments are transferred to other than employees in exchange for goods or services. Section 505-50-30 provides guidance on the determination of the measurement date for transactions that are within the scope of this Subtopic.&nbsp;Pursuant to Paragraphs 505-50-25-8 and 505-50-25-9, an entity may grant fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable by the grantee only after a specified period of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee achieves specified performance conditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and in the same manner as if the entity had paid cash for the goods or services or used cash rebates as a sales discount instead of paying with, or using, the equity instruments. A recognized asset, expense, or sales discount shall not be reversed if a share option and similar instrument that the counterparty has the right to exercise expires unexercised.&nbsp;Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-30-S99-1, if the Company receives a right to receive future services in exchange for unvested, forfeitable equity instruments, those equity instruments are treated as unissued for accounting purposes until the future services are received (that is, the instruments are not considered issued until they vest). Consequently, there would be no recognition at the measurement date and no entry should be recorded.&nbsp;Software Development Costs&nbsp;The Company has adopted paragraph 985-20-05-01 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 985-20-05-01&#148;) for the costs of computer software to be sold or licensed.&nbsp; Paragraph 985-20-05-01 requires research and development costs incurred in the process of software development before establishment of technological feasibility being expensed as incurred and capitalization of software development costs incurred subsequent to establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the availability of the product for general release to customers.&nbsp; Systematic amortization of capitalized costs begins when a product is available for general release to customers and is computed on a product-by-product basis at a rate not less than straight-line basis over the product&#146;s remaining estimated economic life. To date, all costs have been accounted for as research and development costs and no software development cost has been capitalized.&nbsp;Income Tax Provision&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.&nbsp; Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.&nbsp; Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized.&nbsp; Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.&nbsp; The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period that includes the enactment date.&nbsp;The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Section 740-10-25&#148;). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.&nbsp; Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.&nbsp; The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty (50) percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.&nbsp; Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.&nbsp;The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.&nbsp;Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management&#146;s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.&nbsp;Uncertain Tax Positions&nbsp;The Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to the provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the reporting period ended December 31, 2013 or 2012.&nbsp;Net Income (Loss) perCommonShare&nbsp;Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. &nbsp;&nbsp;Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.&nbsp; Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements, stock options and warrants.&nbsp;The following table shows the potentially outstanding dilutive common shares excluded from the diluted net income (loss) per common share calculation as they were anti-dilutive, as adjusted by the Company&#146;s 1:1,500 reverse stock split adopted on March 6, 2014:&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash Flows Reporting&nbsp;The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (&#147;Indirect method&#148;) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.&nbsp; The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.&nbsp;Subsequent Events&nbsp;The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the&nbsp;financial statements are issued.&nbsp; Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.&nbsp;Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements&nbsp;In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, "Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent\'s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity." This ASU addresses the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The guidance outlines the events when cumulative translation adjustments should be released into net income and is intended by FASB to eliminate some disparity in current accounting practice. This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.&nbsp;In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-07,&#147;Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205): Liquidation Basis of Accounting.&#148;The amendments require an entity to prepare its financial statements using the liquidation basis of accounting when liquidation is imminent. Liquidation is imminent when the likelihood is remote that the entity will return from liquidation and either (a) a plan for liquidation is approved by the person or persons with the authority to make such a plan effective and the likelihood is remote that the execution of the plan will be blocked by other parties or (b) a plan for liquidation is being imposed by other forces (for example, involuntary bankruptcy). If a plan for liquidation was specified in the entity&#146;s governing documents from the entity&#146;s inception (for example, limited-life entities), the entity should apply the liquidation basis of accounting only if the approved plan for liquidation differs from the plan for liquidation that was specified at the entity&#146;s inception. The amendments require financial statements prepared using the liquidation basis of accounting to present relevant information about an entity&#146;s expected resources in liquidation by measuring and presenting assets at the amount of the expected cash proceeds from liquidation. The entity should include in its presentation of assets any items it had not previously recognized under U.S. GAAP but that it expects to either sell in liquidation or use in settling liabilities (for example, trademarks). The amendments are effective for entities that determine liquidation is imminent during annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and interim reporting periods therein. Entities should apply the requirements prospectively from the day that liquidation becomes imminent. Early adoption is permitted.&nbsp;Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.'

S"egxNOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&nbsp;History and Nature of Business&nbsp;Vystar Corporation (&#147;Vystar&#148;, the &#147;Company&#148;) is the creator and exclusive owner of the innovative technology to produce Vytex&#174; Natural Rubber Latex (&quot;NRL&quot;).  On September 13, 2012, the Company acquired SleepHealth, LLC and SleepHealth North Carolina, LLC (&#147;SleepHealth&#148;), privately-held sleep diagnostic companies headquartered in Monroe, Georgia.  SleepHealth provides sleep lab management services to physicians&#146; offices, specialty and multi-specialty clinics in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. In addition, on June 28, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of Kiron Clinical Sleep Lab, LLC (&#147;Kiron&#148;) a vertically integrated sleep diagnostic practice located in Durham, NC.  As a result of the acquisitions, Vystar Corporation is comprised of two segments, a Vytex Division, focused on expanding the licensing and utilization of its proprietary source natural rubber latex technology and a Clinical Sleep Diagnostics and Durable Medical Equipment Division focused on the sleep diagnostic and Durable Medical Equipment (&#147;DME&#148;) businesses.&nbsp;Basis of Presentation&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s (&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting Standards Codification.&nbsp;The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date of the filing of its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other than those events disclosed in Note 17, the Company is not aware of any other significant events that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to the filing of this report that would have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;Consolidation&nbsp;The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vystar, SleepHealth, and Kiron. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.&nbsp;Estimates&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures.&nbsp; Although these estimates are based on management&#146;s best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from these estimates. Examples include valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, provisions for bad debts, and fair values of share-based compensation and other equity issuances.&nbsp;Concentration of Credit Risk&nbsp;Certain financial instruments potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk.&nbsp; These financial instruments consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable.&nbsp; Cash held in operating accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, insurance limits.&nbsp; While we monitor cash balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail.&nbsp; To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our cash will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.&nbsp;Accounts Receivable&nbsp;Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances.&nbsp; Management provides for uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of the current status of individual accounts.&nbsp; Balances that are still outstanding after management has performed reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance and a credit to accounts receivable.&nbsp; As of December 31, 2013 and 2012,&nbsp;we have provided for uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings of $257,160and $33,745, respectively.&nbsp; We grant credit to our customers without requiring collateral.&nbsp; The amount of accounting loss for which we are at risk in these unsecured accounts receivable is limited to their carrying value.&nbsp;Vytex Division customers are located in both the United States and internationally. The SleepHealth Division customer base is located in three southeastern states: Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.  The Kiron Division&#146;s customer base is exclusively in North Carolina.&nbsp;Inventory&nbsp;Inventory consisting of Vytex NRL is stated at the lower of cost or market and cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.&nbsp;Property and Equipment&nbsp;Property and equipment is stated at cost.&nbsp; Depreciation is provided by the use of the straight-line and accelerated methods for financial and tax reporting purposes, respectively, over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally5 years.&nbsp;Intangible Assets&nbsp;Patents represent legal and other fees associated with the registration of patents.&nbsp; The Company has four issued patents with the United States Patent and Trade Office (USPTO) as well as four issued international PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) patents.&nbsp; Patents are carried at cost and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically20 years.&nbsp;The Company has trademark protection for &#147;Vystar&#148;, &#147;Vytex&#148;, and &#147;Created by Nature.&nbsp; Recreated by Science.&#148; Trademarks are carried at cost and since their estimated life is indeterminable, no amortization is recognized.&nbsp; Instead, they are evaluated annually for impairment.&nbsp;The Company acquired the trade name, SleepHealth. Trade names are carried at cost and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of five years.&nbsp;The Company acquired various physician relationships. Physician relationships are carried at cost and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three years.&nbsp;Impairment of Long-lived Assets&nbsp;Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.&nbsp; Fair value is determined based on discounted future net cash flows associated with the use of the asset.&nbsp;Goodwill Impairment&nbsp;Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. We utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine a reporting unit&#146;s fair value. The methodology used in estimating discounted cash flows is inherently complex and involves significant management assumptions, including expected revenue growth and increases in expenses, to determine an appropriate discount rate and cash flows. Estimated cash flows extend into the future and, by their nature, are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe. Factors that have and may significantly affect the estimates, and ultimately their carrying amount in our financials, include, among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures and technology, government regulation and changes in discount rates or market sector conditions. Significant changes in these assumptions could affect the need to record an impairment charge.&nbsp;Fair Value of Financial Instruments&nbsp;The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, lines of credit, shareholder notes payable, and long-term debt.&nbsp; The carrying values of all the Company&#146;s financial instruments approximate fair value because of their short maturities. In addition to the short maturities, the carrying amounts of our line of credit and shareholder notes payable approximate fair value because the interest rates at December 31, 2013 and 2012 approximate market interest rates for the respective borrowings.&nbsp;In specific circumstances, certain assets and liabilities are reported or disclosed at fair value.&nbsp; Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the Company's principal market for such transactions.&nbsp; If there is not an established principal market, fair value is derived from the most advantageous market.&nbsp;Valuation inputs are classified in the following hierarchy:&nbsp;&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable valuation inputs for the asset or liability, excluding Level 1 inputs.&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.&nbsp;Highest priority is given to Level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.&nbsp; Acceptable valuation techniques include the market approach, income approach, and cost approach.&nbsp; In some cases, more than one valuation technique is used.&nbsp;Income Taxes&nbsp;The Company follows the asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.&nbsp; Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for net operating loss carry-forwards that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences or carry-forwards are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.&nbsp; The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating losses and temporary differences become deductible.&nbsp; Income tax expense (benefit) is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2013, our accumulated net operating loss was approximately $15,300,000.&nbsp;In accordance with GAAP, a tax benefit arising from an uncertain tax position can only be recognized for financial reporting purposes if, and to the extent that, the position is more likely than not to be sustained in an audit by the applicable taxing authority.&nbsp; There were no material unrecognized tax benefits and related tax liabilities at December 31, 2013 and 2012. Penalties related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses. Interest relating to uncertain tax positions would be recorded as a component of interest expense.&nbsp;Loss Per Share&nbsp;The Company presents basic and diluted loss per share.&nbsp; Because the Company reported a net loss in 2013 and 2012, common stock equivalents, including stock options and warrants, were anti-dilutive; therefore, the amounts reported for basic and dilutive loss per share were the same.&nbsp; Excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share were options to purchase7,488,239and6,867,500shares of common stock for 2013 and 2012, respectively, as their effect would be anti-dilutive.&nbsp; Warrants to purchase14,788,714and12,857,926shares of common stock for 2013 and 2012, respectively, were also excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.  In addition, preferred stock convertible to 3,008,500 shares of common stock for 2013 and none for 2012 were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;The Vytex segment derives revenue from sales of or license fees of Vytex NRL raw material to manufacturers and distributors of rubber and rubber end products.&nbsp; Under both the direct and licensing agreement sales, the Vytex segment recognizes revenue at the time product is shipped and title passes to the customer. Revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) shipment or delivery has occurred; (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.&nbsp;SleepHealth bills its physician base of customers at the end of each month for services provided in that month and is not dependent on the physician collecting from insurance providers or from the patients. The SleepHealth segment recognizes revenue each month for sleep diagnostic services as services are provided.&nbsp;Kiron bills insurance providers and patients directly and is dependent on the practice&#146;s ability to collect from healthcare insurance providers and from its patients.  The Kiron segment recognizes revenue each month for sleep services as services are provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of Revenue&nbsp;For Vytex, cost of revenue consists primarily of product and freight costs. For SleepHealth, cost of revenue consists primarily of sleep technician labor costs and for Kiron, cost of revenue is primarily sleep technician labor costs and medical director fees.&nbsp;Research and Development&nbsp;Research and development costs are expensed when incurred.&nbsp; Research and development costs include all costs incurred related to the research, development and testing of the Company&#146;s process to produce Vytex NRL."

S'Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, &#8220;Presentation of Comprehensive Income&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2011-05&#8221;) which amends ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income.The objective of ASU 2011-05 is to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. The update will require entities to present items of net income, items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements, and entities will no longer be allowed to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders&#8217; equity. Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-12, &#8220;Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassification of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No. 2011-05&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2011-12&#8221;), defers changes in ASU 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. We adopted ASU 2011-05 as of July 1, 2012, by including a separate statement of comprehensive income. The adoption of the remaining guidance provided in ASU 2011-05 will result in a change to our current presentation of comprehensive income but will have no impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.There were no other accounting standards issued during the year that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.'

S'NOTE 2 &#8212; SUMMARY  OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESConsolidationThe  Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its  wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and  transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use  of EstimatesThe  preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management  to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of  contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.ReceivablesReceivables  include amounts due from certain third party payors and patient co-payments for  pharmacies owned by the Company, amounts due from Plan Sponsors under the  Company&#8217;s PBM agreements, amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for  rebates, and service fees resulting from the distribution of certain drugs  through retail pharmacies.Allowance  for Doubtful AccountsAllowances  for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer  receivable balances. The procedure for estimating the allowance for doubtful  accounts requires significant judgment and assumptions. The risk of collection  varies based upon the product, the payor (commercial health insurance,  government, and physician), the patient&#8217;s ability to pay the amounts not  reimbursed by the payor and the point of distribution (retail, national mail).  The Company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a variety  of factors including the age of the outstanding receivables and the historical  experience of collections, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in  certain cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The  Company periodically reviews the estimation process and makes changes to the  estimates as necessary. When it is deemed that a customer account is  uncollectible, that balance is written off against the existing  allowance.Allowance  for Contractual DiscountsThe  Company is reimbursed for the medications and services it sells by Plan  Sponsors. Revenues and related accounts receivable are recorded net of payor  contractual discounts to reflect the estimated net billable amounts for the  products and services delivered. The Company estimates the allowance for  contractual discounts, based on historical experience and in certain cases on a  customer-specific basis, given its interpretation of the contract terms or  applicable regulations. However, the reimbursement rates are often subject to  interpretation that could result in payments that differ from estimates.  Additionally, updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently,  necessitating the continual review and assessment of the estimation  process.InventoryInventory  is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the  first-in, first-out method. Inventory consists principally of purchased  prescription drugs for the Company&#8217;s traditional mail and specialty distribution  operations. Included in inventory is a reserve for expired  inventory.Property  and EquipmentProperty  and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated  useful lives of assets. The estimated useful lives of the Company&#8217;s assets are  as follows:Leasehold  improvements and leased assets are amortized using a straight-line basis over  the related lease term or estimated useful life of the assets, whichever is  less.  The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or  retired are removed from the accounts with the gain or loss, if applicable,  recorded in the statement of operations.  Maintenance and repair costs  are expensed as incurred.Costs  relating to the development of software for internal purposes are charged to  expense until technological feasibility is established in accordance with  Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 350,Intangibles   Goodwill and  Other(&#8220;ASC 350&#8221;). Thereafter, the remaining software production costs up  to the date placed into production are capitalized and included as Property and  Equipment.  Amortization of the capitalized amounts commences on the  date the asset is ready for its intended use and is calculated using the  straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the  software.      Amounts due to Plan SponsorsAmounts  due to Plan Sponsors primarily represent overpayments that will be paid back to  Plan Sponsors in Specialty Pharmacy Services. In addition, these payables  include the sharing of manufacturer&#8217;s rebates with Plan Sponsors in the  Traditional Pharmacy Services segment.RebatesManufacturers&#8217;  rebates are primarily part of the Company&#8217;s Specialty Pharmacy Services  segment.  Rebates are generally volume-based incentives that are  earned and recorded upon dispense.  Volume-based rebates are recorded  as a reduction of both inventory and cost of goods sold.The  Traditional Pharmacy Services segment also includes rebates earned on the PBM  portion of the business.  Rebates are recorded on historical PBM  results and trends and are revised on a regular basis depending on the Company&#8217;s  latest forecasts, as well as information received from rebate  sources.  Should actual results differ, adjustments will be recorded  in future earnings when the adjustment becomes known.  In some  instances, rebate payments are shared with the Company&#8217;s Plan  Sponsors.  PBM rebates earned by the Company are recorded as a  reduction of cost of goods sold.  PBM rebates shared with clients are  recorded as a reduction of revenue consistent with the sales incentive  provisions of ASC  Topic 605,Revenue Recognition(&#8220;ASC  605&#8221;).Revenue  RecognitionThe  Company generates revenue principally through the sale of prescription drugs,  which are dispensed either through a pharmacy participating in its pharmacy  network or a pharmacy owned by the Company. Revenue is generally derived under  fee-for-service agreements. Fee-for-service agreements include:  (i) specialty and mail service agreements, where the Company dispenses  prescription medications through its pharmacy facilities and (ii) PBM  agreements, where prescription medications are dispensed through pharmacies  participating in the Company&#8217;s retail pharmacy network as well as through its  traditional mail service facility.Accounting  Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Subtopic 605-25,Revenue Recognition:  Multiple-Element Arrangements(&#8220;ASC 605-25&#8221;), addresses situations in  which there are multiple deliverables under one revenue arrangement with a  customer and provides guidance in determining whether multiple deliverables  should be recognized separately or in combination.  The Company  provides a variety of therapies to patients.  For infusion related  therapies the Company frequently provides the multiple deliverables of drug  delivery and related nursing services.  After applying the criteria  from ASC 605-25, the Company concluded that separate units of accounting exist  in revenue arrangements where we provide multiple deliverables.Under  fee-for-service agreements in the Specialty Pharmacy Services segment, drug  revenue is recognized at the time the drug is shipped, and nursing revenue is  recognized on the date of service. At that point, the earnings process is  considered complete and the Company has substantially accomplished the terms of  its transaction.  In the Traditional Pharmacy Services segment,  revenue is recognized when the pharmacy services are reported to the  Company through the point of sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;) claims processing system and the drug  is dispensed to the member.Revenue  generated under PBM agreements is classified as either gross or net by the  Company based on whether it is acting as a principal or an agent in the  fulfillment of prescriptions through its retail pharmacy network. When the  Company independently has a contractual obligation to pay a network pharmacy  provider for benefits provided to its Plan Sponsors&#8217; members, and therefore is  the &#8220;primary obligor&#8221; as defined in ASC Topic 605,Revenue Recognition,the  Company includes payments (which include the drug ingredient cost) from these  Plan Sponsors as revenue and payments to the network pharmacy providers as cost  of revenue. These transactions require the Company to pay network pharmacy  providers, assume credit risk of Plan Sponsors and act as a principal. If the  Company merely acts as an agent, and consequently administers Plan Sponsors&#8217;  network pharmacy contracts, it does not have the primary obligation to pay the  network pharmacy and assume credit risk and as such records only the  administrative fees (and not the drug ingredient cost) as revenue.Cost  of RevenueCost of  revenue includes the costs of prescription medications, pharmacy claims, fees  paid to pharmacies, shipping and other direct and indirect costs associated with  pharmacy management and administration, claims processing operations, mail order  services and nursing services, offset by volume and prompt pay discounts  received from pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors and total  manufacturer rebates.Impairment  of Long Lived AssetsThe  Company evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate  the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets, including intangible  assets, may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of an asset may not  be recoverable. The measurement of possible impairment is based on the ability  to recover the balance of assets from expected future operating cash flows on an  undiscounted basis. Impairment losses, if any, are determined based on the  present value of the cash flows using discount rates that reflect the inherent  risk of the underlying business.GoodwillIn  accordance with ASC 350, the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an  annual basis and whenever events or circumstances exist that indicate that the  carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable.  The  impairment evaluation is based on a two-step process.  The first step  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including  goodwill.  If the first step indicates that the fair value of the  reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step must be  performed which determines the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill.  The measurement of possible impairment is based upon the comparison of the  implied fair value of reporting unit to its carrying value.Lease  AccountingThe  Company accounts for leasing transactions by recording rent expense on a  straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease, starting on the date it  gains possession of leased property. Lease terms are generally five years, with  many containing options to extend for periods ranging from one to five years.  The Company includes tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays received  from landlords and the effect of any rent escalation clauses as adjustments to  straight-line rent expense over the expected life of the lease.  The  Company does not enter into capital lease obligations due to certain covenant  requirements in our credit facility.Income  TaxesAs part  of the process of preparing the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements,  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in  which it operates. The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740,Income Taxes(&#8220;ASC  740&#8221;). ASC 740 requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting  for income taxes. Under this method, deferred taxes are determined by  calculating the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the  financial accounting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. A  valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when, in the opinion  of management, it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to  realize the benefit from its deferred tax assets.The  Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, as  prescribed by Federal tax laws and the tax laws of the state and local  jurisdictions in which it operates.  The Company&#8217;s uncertain tax  positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination and are  recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the recognition  threshold and measurement attributes of ASC 740 are met.  Interest and  penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax  expense.Disclosure  of Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe  Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents and  its line of credit. The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents and the line  of credit approximate fair value due to their fully liquid or short-term  nature.Accounting  for Stock-Based CompensationThe  Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation expense under the  provisions of ASC Topic 718,Compensation   Stock  Compensation(&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;).  At December 31, 2009, the  Company has one stock-based employee compensation plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) pursuant to  which incentive stock options (&#8220;ISOs&#8221;), non-qualified stock options (&#8220;NQSOs&#8221;),  restricted stock, performance units and performance share awards may be granted  to employees and non-employee directors. Option and stock awards are typically  settled by issuing authorized but unissued shares of the Company.The  Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the measurement  date using a binomial option-pricing model.  The fair value of the  award is amortized to expense on a straight line basis over the requisite  service period. The Company expenses restricted stock awards based on vesting  requirements, including time elapsed, market conditions and/or performance  conditions.  Because of these requirements, the weighted average  period for which the expense is recognized varies. Income  (Loss) Per ShareBasic  income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares  outstanding. Diluted income per share is based on the weighted average number of  shares outstanding, including common stock equivalents, and diluted (loss) per  share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding because the  impact of common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive (in thousands except  per share data):Employee  stock options and restricted stock awards of 3,681,109, 3,996,523 and 3,259,893  for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were excluded from the diluted net income  per share calculation because their effect would be anti-dilutive.Recent  Accounting PronouncementsIn June  2009, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-01,Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles(&#8220;ASC Topic 105&#8221;) which established the FASB Accounting  Standards Codification (the &#8220;Codification&#8221;) as the official single source of  authoritative GAAP.  All previously existing accounting standards were  superseded at that date.  All other accounting guidance not included  in the Codification will be considered non-authoritative.  The  Codification also includes relevant SEC guidance organized using the same  topical structure in separate sections within the Codification.Following  the Codification, FASB has stated that it will not issue new standards in the  form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force  Abstracts.  Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates  (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) that will serve to update the Codification, provide background  information about the guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the  changes to the Codification.The  Codification is not intended to change GAAP, but will change the way GAAP is  organized and presented.  The Codification was effective for the  Company&#8217;s third quarter 2009 financial statements and the principal impact is  limited to disclosures as all future references to authoritative accounting  literature will be referenced in accordance with the Codification.In  September 2009, FASB issued ASU 2009-13,Multiple Element Arrangements(&#8220;ASU 2009-13&#8221;), which is effective for fiscal years beginning on or  after June 15, 2010.  Early adoption is permitted.  If early  adoption is elected and the period of adoption is not the beginning of the  entity&#8217;s fiscal year, the entity will be required to apply the amendments of  this ASU retrospectively from the beginning of the entity&#8217;s fiscal  year.  An entity may elect, but will not be required, to adopt the  amendments in this ASU retrospectively for all prior periods. However, an entity  cannot apply the amendments in this ASU retrospectively to a period if it is  impracticable for it to report the change through retrospective application to  that prior period.ASU  2009-13 addresses the determination of when the individual deliverables included  in a multiple arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. ASU  2009-13 also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that  arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to  all deliverables using the relative selling price method. This standard must be  adopted by the Company no later than January 1, 2011. The Company is  currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this standard update will have on  its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.         In  2009, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 855,Subsequent Events(&#8220;ASC  855&#8221;), which was effective for interim and annual periods after June 15, 2009  and amended on February 24, 2010.

S'ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries in which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Foreign Currency TranslationNet foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) of$(0.1) million,$(0.6) millionand$(2.4) millionfor 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.For the Company&#8217;s international subsidiaries, the local currency is generally the functional currency.  Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using rates in effect at the balance sheet date while revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates.  The cumulative translation adjustment resulting from changes in exchange rates are included in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in total stockholders&#8217; equity.  Net foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) are included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, there was a substantial decrease with respect to certain functional currencies and their relation to the U.S. Dollar during the latter half of 2014 and throughout 2015, most notably the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, British pound and euro.The Company&#8217;s accumulated other comprehensive loss is comprised of three main components: (i) currency translation; (ii) derivatives; and (iii) gains and losses associated with the Company&#8217;s defined benefit plan in the United Kingdom.As ofDecember 31, 2015and 2014, the Company had$(47.7) millionand$(23.4) million, respectively, related to currency translation adjustments,$(0.2) millionand$(0.7) million, respectively, related to derivative transactions and$0.4 millionand$(0.5) million, respectively, related to pension activity in accumulated other comprehensive loss.Research and DevelopmentThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred.  Research and development costs of$2.8 million,$2.6 millionand$2.6 millionfor the years endedDecember 31, 2015,2014and2013, respectively, are included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.TaxationThe Company provides for estimated income taxes payable or refundable on current year income tax returns as well as the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards, based upon enacted tax laws and tax rates, and in accordance with FASB ASC 740,Income Taxes(&#8220;FASB ASC 740&#8221;).  FASB ASC 740 also requires that a valuation allowance be recorded against any deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized in the future.  The determination is based on the Company&#8217;s ability to generate future taxable income and, at times, is dependent on its ability to implement strategic tax initiatives to ensure full utilization of recorded deferred tax assets.  Should the Company not be able to implement the necessary tax strategies, it may need to record valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets, including those related to foreign income tax benefits.  Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets.In accordance with FASB ASC 740, tax benefits from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.  In addition, this recognition model includes a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in accordance with FASB ASC 740.  This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.The Company recognizes tax liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC 740 and adjusts these liabilities when judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available.  Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities.  These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.  While the Company believes the resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were appropriately accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 740, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.Refer to Note 10 for additional information regarding taxes on income.Equity-Based CompensationThe Company records expense for equity-based compensation awards, including restricted shares of common stock, performance awards, stock options and stock units based on the fair value recognition provisions contained in FASB ASC 718,Compensation   Stock Compensation(&#8220;FASB ASC 718&#8221;).  Expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.  The fair value of stock option awards is determined using an option pricing model.  Assumptions regarding volatility, expected term, dividend yield and risk-free rate are required for valuation of stock option awards.  Volatility and expected term assumptions are based on the Company&#8217;s historical experience.  The risk-free rate is based on a U.S. Treasury note with a maturity similar to the option award&#8217;s expected term.  The fair value of restricted stock, restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards is determined using the Company&#8217;s closing stock price on the award date.  The Company makes forfeiture rate assumptions in connection with the valuation of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards that could be different than actual experience.  As a general rule, all shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units are subject to service restrictions.  Additionally, the Company awards certain performance-based stock unit awards for a number of its key employees.  These awards are subject to performance and service restrictions, and contain cumulative financial targets for a designated performance period.  These awards have a threshold, target and maximum amount of shares that could be awarded based on the Company&#8217;s cumulative financial results.  Discussion of the Company&#8217;s application of FASB ASC 718 is described in Note 9.RevenuesRevenues include construction, engineering and installation revenues that are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs.  Revenues from change orders, extra work and variations in the scope of work are recognized when it is probable that they will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount can be reliably estimated.  Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools and equipment costs.  The Company expenses all pre-contract costs in the period these costs are incurred.  Since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates, which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts, recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion.  Revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.  If material, the effects of any changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred on a contract, a provision for the expected loss is recorded in the period in which the loss becomes evident.  Any revenue recognized is only to the extent costs have been recognized in the period.  Additionally, the Company expenses all costs for unpriced change orders in the period in which they are incurred.Revenues from the Company&#8217;s Energy Services segment are derived mainly from multiple engineering and construction type contracts, as well as maintenance contracts, under multi-year long-term Master Service Agreements and alliance contracts.  Businesses within the Company&#8217;s Energy Services segment enter into customer contracts that contain three principal types of pricing provisions: time and materials, cost plus fixed fee and fixed price.  Although the terms of these contracts vary, most are made pursuant to cost reimbursable contracts on a time and materials basis under which revenues are recorded based on costs incurred at agreed upon contractual rates.  Brinderson also performs services on a cost plus fixed fee basis under which revenues are recorded based upon costs incurred at agreed upon rates and a proportionate amount of the fixed fee or percentage stipulated in the contract.Earnings per ShareEarnings per share have been calculated using the following share information:The Company excluded324,804and318,059stock options and restricted and deferred stock units in 2015 and 2014, respectively, from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the Company&#8217;s common stock because of the reported net loss for the period.  The Company excluded164,014,164,014and318,026stock options in2015,2014and2013, respectively, from the diluted earnings per share calculations for the Company&#8217;s common stock because they were anti-dilutive as their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of common shares for each period.Classification of Current Assets and Current LiabilitiesThe Company includes in current assets and current liabilities certain amounts realizable and payable under construction contracts that may extend beyondoneyear.  The construction periods on projects undertaken by the Company generally range from less than one month to24months.At December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s balance in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings was$87.5 million, which increased$44.5 millionfrom December 31, 2014 primarily due to the timing of billing and advance deposits received on certain coatings projects at our Bayou Louisiana facility.  Correspondingly, the Company&#8217;s balance in prepaid expenses and other current assets was$67.0 millionat December 31, 2015, an increase of$25.0 millionfrom December 31, 2014, due primarily to the timing of advance deposits paid to suppliers on those same projects.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted CashThe Company classifies highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less as cash equivalents.  Recorded book values are reasonable estimates of fair value for cash and cash equivalents.  Restricted cash primarily consists of funds reserved for legal requirements, payments from certain customers placed in escrow in lieu of retention in case of potential issues regarding future job performance by the Company, or advance customer payments and compensating balances for bank undertakings in Europe.  Restricted cash related to operations is similar to retainage, and is therefore classified as a current asset, consistent with the Company&#8217;s policy on retainage.  Changes in restricted cash flows are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the restriction.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.  Actual cost is used to value raw materials and supplies.  Standard cost, which approximates actual cost, is used to value work-in-process, finished goods and construction materials.  Standard cost includes direct labor, raw materials and manufacturing overhead based on normal capacity.  For certain businesses within our Corrosion Protection segment, the Company uses actual costs or average costs for all classes of inventory.RetainageMany of the contracts under which the Company performs work contain retainage provisions.  Retainage refers to that portion of revenue earned by the Company but held for payment by the customer pending satisfactory completion of the project.  The Company generally invoices its customers periodically as work is completed.  Under ordinary circumstances, collection from municipalities is made within60to90days of billing.  In most cases,5%to15%of the contract value is withheld by the municipal owner pending satisfactory completion of the project.  Collections from other customers are generally made within30to45days of billing.  Unless reserved, the Company believes that all amounts retained by customers under such provisions are fully collectible.  Retainage on active contracts is classified as a current asset regardless of the term of the contract.  Retainage is generally collected within one year of the completion of a contract, although collection can extend beyond one year from time to time.  As ofDecember 31, 2015, retainage receivables aged greater than 365 days approximated10%of the total retainage balance and collectibility was assessed as described in the allowance for doubtful accounts section below.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsManagement makes estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable and retainage.  The Company records an allowance based on specific accounts to reduce receivables, including retainage, to the amount that is expected to be collected.  The specific allowances are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received.  After all reasonable attempts to collect the receivable or retainage have been explored, the account is written off against the allowance.  The Company also includes reserves related to certain accounts receivable that may be in litigation or dispute.Long-Lived AssetsProperty, plant and equipment and other identified intangibles (primarily customer relationships, patents and acquired technologies, trademarks, licenses and non-compete agreements) are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment, and, except for goodwill and certain trademarks, are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to the Company&#8217;s business model or changes in the Company&#8217;s capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from the Company&#8217;s estimates.  During 2015, no such changes were noted.  If the Company determines that the useful life of its property, plant and equipment or its identified intangible assets should be changed, the Company would depreciate or amortize the net book value in excess of the salvage value over its revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing or decreasing depreciation or amortization expense.Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangibles, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Such impairment tests are based on a comparison of undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset.  The estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, assumptions about expected future operating performance.  The Company&#8217;s estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance.  If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.Impairment Reviews - 2015As a result of the annual impairment assessment in accordance with FASB ASC 350,Intangibles - Goodwill and Other(&#8220;FASB ASC 350&#8221;) as of October 1, 2015, the CRTS reporting unit had a fair value below its carrying value, which caused the Company to review the financial performance of at risk asset groups within that reporting unit in accordance with FASB ASC 360,Property, Plant and Equipment(&#8220;FASB ASC 360&#8221;).  The results of CRTS are reported within the Corrosion Protection reportable segment.In response to contract losses in the Central California upstream energy market during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the Company&#8217;s subsequent decision to reduce exposure to the upstream market, the Company performed a market assessment of its energy-related businesses and concluded that sustained low oil prices will continue to create market challenges for the foreseeable future, including a continued reduction in spending by certain of its customers in 2016.  The loss of the contracts, coupled with the decision to downsize, caused the Company to review the financial performance of at risk asset groups within the reporting unit.  The results of Energy Services are reported within the Energy Services reportable segment.The assets of each asset group represent the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be determined independent of other groups of assets and liabilities.  The Company developed internal forward business plans under the guidance of local and regional leadership to determine the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from each of the at risk asset groups&#8217; long-lived assets.  Such were based on management&#8217;s best estimates considering the likelihood of various outcomes.  Based on the internal projections, the Company determined that the undiscounted expected future cash flows for all of the identified at risk asset groups exceeded the carrying value of the assets, and as such, no impairment to recorded long-lived assets was required.Impairment Review - September 30, 2014As part of the 2014 Restructuring, the Company evaluated the long-lived assets of its global operations affected by the restructuring initiative.  The affected reporting units were (i) the Bayou reporting unit (&#8220;Bayou Reporting Unit&#8221;); (ii) the European Sewer and Water Rehabilitation (&#8220;Europe&#8221;) reporting unit; and (iii) the Asia-Pacific Sewer and Water Rehabilitation (&#8220;Asia-Pacific&#8221;) reporting unit.  The results of the Bayou Reporting Unit and its related asset groups are reported within the Corrosion Protection reportable segment.  The results of Europe and Asia-Pacific and their related asset groups are reported within the Infrastructure Solutions reportable segment.The Company performed an asset impairment review as of September 30, 2014 for all of its at risk asset groups within each of the affected reporting units in accordance with FASB ASC 360.  The Company also engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of long-lived assets at these at risk asset groups.  Based upon the results of the analysis, the at risk asset groups with a fair value less than the carrying value of their respective assets included Bayou and Bayou Delta of the Bayou Reporting Unit; France of the Europe reporting unit; and Malaysia and India of the Asia-Pacific reporting unit.  Accordingly, the Company recorded a total impairment charge of$11.9 millionin the third quarter of 2014, which consisted of$10.9 millionrelated to Bayou,$0.4 millionrelated to Bayou Delta,$0.2 millionrelated to France,$0.3 millionrelated to Malaysia and$0.1 millionrelated to India.  The impairment charge was primarily recorded to cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Included within the impairment assessment were Bayou-related intangible assets such as tradenames and customer relationships that were also tested on an undiscounted cash flow basis.  For customer relationships, the undiscounted expected future cash flows were less than the carrying value; thus, the Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair value of customer relationships recorded at Bayou.  Based on the results of the valuation, the carrying amount of the customer relationship intangible asset at Bayou exceeded the fair value and resulted in a full impairment as of September 30, 2014.  Accordingly, the Company recorded a$10.9 millionimpairment charge in the third quarter of 2014.  The impairment charge was recorded to definite-lived intangible asset impairment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Annual Impairment Assessment - October 1, 2014As a result of the annual impairment assessment in accordance with FASB ASC 350,Intangibles Goodwill and Other(&#8220;FASB ASC 350&#8221;), the Fyfe Rehabilitation (&#8220;Fyfe&#8221;) reporting unit had a fair value below its carrying value, which caused the Company to review the financial performance of all at risk asset groups within that reporting unit in accordance with FASB ASC 360.  The results of Fyfe and its related asset groups are reported within the Infrastructure Solutions reportable segment.  Based on the results of the valuation, the carrying amount of the customer relationship intangible asset at Fyfe Latin America exceeded the fair value and resulted in a$1.2 millionimpairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2014.  The impairment charge was recorded to definite-lived intangible asset impairment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Impairment Review - December 31, 2014During the fourth quarter of 2014, certain reporting units operating in the energy sector experienced customer-driven delays, work order cancellations, and canceled sales opportunities as a result of declining crude oil prices since October 2014.  As a result, the Company evaluated the long-lived assets of its operations affected by these circumstances and performed an asset impairment review as of December 31, 2014 for all of its at risk asset groups within the CRTS and Bayou reporting units.  The results of these reporting units and their related asset groups are reported within the Corrosion Protection reportable segment.  Based on the internal projections, the Company determined that the undiscounted expected future cash flows for all of the identified at risk asset groups exceeded the carrying value of the assets, and as such, no impairment to recorded long-lived assets was required.The fair value estimates described above were determined using observable inputs and significant unobservable inputs, which are based on level 3 inputs as defined in Note 12.GoodwillUnder FASB ASC 350, the Company assesses recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable.  An impairment charge will be recognized to the extent that the implied fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.  Factors that could potentially trigger an impairment review include (but are not limited to):Whether during the annual impairment assessment or during a trigger-based impairment review, the Company determines the fair value of its reporting units and compares such fair value to the carrying value of those reporting units to determine if there are any indications of goodwill impairment.Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach with each method given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit.  Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, the Company believes the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value.  Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic outlooks, which are used to forecast future revenues, earnings and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit.  These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.The market approach estimates fair value by first determining earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) multiples for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit.  The EBITDA multiples for comparable companies are based upon current enterprise value.  The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a control premium.  The Company believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to its reporting units.The income approach is based on forecasted future (debt-free) cash flows that are discounted to present value using factors that consider timing and risk of future cash flows.  The Company believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit&#8217;s expected long-term operating cash flow performance.  Discounted cash flow projections are based on financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic outlooks, growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.  Estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes to business models, changes in the Company&#8217;s weighted average cost of capital, or changes in operating performance.The discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows is one of the most significant assumptions utilized under the income approach.  The Company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the weighted average cost of capital (&#8220;WACC&#8221;) for each individual reporting unit.  The WACC takes into account both the pre-tax cost of debt and cost of equity (a major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on twenty year U.S. Treasury bonds).  As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including market-based factors, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ.  Accordingly, the WACCs are adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company-specific risks associated with each reporting unit.Annual Impairment Assessment - October 1, 2015The Company had nine reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill at October 1, 2015 as follows:  North American Rehabilitation, Europe, Asia-Pacific, United Pipeline Systems, Bayou, Corrpro, CRTS, Fyfe and Energy Services.  During 2015, the Company acquired Schultz (see Note 1) and, for goodwill testing purposes, integrated Schultz into the previous Brinderson reporting unit to form the Energy Services reporting unit.Significant assumptions used in the Company&#8217;s October 2015 goodwill review included: (i) discount rates ranging from12.5%to15.0%; (ii) annual revenue growth rates generally ranging from1%to15%; (iii) gross margin declines in the short term related to certain reporting units in the energy sector, but sustained or slightly increased gross margins long term; (iv) peer group EBITDA multiples; and (v) terminal values for each reporting unit using a long-term growth rate of1.0%to3.5%.  If actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations, the Company could incur future impairment charges.During the Company&#8217;s assessment of its reporting units&#8217; fair values in relation to their respective carrying values, three reporting units had a fair value in excess of30%of their carrying value, four reporting units had a fair value in excess of10%, but below30%of their carrying value, one reporting unit had a fair value within10%percent of its carrying value, and one had a fair value below its carrying value.  The reporting unit with a fair value within10%of its carrying value was the Energy Services reporting unit.  The one reporting unit with a fair value below its carrying value was the CRTS reporting unit.  The total value of goodwill recorded at the impairment testing date for the Energy Services and CRTS reporting units was$80.2 millionand$14.4 million, respectively.For the Energy Services reporting unit, excess fair value in relation to its carrying value was7.5%.  The values derived from both the income approach and the market approach decreased from the October 1, 2014 annual goodwill impairment analysis, and the fair value in relation to its carrying value declined from the prior year due to softening in the upstream energy markets in Central California.  While activity in California&#8217;s downstream markets remains robust, the upstream market has experienced reduced spending by certain of the Company&#8217;s customers in 2015.  The fair value for Energy Services decreased$7.7 million, or4.1%, from the prior year analysis.  The 2015 analysis assumed a weighted average cost of capital of13.5%, compared14.0%in 2014, and a long-term growth rate of2.0%, which is consistent with the October 1, 2014 review.  The income approach analysis also included an annual revenue growth rate of approximately3.3%, which is lower than the prior year analysis; and gross margins were decreased slightly in the short term due to the softness in the upstream energy markets.  See below for the trigger-based impairment review conducted as of December 31, 2015.For the CRTS reporting unit, fair value in relation to its carrying value was negative30.0%.  The values derived from both the income approach and the market approach decreased from the December 31, 2014 impairment review (see below), and the fair value in relation to its carrying value declined from the prior year due to continued current uncertainty in the upstream oil markets, which caused customer-driven delays in the more profitable international offshore pipeline market and delayed or canceled sales opportunities in certain North American markets.  CRTS secured sizable project wins during 2014 and 2015; however, most were situated in international onshore and mining markets, which typically offer lower margin profiles.  Management expects this trend to continue into the foreseeable future.   The fair value for CRTS decreased$10.0 million, or21.8%, from the prior year analysis.  The impairment analysis assumed a weighted average cost of capital of13.5%and a long-term growth rate of3.0%.  The income approach analysis also included an annual revenue growth rate of approximately0.5%, which is lower than the3.8%growth rate assumed in the previous analysis.  As a result of failing Step 1, the Company performed Step 2 procedures, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value.  In estimating the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit, the Company assigns the fair value (as determined in Step 1) to the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.  Any excess of the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit over its implied fair value is recorded as impairment.  Based on this analysis, the Company determined that recorded goodwill at CRTS was impaired by$10.0 million, which was recorded to &#8220;Goodwill impairment&#8221; in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2015.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had remaining CRTS goodwill of$4.4 million.  Projected cash flows were based, in part, on maintaining a presence in the higher-margin, international offshore pipeline market and the Company&#8217;s ability to expand its technology to other applications.  If these assumptions do not materialize in a manner consistent with the Company&#8217;s expectations, there is risk of impairment to recorded goodwill.Impairment Review - December 31, 2015In response to contract losses in the Central California upstream energy market during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the Company&#8217;s subsequent decision to reduce exposure to the upstream market, the Company performed a market assessment of its energy-related businesses and concluded that sustained low oil prices will continue to create market challenges for the foreseeable future, including a continued reduction in spending by certain of its customers in 2016.  The loss of the contracts, coupled with the decision to downsize, caused the Company to review the goodwill of its operations affected by these circumstances and determined that a triggering event had occurred.  As such, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment review for its Energy Services reporting unit as of December 31, 2015.  In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 350, the Company determined the fair value of the affected reporting unit and it was found to be less than the carrying value.For the Energy Services reporting unit, fair value in relation to its carrying value was negative27.6%.  The values derived from the income approach and the market approach decreased29.0%and27.6%, respectively, from the October 1, 2015 goodwill impairment analysis.  The Company&#8217;s expected future cash flows in 2016 and beyond were lowered primarily due to the loss oftwokey contracts in the Central California upstream energy market in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The impairment analysis assumed a weighted average cost of capital of13.0%, compared13.5%in the October 1, 2015 review, and a long-term growth rate of2.0%, which is consistent with the October 1, 2015 review.  The income approach analysis included a year 1 decrease in revenue of approximately$90 millionand an annual revenue growth rate thereafter of approximately2.6%, which was slightly lower than the3.3%annual growth in the previous analysis.  Average gross margins were generally consistent between the two analyses; however, operating expenses declined in a manner consistent with revenues as a result of the benefits achieved from the 2016 Restructuring.  As a result of failing Step 1, the Company performed Step 2 procedures, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value.  In estimating the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit, the Company assigns the fair value (as determined in Step1) to the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.  Any excess of the carrying value of goodwill of the reporting unit over its implied fair value is recorded as impairment.  Based on this analysis, the Company determined that recorded goodwill at Energy Services was impaired by$33.5 million, which was recorded to &#8220;Goodwill impairment&#8221; in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2015.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had remaining Energy Services goodwill of$46.7 million.  Projected cash flows were based on maintaining a smaller but profitable presence in the upstream energy market and continued strength in the Central California downstream energy market.  Also included in the projected cash flows were certain cost savings expected to be achieved through the 2016 Restructuring.  If these assumptions do not materialize in a manner consistent with the Company&#8217;s expectations, there is risk of impairment to recorded goodwill.Impairment Review - September 30, 2014As a result of the 2014 Restructuring, the Company evaluated the goodwill of its global operations affected by the restructuring initiative and determined that a triggering event had occurred.  As such, the Company performed a goodwill impairment review for each affected reporting unit as of September 30, 2014.  The Company&#8217;s reporting units adversely affected by the 2014 Restructuring were Bayou, Europe and Asia-Pacific.  In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 350, the Company determined the fair value of its reporting units and compared such fair value to the carrying value of those reporting units.  For all three reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value, and as such, no impairment to recorded goodwill was required.Annual Impairment Assessment - October 1, 2014As a result of the annual impairment assessment in accordance with FASB ASC 350, the Fyfe reporting unit had a fair value less than its carrying value.  Longer-term expectations for the Fyfe businesses, primarily in North America, were lowered in 2014 because investments in operational leadership and business development yielded slower than expected growth.  In previous years, the Company expected bidding activity would increase in 2014 and result in new contract wins that would commence in 2014 and 2015.  While stability was restored and improvements were made in 2014, the ability to sustain new order intake and improve gross profits did not materialize as rapidly as expected.  As a result of failing Step 1, the Company performed Step 2 procedures, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value.Based on this analysis, the Company determined that recorded goodwill at Fyfe was impaired by$16.1 million, which was recorded to &#8220;Goodwill impairment&#8221; in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2014.  As of December 31, 2014, the Company had remaining Fyfe goodwill of$50.2 million.Future cash flows included increased revenue projections related to growth in the pipeline market, specifically industrial and municipal pipelines.  Delays in those growth projections could have a material negative affect on Fyfe&#8217;s projected long-term cash flows.  Also included in the projected cash flows were certain cost savings expected to be achieved through the 2014 Restructuring.  If any of these assumptions do not materialize in a manner consistent with the Company&#8217;s expectations, there is risk of impairment to recorded goodwill.Impairment Review - December 31, 2014During the fourth quarter of 2014, certain reporting units operating in the energy sector experienced customer-driven delays, work order cancellations, and canceled sales opportunities as a result of declining crude oil prices since October 2014.  The Company evaluated the goodwill of its operations affected by these circumstances and determined that a triggering event had occurred.  As such, the Company performed a goodwill impairment review for its Bayou and CRTS reporting units as of December 31, 2014.  In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 350, the Company determined the fair value of its affected reporting units and compared such fair value to the carrying value of those reporting units.  For both reporting units, carrying value exceeded fair value.For the Bayou reporting unit, uncertainty in the upstream oil markets, which caused work order cancellations and canceled sales opportunities in North America for the Bayou Canada and CCSI asset groups, affected the Company&#8217;s expected future cash flows in 2015 and 2016.  As a result of failing Step 1, the Company performed Step 2 procedures, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value.  Based on this analysis, the Company determined that Bayou&#8217;s goodwill was fully impaired, and as such, recorded a$29.7 millioncharge to &#8220;Goodwill impairment&#8221; in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2014.  As of December 31, 2014, there wasnorecorded goodwill at Bayou.For the CRTS reporting unit, expected future cash flows were impacted by the uncertainty in the upstream oil markets, which caused customer-driven delays in the more profitable international offshore pipeline market and delayed or canceled sales opportunities in certain North American markets.  As a result of failing Step 1, the Company performed Step 2 procedures, which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value.  Based on this analysis, the Company determined that recorded goodwill at CRTS was impaired by$5.7 million, which was recorded to &#8220;Goodwill impairment&#8221; in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2014.  As of December 31, 2014, the Company had remaining CRTS goodwill of$14.4 million.  See subsequent impairment review performed as of October 1, 2015 above.Investments in Affiliated CompaniesOn March 31, 2014, the Company sold its forty-nine percent (49%) interest in Bayou Coating to Stupp, the holder of the remaining fifty-one percent (51%) interest in Bayou Coating.  Stupp purchased the interest by exercising an existing option to acquire the Company&#8217;s interest in Bayou Coating at a purchase price equal to$9.1 million.  The Company had previously received an indication from Stupp of its intent to exercise such option and, in the second quarter of 2013 in connection with such indication, the Company recognized a non-cash charge of$2.7 million($1.8 millionafter tax) related to the goodwill allocated to the joint venture as part of the purchase price accounting associated with the 2009 acquisition of Bayou.  The non-cash charge represented the Company&#8217;s then current estimate of the difference between the carrying value of the investment on the balance sheet and the amount the Company would receive in connection with the exercise.  During the first quarter of 2014, the difference between the Company&#8217;s recorded gross equity in earnings of affiliated companies of$1.2 millionand the final equity distribution settlement of$0.7 millionresulted in a loss of$0.5 millionthat is recorded in other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations.Prior to March 2014, the Company held a fifty-nine percent (59%) equity interest in Bayou Delta through which the Company offers pipe jointing and other services for the steel-coated pipe industry.  The remaining forty-one percent (41%) was held by Bayou Coating.  On March 31, 2014, the Company acquired this forty-one percent (41%) interest from Bayou Coating by exercising its existing option at a purchase price equal to$0.6 million.  As a result, Bayou Delta is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.In June 2013, the Company sold its fifty percent (50%) interest in Insituform-Germany to Aarsleff.  Insituform-Germany, a company that was jointly owned by Aegion and Aarsleff, is active in the business of no-dig pipe rehabilitation in Germany, Slovakia and Hungary.  The sale price was&#8364;14 million, approximately$18.3 million.  The sale resulted in a gain on the sale of approximately$11.3 million(net of$0.5 millionof transaction expenses) recorded in other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations.  In connection with the sale, Insituform-Germany also entered into a tube supply agreement with the Company whereby Insituform-Germany was obligated to purchase on an annual basis at least GBP2.3 million, approximately$3.6 million, of felt cured-in-place pipe (&#8220;CIPP&#8221;) liners during the two-year period from June 26, 2013 to June 30, 2015.  The parties did not renew the tube supply agreement upon expiration.Investments in entities in which the Company does not have control or is not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, and for which the Company has 20% to 50% ownership or has the ability to exert significant influence, are accounted for by the equity method.  AtDecember 31, 2015and2014, the Company did not own any investments in affiliated companies.Net income presented below for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 includes Bayou Coating&#8217;s previously held forty-one percent (41%) interest in Bayou Delta, which is eliminated for purposes of determining the Company&#8217;s equity in earnings of affiliated companies because Bayou Delta was consolidated in the Company&#8217;s financial statements as a result of its additional ownership through another Company subsidiary.The Company did not maintain any investments in affiliated companies during the year endedDecember 31, 2015.The Company&#8217;s equity in earnings of affiliated companies for all periods presented below includes acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense and is net of income taxes associated with these earnings.  Financial data for investments in affiliated companies are summarized in the following table (in thousands):_____________________(1)    Includes the results of Bayou Coating through the date of its sale in March 2014.(2)    Includes the results of Insituform-Germany through the date of its sale in June 2013.Investments in Variable Interest EntitiesThe Company evaluates all transactions and relationships with variable interest entities (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the entities in accordance with FASB ASC 810,Consolidation.The Company&#8217;s overall methodology for evaluating transactions and relationships under the VIE requirements includes the following two steps:In performing the first step, the significant factors and judgments that the Company considers in making the determination as to whether an entity is a VIE include:If the Company identifies a VIE based on the above considerations, it then performs the second step and evaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE by considering the following significant factors and judgments:Based on its evaluation of the above factors and judgments, as ofDecember 31, 2015, the Company consolidated any VIEs in which it was the primary beneficiary.Financial data for consolidated variable interest entities are summarized in the following tables (in thousands):The Company&#8217;s non-consolidated variable interest entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and discussed further under &#8220;Investments in Affiliated Companies&#8221; above.Newly Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  The standard is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its financial condition and results of operations.In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, alongwith any related valuation allowance, to be presented as non-current within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, but early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s presentation of its financial condition.In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires acquirers in a business combination to recognize measurement period adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  This is a change from the previous requirement that the adjustments be recorded retrospectively.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s presentation of its consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance that amends existing requirements regarding the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of a deferred charge.  It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s presentation of its financial condition.In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance that requires management to assess the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosures in certain circumstances.  The standard is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s presentation of its consolidated financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance that supersedes revenue recognition requirements regarding contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or for the transfer of non-financial assets.  Under the new guidance, entities are required to recognize revenue in order to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The guidance provides a five-step analysis to be performed on transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized.  This new guidance is effective retroactively in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its financial condition and results of operations.'

S'Note 2 - summary of significant accounting\rpolicies Basis of Presentation - Unaudited Interim\rFinancial Information The accompanying unaudited interim financial\rstatements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\rof America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;) for interim financial information, and with the rules and regulations of the United States\rSecurities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include\rall of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim financial\rstatements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management,\rnecessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim results are not necessarily\rindicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in\rconjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2014 and notes thereto contained in the\rinformation as part of the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission\ron March 31, 2015. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in\rconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates\rand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\rat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting estimates are estimates\rfor which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly\runcertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or\roperating performance is material. The Company&#146;s critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements\rwere:  These significant accounting estimates or\rassumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and\rcertain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value. Management bases its estimates on historical\rexperience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole\runder the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities\rthat are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates the key factors\rand assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical\rexperience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10\rof the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37\rof the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to measure the fair value of its financial\rinstruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted\rin the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and\rcomparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which\rprioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into Six (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy\rgives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest\rpriority to unobservable inputs. The Six (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:  Financial assets are considered Level 3 when\rtheir fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one\rsignificant model assumption or input is unobservable. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest\rpriority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable\rinputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the\rcategorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. The carrying amount of the Company&#146;s\rfinancial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair\rvalue because of the short maturity of those instruments. Transactions involving related parties cannot\rbe presumed to be carried out on an arm&#146;s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings\rmay not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions\rwere consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm&#146;s-length transactions unless such representations can be\rsubstantiated. The Company includes fair value information\rin the notes to financial statements when the fair value of its financial instruments is different from the book value. When the\rbook value approximates fair value, no additional disclosure is made. Valuation of Derivatives The Company evaluates its convertible instruments,\roptions, warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives\rto be separately accounted for under ASC Topic 815, &#147;Derivatives and Hedging.&#148; The result of this accounting treatment\ris that the fair value of the derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date. The change in fair value is recorded in\rthe statement of operations as other income (expense). Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument\ris marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Equity instruments that are\rinitially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815 are reclassified to liabilities at\rthe fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. We analyzed the derivative financial instruments in accordance\rwith ASC 815. The objective is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument is indexed to\ran entity&#146;s own stock. This determination is needed for a scope exception which would enable a derivative instrument to be\raccounted for under the accrual method. The classification of a non-derivative instrument that falls within the scope of ASC 815-40-05\r&#147;Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company&#146;s Own Stock&#148;\ralso hinges on whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&#146;s own stock. A non-derivative instrument that is not indexed\rto an entity&#146;s own stock cannot be classified as equity and must be accounted for as a liability. There is a two-step approach\rin determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity&#146;s own stock. First, the instrument&#146;s\rcontingent exercise provisions, if any, must be evaluated, followed by an evaluation of the instrument&#146;s settlement provisions.\rThe Company utilized multinomial lattice models that value the derivative liability based on a probability weighted discounted\rcash flow model. The Company utilized the fair value standard set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, defined as\rthe amount at which the assets (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between\rwilling parties, that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The derivative liabilities result in a reduction\rof the initial carrying amount (as unamortized discount) of the Convertible Notes. This derivative liability is marked-to-market\reach quarter with the change in fair value recorded in the income statement. Unamortized discount is amortized to interest expense\rusing the effective interest method over the life of the Convertible Note. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company includes fair value information\rin the notes to financial statements when the fair value of its financial instruments is different from the book value. When the\rbook value approximates fair value, no additional disclosure is made. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments\rwith a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for\rDoubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced\ramount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company follows paragraph 310-10-50-9 of the FASB Accounting Standards\rCodification to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers\rand adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer&#146;s current credit worthiness, as determined by the review\rof their current credit information; and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical write-off experience,\rcustomer specific facts and general economic conditions that may affect a client&#146;s ability to pay. Pursuant to paragraph 310-10-50-2 of the FASB\rAccounting Standards Codification account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been\rexhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company has adopted paragraph 310-10-50-6 of the FASB Accounting\rStandards Codification and determine when receivables are past due or delinquent based on how recently payments have been received. Outstanding account balances are reviewed\rindividually for collectability. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company&#146;s best estimate of the amount of probable\rcredit losses in the Company&#146;s existing accounts receivable. Bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses,\rif any. There was no allowance for doubtful accounts\rat December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet\rcredit exposure to its customers at December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014. Furniture and Fixtures Furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost.\rExpenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.\rDepreciation is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective estimated residual values) over\rthe estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:  Upon sale or retirement, the related cost\rand accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the statements of operations. Related Parties The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the\rFASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the Related\rparties include: a. affiliates of the Company (&#147;Affiliate&#148; means, with respect to any specified Person, any other Person\rthat, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such\rPerson, as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act); b. entities for which investments in\rtheir equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection\rof Section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c. trusts for the benefit of employees,\rsuch as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the\rCompany; e. management of the Company; f. other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly\rinfluence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented\rfrom fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g. other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating\rpolicies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly\rinfluence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate\rinterests. The financial statements shall include disclosures\rof material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the\rordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of financial statements\ris not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description\rof the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for\rwhich income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions\ron the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented\rand the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. a amounts\rdue from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner\rof settlement. Commitments and contingencies The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the\rFASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the\rfinancial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future\revents occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise\rof judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims\rthat may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims\ras well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates\rthat it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated\rliability would be accrued in the Company&#146;s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss\rcontingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent\rliability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally\rnot disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Revenue Recognition The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1\rof the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable\rand earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive\revidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii)\rthe sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company derives its revenues from sales\rcontracts with its customer with revenues being generated upon rendering of services. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement is\rdemonstrated via invoice; service is considered provided when the service is delivered to the customers; and the sales price to\rthe customer is fixed upon acceptance of the purchase order and there is no separate sales rebate, discount, or volume incentive. Equity Instruments Issued to Parties\rOther Than Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services The Company accounts for equity instruments\rissued to parties other than employees for acquiring goods or services under the guidance of Sub-topic 505-50 of the FASB Accounting\rStandards Codification (&#147;Sub-topic 505-50&#148;). Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-25-7, if\rfully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods\ror services (no specific performance is required by the grantee to retain those equity instruments), then, because of the elimination\rof any obligation on the part of the counterparty to earn the equity instruments, a measurement date has been reached. A grantor\rshall recognize the equity instruments when they are issued (in most cases, when the agreement is entered into). Whether the corresponding\rcost is an immediate expense or a prepaid asset (or whether the debit should be characterized as contra-equity under the requirements\rof paragraph 505-50-45-1) depends on the specific facts and circumstances. Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-45-1, a grantor may\rconclude that an asset (other than a note or a receivable) has been received in return for fully vested, non-forfeitable equity\rinstruments that are issued at the date the grantor and grantee enter into an agreement for goods or services (and no specific\rperformance is required by the grantee in order to retain those equity instruments). Such an asset shall not be displayed as contra-equity\rby the grantor of the equity instruments. The transferability (or lack thereof) of the equity instruments shall not affect the\rbalance sheet display of the asset. This guidance is limited to transactions in which equity instruments are transferred to other\rthan employees in exchange for goods or services. Pursuant to Paragraphs 505-50-25-8 and 505-50-25-9,\ran entity may grant fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments that are exercisable by the grantee only after a specified\rperiod of time if the terms of the agreement provide for earlier exercisability if the grantee achieves specified performance\rconditions. Any measured cost of the transaction shall be recognized in the same period(s) and in the same manner as if the entity\rhad paid cash for the goods or services or used cash rebates as a sales discount instead of paying with, or using, the equity\rinstruments. A recognized asset, expense, or sales discount shall not be reversed if a stock option that the counterparty has\rthe right to exercise expires unexercised. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 505-50-30-2 and\r505-50-30-11 share-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received\ror the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The issuer shall measure the fair value\rof the equity instruments in these transactions using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of the\rfollowing dates, referred to as the measurement date: (a) The date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to\rearn the equity instruments is reached (a performance commitment); or (b) The date at which the counterparty&#146;s performance\ris complete. If the Company&#146;s common shares are traded in one of the national exchanges the grant-date share price of the\rCompany&#146;s common stock will be used to measure the fair value of the common shares issued, however, if the Company&#146;s\rcommon shares are thinly traded the use of share prices established in the Company&#146;s most recent private placement memorandum\r(&#147;PPM&#148;), or weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate than the use of daily price observations\ras such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and asked quotes and lack of consistent trading\rin the market. Pursuant to ASC Paragraph 718-10-55-21 if\ran observable market price is not available for a share option or similar instrument with the same or similar terms and conditions,\ran entity shall estimate the fair value of that instrument using a valuation technique or model that meets the requirements in\rparagraph 718-10-55-11 and takes into account, at a minimum, all of the following factors:   Pursuant to ASC paragraph 505-50-S99-1, if\rthe Company receives a right to receive future services in exchange for unvested, forfeitable equity instruments, those equity\rinstruments are treated as unissued for accounting purposes until the future services are received (that is, the instruments are\rnot considered issued until they vest). Consequently, there would be no recognition at the measurement date and no entry should\rbe recorded. Stock-Based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation\rin accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, &#147;Compensation &#150; Stock Compensation.&#148; FASB ASC Topic 718 requires\rcompanies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the\rexpense over the employee&#146;s requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statement of operations the grant-date\rfair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees. There were 6,000,000 options\routstanding as of December 31, 2015. Research and Development The Company follows paragraph 730-10-25-1\rof the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2&#147;Accounting\rfor Research and Development Costs&#148;) and paragraph 730-20-25-11 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (formerly\rStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 68&#147;Research and Development Arrangements&#148;) for research and\rdevelopment costs. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily\rof remuneration for research and development staff, depreciation and maintenance expenses of research and development equipment,\rmaterial and testing costs for research and development as well as research and development arrangements with unrelated third\rparty research and development institutions. Deferred Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision The Company accounts for income taxes under\rSection 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities\rfor the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this\rmethod, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets\rand liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax\rassets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will\rnot be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured\rusing enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to\rbe recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements\rof operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company adopted the provisions of paragraph\r740-10-25-13 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 addresses the determination of whether tax\rbenefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13,\rthe Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position\rwill be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized\rin the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty\rpercent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition,\rclassification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The estimated future tax effects of temporary\rdifferences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit\rcarry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance\rsheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation\rof the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition,\rthe Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management&#146;s\ropinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies\rfrom estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary. Tax years that remain subject to examination\rby major tax jurisdictions The Company discloses tax years that remain\rsubject to examination by major tax jurisdictions pursuant to the ASC Paragraph 740-10-50-15. Earnings per Share Earnings Per Share (&#147;EPS&#148;) is\rthe amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings\ror loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC\rParagraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the\rnumerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to\rcommon stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not\rpaid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing\roperations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar\rto the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that\rwould have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential\rdilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21\rthrough 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint\rof the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting\rentity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35\rthrough 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include\rnon-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260-10-55-23).\rAnti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the\rtreasury stock method: a. Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance,\rif later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase\rcommon stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c. The\rincremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall\rbe included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation. The computation of basic and diluted loss\rper share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 excludes the common stock equivalents of the following potentially dilutive\rsecurities because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive: &#9679;   Stock Warrants (Exercise\rprice - $0.2625/share) &#150; 850,000 common stock equivalents&#9679;   Convertible Debt\r(Exercise price - $0.2625/share) &#150; 1,804,515 common stock equivalents There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding for the reporting\ryear ended December 31, 2014. Cash Flows Reporting The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24\rof the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether\rthey stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect\ror reconciliation method (&#147;Indirect method&#148;) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification\rto report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities\rby removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future\roperating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts\rand payments. The Company reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange\rrate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a\rseparate item in the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information\rabout investing and financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1\rof the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Subsequent Events The Company follows the guidance in Section\r855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent\revents through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification,\rthe Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through\rfiling them on EDGAR. Recently issued accounting pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting\rStandards Update No. 2014-09 &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#148; (&#147;ASU 2014-09&#148;) This guidance amends the existing FASB Accounting\rStandards Codification, creating a new Topic 606,Revenue from Contracts with Customer.The core principle of the guidance\ris that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\rreflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity\rshould apply the following steps:  The ASU also provides guidance on disclosures\rthat should be provided to enable financial statement users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue\rrecognition and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Qualitative and quantitative information is required about the\rfollowing:  ASU 2014-09 is effective for periods beginning\rafter December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period for all public entities. Early application\ris not permitted. In June 2014, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting\rStandards Update No. 2014-12 &#147;Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718):Accounting for Share-Based Payments\rWhen the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&#148; (&#147;ASU\r2014-12&#148;). The amendments clarify the proper method of\raccounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite\rservice period. The Update requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite\rservice period be treated as a performance condition. The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date\rfair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance\rtarget will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service\rhas already been rendered. The amendments in this Update are effective\rfor annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted\rand the Company has elected to implement the guidance in its quarter ended September 30, 2014. In August 2014, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting\rStandards Update No. 2014-15 &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties\rabout an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (&#147;ASU 2014-15&#148;). In connection with preparing financial statements\rfor each annual and interim reporting period, an entity&#146;s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events,\rconsidered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within\rone year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements\rare available to be issued when applicable). Management&#146;s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that\rare known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements\rare available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern exists\rwhen relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable\rto meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available\rto be issued). The term probable is used consistently with its use in Topic 450, Contingencies. When management identifies conditions or events\rthat raise substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern, management should consider whether\rits plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. The mitigating\reffect of management&#146;s plans should be considered only to the extent that (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively\rimplemented and, if so, (2) it is probable that the plans will mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt\rabout the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. If conditions or events raise substantial\rdoubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration\rof management&#146;s plans, the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand\rall of the following (or refer to similar information disclosed elsewhere in the footnotes):  If conditions or events raise substantial\rdoubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern, and substantial doubt is not alleviated after consideration\rof management&#146;s plans, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating that there is substantial doubt about\rthe entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued\r(or available to be issued). Additionally, the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial statements\rto understand all of the following:  The amendments in this Update are effective\rfor the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application\ris permitted. In November 2014, the FASB issued the FASB\rAccounting Standards Update No. 2014-16 &#147;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815):Determining Whether the Host Contract\rin a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity&#148; (&#147;ASU 2014-16&#148;).The amendments in ASU No. 2014-16 clarify that an entity must take into account all relevant terms and features when reviewing\rthe nature of the host contract. Additionally, the amendments state that no one term or feature would define the host contract&#146;s\reconomic characteristics and risks. Instead, the economic characteristics and risks of the hybrid financial instrument as a whole\rwould determine the nature of the host contract. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for\rfiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption, including adoption\rin an interim period, is permitted. In January 2015, the FASB issued the FASB\rAccounting Standards Update No. 2015-01 &#147;Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20):Simplifying\rIncome Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items&#148; (&#147;ASU 2015-01&#148;).This Update\reliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items and the requirements in Subtopic 225-20 for reporting entities to separately\rclassify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal\ryears, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted provided\rthat the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments in this Update are effective\rfor public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,\r2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. In August, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.The amendment in this ASU defers the\reffective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and\rcertain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2017,\rincluding interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting\rperiods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.\r2015-17,Income Taxes (Topic 740). &#145;The amendments in ASU 2015-17 eliminates the current requirement for organizations\rto present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations\rwill be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. ASU 2015-17 is effective for public business\rentities for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those\rannual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all\rperiods presented. Management does not believe that any other\rrecently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying\rfinancial statements.'

S'1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:&nbsp;Nature of OperationsMTS Systems Corporation is a leading global supplier of high performance test systems and position sensors. The Company&#x2019;s hardware and software solutions help customers accelerate and improve their design, development, and manufacturing processes and are used for determining the mechanical behavior of materials, products, and structures. MTS&#x2019; position sensors provide controls for a variety of industrial and vehicular applications.&nbsp;Fiscal YearThe Company&#x2019;s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30. The Company&#x2019;s fiscal years ended September 29, 2012, October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010 consisted of52weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;ConsolidationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of MTS Systems Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the "Company"). Significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.&nbsp;Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue on a sales arrangement when it is realized or realizable and earned, which occurs when all of the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery and title transfer has occurred or services have been rendered; the sales price is fixed and determinable; collectability is reasonably assured; and all significant obligations to the customer have been fulfilled.&nbsp;Orders that are manufactured and delivered in less thansixmonths with routine installations and no special acceptance protocols may contain multiple elements for revenue recognition purposes. The Company considers each deliverable that provides value to the customer on a standalone basis a separable element. Separable elements in these arrangements may include the design and manufacture of hardware and essential software, installation services, training and/or post contract software maintenance and support. The Company initially allocates consideration to each separable element using the relative selling price method. Selling prices are determined by the Company based on either vendor-specific objective evidence (&#x201C;VSOE&#x201D;) (the actual selling prices of similar products and services sold on a standalone basis) or, in the absence of VSOE, the Company&#x2019;s best estimate of the selling price. Factors considered by the Company in determining estimated selling prices for applicable elements generally include overall economic conditions, customer demand, costs incurred by the Company to provide the deliverable, as well as the Company&#x2019;s historical pricing practices. Under these arrangements, revenue associated with each delivered element is recognized in an amount equal to the lesser of the consideration initially allocated to the delivered element or the amount for which payment is not deemed contingent upon future delivery of other elements in the arrangement. Under arrangements where special acceptance protocols exist, installation services and training are not considered separable. Accordingly, revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized upon the completion of installation, training and fulfillment of any other significant obligations specific to the terms of the arrangement. Arrangements that do not contain any separable elements are typically recognized when the products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer.&nbsp;Certain contractual arrangements require longer production periods, generally longer thansixmonths (long-term contracts), and may contain non-routine installations and special acceptance protocols. These arrangements often include hardware and essential software, installation services, training and support. Long-term contractual arrangements involving essential software typically include significant production, modification, and customization. For long-term arrangements with essential software and all other long-term arrangements with complex installations and/or unusual acceptance protocols, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, based on the cost incurred to-date relative to estimated total cost of the contract. Elements of an arrangement that do not separately fall within the scope of the percentage of completion method (e.g. training and post contract software maintenance and support) are recognized as the service is provided in amounts determined based on VSOE, or in the absence of VSOE, the Company&#x2019;s best estimate of the selling price.&nbsp;Under the terms of the Company&#x2019;s long-term contracts, revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion method may not, in certain circumstances, be invoiced until completion of contractual milestones, upon shipment of the equipment, or upon installation and acceptance by the customer. Unbilled amounts for these contracts appear in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Unbilled Accounts Receivable.&nbsp;Revenue from arrangements for services such as maintenance, repair, consulting and technical support are recognized either as the service is performed or ratably over the defined contractual period for service maintenance contracts. Revenue from post contract software maintenance and support services is recognized ratably over the defined contractual period of the maintenance agreement.&nbsp;The Company&#x2019;s sales arrangements typically do not include specific performance-, cancellation-, termination-, or refund-type provisions. In the event a customer cancels a contractual arrangement, the Company would typically be entitled to receive reimbursement from the customer for actual costs incurred under the arrangement plus a reasonable margin.&nbsp;Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.&nbsp;Shipping and HandlingFreight revenue billed to customers is reported within Revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income, and expenses incurred for shipping products to customers are reported within Cost of Sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.&nbsp;Research and DevelopmentResearch and development costs associated with new products are charged to operations as incurred.&nbsp;Foreign CurrencyThe financial position and results of operations of the Company\'s foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using fiscal period-end exchange rates, and monthly statements of income are translated using average exchange rates applicable to each month, with the resulting translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of Shareholders\' Investment. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recorded net foreign currency transaction gains/(losses) of($1.8)million, $0.5million, and($0.1)million during the fiscalyear ended September 29, 2012, October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, respectively.&nbsp;Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents represent cash, demand deposits, and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents, both inside and outside theUnited States, are invested in money market funds and bank deposits in local currency denominations.&nbsp;Accounts Receivable and Long-Term ContractsThe Company grants credit to customers, but it generally does not require collateral or other security from domestic customers. When deemed appropriate, receivables from customers located outside theUnited Statesare supported by letters of credit from financial institutions. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management\'s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible and considers factors such as the financial condition of the customer and the aging of the receivables. If there is a deterioration of a customer\'s financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments were made.&nbsp;The Company enters into long-term contracts for customized equipment sold to its customers. Under the terms of such contracts, revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion method may be invoiced upon completion of contractual milestones, shipment to the customer, or installation and customer acceptance. Unbilled amounts relating to these contracts are reflected as Unbilled Accounts Receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts unbilled at September 29, 2012 are expected to be invoiced during fiscal year 2013.&nbsp;InventoriesInventories consist of material, labor, and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost or market value, determined under the first-in, first-out accounting method. Inventories at September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011were as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software Development CostsThe Company capitalizes certain software development costs related tosoftware to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed. Capitalized software development costs include purchased materials and services, salary and benefits of the Company&#x2019;s development and technical support staff, and other costs associated with the development of new products and services. Software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which timefuture costs incurred are capitalized until the product is available for general release to the public. Based on the Company&#x2019;s product development process, technological feasibility is generally established once product and detailed program designs have been completed, uncertainties related to high-riskdevelopmentissues have been resolved through coding and testing, and the Company has established that the necessary skills, hardware, and software technology are available for production of the product. Once a software product is available for general release to the public, capitalizeddevelopment costs associated with that productwill begin to be amortized to cost of sales over the product&#x2019;s estimated economic life, using the greater of straight-line or a method that results in cost recognition in future periods that is consistent with the anticipated timing of product revenue recognition.&nbsp;The Company&#x2019;s capitalized software development costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability, which is impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues and expenses for these software products, as well as other factors such as changes in product technologies. Any portion of unamortized capitalized software development costs that are determined to be in excess of net realizable value will be expensed in the period such a determination is made. The Company reached technological feasibility for certain software products and, as a result, capitalized $0.5million and $3.7million of software development costs during the fiscal years ended September 29, 2012 and October 1,2011, respectively.Amortization expense for software development costs was $2.6million, $1.5million and $1.3million for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2012, October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010, respectively. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional informationon capitalized software development costs.&nbsp;Impairment of Long-lived AssetsThe Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups, such as property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization, when events or changes in circumstances such as asset utilization, physical change, legal factors, or other matters indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When this review indicates the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group, the Company recognizes an asset impairment charge against operations. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is the amount by which the carrying value of the impaired asset or asset group exceeds its fair value.&nbsp;Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost. Additions, replacements, and improvements are capitalized at cost, while maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation is recorded over the following estimated useful lives of the property:&nbsp;Buildings and improvements:10to40yearsMachinery and equipment:3to10years&nbsp;Building and equipment additions are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes.See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on property and equipment.&nbsp;Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired.Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill is also tested for impairment as changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired.&nbsp;The Company hasthreereporting units,twoof which are assigned goodwill. At September 29, 2012, one reporting unit was assigned $14.7 million of goodwill while another was assigned $1.5 million.&nbsp;Impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, the asset is reduced to fair value. At both September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, there were no indefinite-lived intangible assets.&nbsp;Intangible assets with finite lives are amortizedon a straight-line basis over the expected period to be benefited by future cash flows, and reviewed for impairment. Fair values of goodwill and intangible assets are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses. At both September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, the Company determined there was no impairment of its goodwill or intangible assets. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.&nbsp;Other AssetsOther assets at September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 include security deposits paid on leased property and cash redemption values on group insurance policies.&nbsp;Warranty ObligationsSales of the Company&#x2019;s products and systems are subject to limited warranty obligations that are included in customer contracts. For sales that include installation services, warranty obligations typically extend for a period oftwelvetotwenty-fourmonths from the date of either shipment or acceptance. Product obligations typically extend for a period oftwelvetotwenty-fourmonths from the date of purchase. Under the terms of these warranties, the Company is obligated to repair or replace any components or assemblies it deems defective due to workmanship or materials. The Company reserves the right to reject warranty claims where it determines that failure is due to normal wear, customer modifications, improper maintenance, or misuse. The Company records general warranty provisions based on an estimated warranty expense percentage applied to current period revenue. The percentage applied reflects historical warranty claims experience over the precedingtwelve-month period. Both the experience percentage and the warranty liability are evaluated on an ongoing basis for adequacy. In addition,warranty provisions are also recognized for certain nonrecurring product claims that are individually significant.&nbsp;Warranty provisions and claims for the years ended September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, were as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company&#x2019;s results of operations could be materially impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as interest rates on its floating rate indebtedness. In an effort to manage exposure to these risks, the Company periodically enters into forward and option currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and forward interest rate swaps. Because the market value of these hedging contracts is derived from current market rates, they are classified as derivative financial instruments. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The derivative contracts contain credit risk to the extent that the Company&#x2019;s bank counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. The amount of such credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains, if any, in such contracts. Such risk is minimized by limiting those counterparties to major financial institutions of high credit quality. For derivative instruments executed under master netting arrangements, the Company has the contractual right to offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral with obligations to return cash collateral. The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized on these derivative instruments. At both September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, the Company did not have any foreign exchange contracts with credit-risk related contingent features.&nbsp;The Company&#x2019;s currency exchange and interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. The Company also has derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, are accounted for and reported under the guidance of ASC 830. Regardless of designation for accounting purposes, the Company believes that all of its derivative instruments are hedges of transactional risk exposures. The fair value of the Company&#x2019;s outstanding designated and undesignated derivative assets and liabilities are reported in the September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash Flow Hedging &#x2013; Currency RisksCurrency exchange contracts utilized to maintain the functional currency value of expected financial transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as cash flow hedges. Qualifying gains and losses related to changes in the market value of these contracts are reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#x201C;AOCI&#x201D;) within Shareholders&#x2019; Investment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. The effective portion of the cash flow hedges represents the change in fair value of the hedge that offsets the change in the functional currency value of the hedged item. The Company periodically assesses whether its currency exchange contracts are effective and, when a contract is determined to be no longer effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. Subsequent changes in the market value of ineffective currency exchange contracts are recognized as an increase or decrease in Revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Income, as that is the same line item in which the underlying hedged transaction is reported.&nbsp;At September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, the Company had outstanding cash flow hedge currency exchange contracts with gross notional U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of $60.4million and $54.7million, respectively. Upon netting offsetting contracts to sell foreign currencies against contracts to purchase foreign currencies, irrespective of contract maturity dates, the net notional U.S. dollar equivalent amount of contracts outstanding were $49.7million and $46.8million at September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, respectively. At September 29, 2012, the net market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts was a net liability of $0.7million, consisting of $1.1million in liabilities and $0.4million in assets. At October 1, 2011 the net market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts was a net liability of $0.3million, consisting of $1.0million in liabilities and $0.7million in assets.&nbsp;The pretax amounts recognized in AOCI on currency exchange contracts for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, including gains (losses) reclassified into earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Income and gains (losses) recognized in other comprehensive income (&#x201C;OCI&#x201D;), are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount recognized in earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was less than $0.1million in each of the fiscal years ended September 29, 2012,October 1, 2011and October 2, 2010. At September 29, 2012, the amount projected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings in the next 12 months was a net loss of $0.9million. The maximum remaining maturity of any forward or optional contract at September 29, 2012 was1.8years.&nbsp;Cash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate RisksDuring the fiscal years ended September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, the Company used floating to fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate its exposure to future changes in interest rates related to its floating rate indebtedness. The Company had designated these interest rate swap arrangements as cash flow hedges. As a result, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded in AOCI within Shareholders&#x2019; Investment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets throughout the entire contractual term of each of the interest rate swap arrangements.&nbsp;During the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012, all of the Company&#x2019;s interest rate swap arrangements expired and, as a result, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap arrangements at September 29, 2012. At October 1, 2011, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of $24.0million. In January 2011, the Company entered into forward interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $27.0million effective December 2011 to pay fixed interest rates ranging from1.02% to1.08% in exchange for interest received at monthly U.S. LIBOR.&nbsp;During the periods each of the interest rates swaps were outstanding, the Company paid fixed interest in exchange for interest received at monthly U.S. LIBOR. At October 1, 2011, the weighted-average interest rate payable by the Company under the terms of the credit facility borrowings and outstanding interest rate swaps was2.47%. At October 1, 2011, there was a45basis-point differential between the variable rate interest paid by the Company on its outstanding credit facility borrowings and the variable rate interest received on the interest rate swaps. As a result of this differential, the overall effective interest rate applicable to outstanding credit facility borrowings, under the terms of the credit facility and interest rate swap agreements at October 1, 2011, was2.92%.&nbsp;The total market value of interest rate swaps and forward interest rate swaps at October 1, 2011 was a liability of $0.6million. The pretax amounts recognized in AOCI on interest rate swaps and forward interest rate swaps for fiscal years ended September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Currency Balance Sheet DerivativesThe Company also uses foreign currency derivative contracts to maintain the functional currency value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional foreign currencies. The gains and losses related to the changes in the market value of these derivative contracts are included in Other Income (Expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.&nbsp;At September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011, the Company had outstanding foreign currency balance sheet derivative contracts with gross notional U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of $51.4million and $15.9million, respectively. Upon netting offsetting contracts by counterparty banks to sell foreign currencies against contracts to purchase foreign currencies, irrespective of contract maturity dates, the net notional U.S. dollar equivalent amount of contracts outstanding at September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 was $6.6and $4.4million, respectively. At September 29, 2012, the net market value of the foreign exchange balance sheet derivative contracts was a net liability of $0.4million. At October 1, 2011, the net market value of the foreign exchange balance sheet derivative contracts was a net asset of $0.2million.&nbsp;The net losses recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income on foreign exchange balance sheet derivative contracts for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2012, October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010 are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income TaxesThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The Company believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net realizable value of its deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#x2019;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#x2019;s financial condition and operating results. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.&nbsp;Earnings Per Common ShareBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the daily weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable periods. Using the treasury stock method, diluted earnings per share includes the potentially dilutive effect of common shares issued in connection with outstanding stock-based compensation options and grants. Under the treasury stock method, shares associated with certain stock options have been excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding calculation because the exercise of those options would lead to a net reduction in common shares outstanding. As a result, stock options to acquire0.4million,0.4million, and1.2million weighted common shares have been excluded from the diluted weighted shares outstanding calculation for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2012, October 1, 2011, and October 2, 2010, respectively. The potentially dilutive effect of common shares issued in connection with outstanding stock options is determined based on income before discontinued operations. A reconciliation of these amounts is as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock PurchasesDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, the Company entered into an accelerated share purchase agreement with an unrelated third party investment bank. This forward contract is indexed to, and potentially settled in, the Company&#x2019;s common stock. This forward contract meets the requirements of ASC 815-40 to be classified as permanent equity. In connection with the agreement, the Company made an initial $35.0million payment to the investment bank and immediately received an initial delivery of approximately0.5million shares of its common stock with a fair value of $28.0million as of the purchase date. Effective as of the date of the initial0.5million stock purchase, the transaction was accounted for as a share retirement, resulting in a reduction of common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings of $0.1million, $26.1million and $1.8million, respectively. The remaining $7.0million of the Company&#x2019;s initial payment to the investment bank was reported as a reduction in retained earnings. As long as the forward contract continues to meet the requirements to be classified as permanent equity, the Company will not record future changes in its fair value. The contract continued to meet those requirements as of September 29, 2012 and the Company expects it will continue to meet those requirements through the settlement date. The agreement expires in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013; however the investment bank has the right to accelerate the end of the purchase period. Upon settlement of the contract, the Company will adjust common stock, as well as either additional paid-in capital or retained earnings, as appropriate, to reflect the final settlement amount.&nbsp;The specific number of shares that the Company will ultimately purchase under the accelerated share purchase agreement will be based on the volume weighted average price (&#x201C;VWAP&#x201D;) of the Company&#x2019;s common stock during the purchase period, less an agreed upon discount, unless such discounted VWAP were to fall below a specified floor price, in which case the floor price would be in effect. The maximum amount of shares of common stock the Company can be required to issue to settle the agreement cannot exceed2.0million. At September 29, 2012, if the accelerated share purchase agreement had been settled on that date, the investment bank would have been required to deliver to the Company approximately128,000shares of the Company&#x2019;s common stock. For every $1.00increase or decrease in the Company&#x2019;s VWAP, the settlement amount changes by approximately12,000shares.&nbsp;During the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company paid $9.6million pursuant to the settlement of an accelerated share purchase agreement with an unrelated third party investment bank. This agreement was initially entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. During the entire term of the agreement, the forward contract was indexed to, and could potentially have been settled in, the Company&#x2019;s common stock. As a result, the forward contract met the requirements of ASC 815-40 to be classified as permanent equity. In connection with the agreement, the Company made an initial $25.0million payment to the investment bank and immediately received approximately0.9million shares of its common stock. Effective as of the date of the initial stock purchase, the transaction was accounted for as a share retirement resulting in a reduction of common stock and retained earnings of $0.2million and $24.8million, respectively. Upon settlement of the contract, the Company reducedadditional paid-in capital by $9.6million.&nbsp;Stock-Based CompensationThe Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, and recognizes the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award.&nbsp;For purposes of determining estimated fair value of stock-based payment awards, the Company utilizes a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of certain assumptions requiring management judgment. Because the Company&#x2019;s employee stock option awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates, existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee stock options. Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of stock-based compensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time that could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact the fair value determination of future grants of stock-based payment awards. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in future periods, the compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from the stock-based compensation expense recorded in the current period.See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on stock-based compensation.&nbsp;Comprehensive IncomeComprehensive Income, a component of Shareholders&#x2019; Investment, for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2012, October 1, 2011 and October 2, 2010 consists of net income, pension benefit plan adjustments, derivative instrument gains or losses and foreign currency translation adjustments.&nbsp;The accumulated balances for each component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income were as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Additionally, the Company frequently undertakes significant technological innovation on certain of its long-term contracts, involving performance risk that may result in delayed delivery of product and/or revenue and gross profit variation due to changes in the ultimate costs of these contracts versus estimates.&nbsp;Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#x201C;FASB&#x201D;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#x201C;ASU&#x201D;) 2011-05, &#x201C;Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Presentation of Comprehensive Income.&#x201D; ASU 2011-05 amends Topic 220, &#x201C;Comprehensive Income,&#x201D; to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders&#x2019; investment. The amendments to the Codification in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The provisions of ASU 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 which, for the Company, will be the beginning of fiscal year 2013. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2011-05will not have amaterial impact onthe Company&#x2019;sconsolidated financial statements.'

S'Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesGeneralUpstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations relate primarily to refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and additives for fuels and lubricant oils.     The company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as future confirming events occur.Subsidiary and Affiliated CompaniesThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than50 percent-owned and any variable-interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. As part of that accounting, the company recognizes gains and losses that arise from the issuance of stock by an affiliate that results in changes in the company&#8217;s proportionate share of the dollar amount of the affiliate&#8217;s equity currently in income.     Investments are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company&#8217;s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee&#8217;s financial performance, and the company&#8217;s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient toallow for any anticipated recovery in the investment&#8217;s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.      Differences between the company&#8217;s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company&#8217;s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company&#8217;s share of the affiliate&#8217;s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate&#8217;s historical book values.DerivativesThe majority of the company&#8217;s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, generally limited to large, discrete or infrequently occurring transactions, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting. For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company&#8217;s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company&#8217;s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.Short-Term InvestmentsAll short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are in highly liquid debt securities. Those investments that are part of the company&#8217;s cash management portfolio and have original maturities of three months or less are reported as &#8220;Cash equivalents.&#8221; Bank time deposits with maturities greater than90 days are reported as &#8220;Time deposits.&#8221; The balance of short-term investments is reported as &#8220;Marketable securities&#8221; and is marked-to-market, with any unrealized gains or losses included in &#8220;Other comprehensive income.&#8221;InventoriesCrude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. &#8220;Materials, supplies and other&#8221; inventories generally are stated at average cost.Properties, Plant and EquipmentThe successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 18, beginning on page FS-47, for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.     Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net before-tax cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset, significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net before-tax cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties in the United States, the company generally performs an impairment review on an individual field basis. Outside the United States, reviews are performed on a country, concession, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental &#8220;Depreciation, depletion and amortization&#8221; expense.     Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 8, beginning on page FS-33, relating to fair value measurements.     The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associ-ated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 23, on page FS-58, relating to AROs.     Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Periodic valuation provisions for impairment of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.     The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize all capitalized leased assets.     Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as &#8220;Other income.&#8221;     Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.GoodwillGoodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. As required by accounting standards for goodwill (ASC 350), the company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.Environmental ExpendituresEnvironmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.     Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For the company&#8217;s U.S. and Canadian marketing facilities, the accrual is based in part on the probability that a future remediation commitment will be required. For crude oil, natural gas andmineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 23, on page FS-58, for a discussion of the company&#8217;s AROs.     For federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares.     The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company&#8217;s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company&#8217;s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.Currency TranslationThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company&#8217;s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in &#8220;Currency translation adjustment&#8221; on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.Revenue RecognitionRevenues associated with sales of crude oil, natural gas, coal, petroleum and chemicals products, and all other sources are recorded when title passes to the customer, net of royalties, discounts and allowances, as applicable. Revenues from natural gas production from properties in which Chevron has an interest with other producers are generally recognized using the entitlement method. Excise, value-added and similar taxes assessed by a governmental authority on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer are presented on a gross basis. The associated amounts are shown as a footnote to the Consolidated Statement of Income, on page FS-23. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in &#8220;Purchased crude oil and products&#8221; on the Consolidated Statement of Income.Stock Options and Other Share-Based CompensationThe company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to its employees and accounts for these transactions under the accounting standards for share-based compensation (ASC 718). For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the company&#8217;s Long-Term Incentive Plan have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The company amortizes these graded awards on a straight-line basis.'

S'2. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of presentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#8220;US GAAP&#8221;).Principles of consolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated.Business combinationBusiness combinations are recorded using the purchase method of accounting. On January 1, 2009, the Group adopted a new accounting pronouncement with prospective application, which made certain changes to the previous authoritative literature on business combinations. From January 1, 2009, the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and the noncontrolling interest of the acquiree at the acquisition date, if any, are measured at their fair values as of that date. Consideration transferred in a business acquisition is also measured at the fair value as at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognized and measured as the excess of the total consideration transferred plus the fair value of the noncontrolling interest of the acquiree, if any, at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, such excess is recognized in earnings as a gain. Previously, any non-controlling interest was reflected at historical cost.Where the consideration in an acquisition includes contingent consideration the payment of which depends on the achievement of certain specified conditions post-acquisition, from January 1, 2009 the contingent consideration is recognized and measured at its fair value at the acquisition date and if recorded as a liability it is subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings.Foreign currency translationThe functional currency of the Company and AFC is the United States dollar (&#8220;US$&#8221;, or &#8220;$&#8221;). The Group&#8217;s principal country of operations is the PRC. The financial position and results of operations of the subsidiaries are determined using the local currency (&#8220;Renminbi&#8221; or &#8220;RMB&#8221;) as the functional currency.Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the market rate of exchange in effect at that date. The registered equity capital denominated in the functional currency is translated at the historical rate of exchange at the time of capital contribution. Revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated using the average rate for the year. All translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements into US$ are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders&#8217; equity. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency during the year are converted into functional currency at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occurred. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in the statements of income and comprehensive income.Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents represent cash on hand, demand deposits and highly liquid investments placed with banks or other financial institutions, which have original maturities less than three months. The carrying amounts reported approximate their fair value.Trade receivables, net, and notes receivable, netThe Group&#8217;s trade receivables are due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on evaluation of customers&#8217; financial condition. Trade receivable payment terms vary and amounts due from customers are stated in the financial statements net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. The Group determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time the receivable is past due, the Group&#8217;s previous loss history, the counter party&#8217;s current ability to pay its obligation to the Group, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Group writes off receivables when they are deemed uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts.Notes receivable consists of one promissory note (See Note 4(3)) and one note issued by a bank in the PRC received from a trade customer. Notes receivable are reviewed periodically as to whether their carrying value has become impaired. The Group considers the assets to be impaired if the collectability of the balances become doubtful. Interest is not accrued on notes receivable where the collectability of the balances are doubtful.InventoriesInventories consist of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market value. The value of inventories is determined using the moving weighted average cost method and includes any related production overhead costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Overhead costs included in finished goods include, direct labor cost and other costs directly applicable to the manufacturing process.The Group estimates an inventory allowance for excessive, slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value is in excess of net realizable value. Inventory amounts are reported net of such allowances of $359,957 and $392,368 as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.Available-for-sale securitiesInvestment in securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair market value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in the accumulated other comprehensive income.The fair value of substantially all securities is determined by quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of securities for which there are no quoted market prices is based on similar types of securities that are traded in the market.InvestmentsInvestment at cost represents an investment in a non-marketable equity interest. Fair value is not estimated unless impairment is indicated. The Group has concluded that there are no impaired investments as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.Assets held for saleThe Group considers properties to be assets held for sale when all of the following criteria are met: i) a formal commitment to a plan to sell a property was made and exercised; ii) the property is available for sale in its present condition; iii) actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated; iv) sale of the property is probable and the Group expects the completed sale will occur within one year; and v) the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value.Upon designation as an asset held for sale, the Group records the carrying value of each property at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and the Group ceases depreciation.Property, plant and equipment, netProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements, maintenance, and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations in the year of retirement or disposition.Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for significant property, plant and equipment categories are as follows:Construction in progressAll facilities purchased for installation, self-made or subcontracted are accounted for as construction in progress. Construction in progress is recorded at acquisition cost, including cost of facilities, installation expenses and interest. Upon completion and readiness for use of the project, the cost of construction in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment.Interest costs associated with construction in progress are capitalized in the period they are incurred. Interest is no longer capitalized when the asset is completed and ready for use.Prepaid leases for land use rightsAll lands in the PRC are state-owned and no individual land ownership right exists. The Group acquired the rights to use certain lands and the premiums paid for such rights are recorded as prepaid leases and amortized over the use terms of 40 to 50 years in the statements of income and comprehensive income using the straight-line method.Certain of the land use rights can only be used by the Group to which the right was granted and cannot be transferred or sold to others.Other intangible assets, netOther intangible assets consist of production permits and exclusive rights of milk supply, which are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of one and 4.7 years, respectively.Impairment of long-lived assetsThe Group reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the related carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. Factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors. Impairment of other intangible assets were nil, $457,023 and nil in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets and intangible assets acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. At the end of each year, the Group tests impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level and recognizes impairment in the event that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units based on their discounted cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step, a second step is performed, in which the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. The second step requires the Company to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit derived in the first step to the fair value of the reporting unit&#8217;s net assets, with any fair value in excess of amounts allocated to such net assets representing the implied fair value of goodwill for that reporting unit. If the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, such goodwill is written down by an amount equal to such excess. Impairment of goodwill was nil, $555,387 and $1,437,005 in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Advances from customersRevenue from the sale of goods is recognized when goods are shipped. Receipts in advance for goods to be shipped in the future are recorded as advances from customers.Fair value of financial instrumentsFinancial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade and notes receivables, available for sale investments, amounts due from/to related parties, accounts payable, bank loans and other current liabilities, and capital lease obligation. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable, amounts due from related parties, other current liabilities, and amount due to related parties approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.Bank loans and capital lease obligation are interest bearing. Because the stated interest rate reflects the market rate, the carrying amount of the bank loans and capital lease obligations approximates its fair value. Fair value of available for sale investments are based upon quoted market prices.Revenue recognitionRevenue from the sale of goods, net of a value-added tax (&#8220;VAT&#8221;), is recognized on the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership, which coincides with the time when the goods are shipped to customers and the title has passed.Revenue is shown net of sales returns, which amounted to less than 0.8% of total sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, and net of sales discounts, which are determined based on the distributors&#8217; sales volumes.Cost of goods soldCost of goods sold primarily consists of direct and indirect manufacturing costs, including production overhead costs for the products sold.Sales and marketingSales and marketing costs consist primarily of advertising and market promotion expenses, and other overhead expenses incurred by the Group&#8217;s sales and marketing personnel. Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses from continuing operations amounted to $17,183,533, $7,159,269 and $21,727,818 during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Market promotion expenses from continuing operations amount to $42,197,001, $30,455,332 and $22,022,673 during the years ended December 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. There were no advertising expenses and market promotion expenses from the Company&#8217;s discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.Any shipping, handling or other costs incurred by the Group associated with the sale are expensed as sales and marketing expenses in the period when the sale occurs. Such costs from continuing operations amounted to $6,871,782, $6,762,083 and $7,920,298 during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were no shipping and handling costs from the Company&#8217;s discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.Product display feesThe Company has entered into a number of agreements with its resellers, whereby the Company pays the reseller an agreed upon amount to display its products. In accordance with ASC 605-50-45, the Company has reduced sales by the amount paid under these agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, product display fees from continuing operations were $23,551,770, $20,180,305, and $29,346,857, respectively. There were no product display fees in relation to the Company&#8217;s discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.Share-based compensationShare-based compensation to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument as at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model, which requires assumptions for dividend yield, expected volatility and expected life of stock options. The expected life of stock options is estimated by observing general option holder behavior. The assumption of the expected volatility has been set by reference to the implied volatility of our shares in the open market and historical patterns of volatility. Performance and service vesting conditions attached to the options are included in assumptions about the number of shares that the option holder will ultimately receive. On a regular basis the Company reviews the assumptions made and revises the estimate of the number of options expected to be settled, where necessary. Significant factors affecting the fair value of option awards include the estimated future volatility of our stock price and the estimated expected term until the option award is exercised or cancelled.The Company recognizes the compensation costs net of a forfeiture rate and recognizes the compensation costs for those shares expected to vest on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period of the award. The estimate of forfeitures is adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of stock compensation expense to be recognized in future periods.The fair value of awards is amortized over the requisite service period, except for 2,073,190 options granted in May 2009 and 1,332,000 options granted in July 2011 that were to vest upon performance conditions. For such performance based awards, the Company assessed the probability of meeting such conditions in order to determine the compensation cost to be recognized. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.4 million, $1.7 million, and $2.6 million, respectively.Other operating incomeOther operating income primarily includes fines the Company imposed on its distributors for impermissible cross-territory sales activities and is recognized as income when the Company receives the funds.Government subsidiesGovernment subsidies granted to purchase manufacturing facilities are recorded as deferred income when the Group receives the funds. Such deferred income is amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the relevant manufacturing facilities, and are recorded as a reduction in cost of goods sold.Government subsidies received by the Group without the appropriate documentation from the local government authorities to specify the purpose of the funds granted are recorded as deferred income, and are recognized as other income to match with the expenditure to which the grant relates once the Group obtains the appropriate documentation from the local government authorities.The Group&#8217;s entities that operate production facilities in Heilongjiang Province in the PRC, namely Feihe Dairy and Gannan Feihe, receive subsidies from the local government authorities as incentives to support the Group&#8217;s business development and local economy. These subsidies are based on certain amounts of taxes paid by the entities but are not refunds of the tax paid from the taxing authority. They are without condition and recorded as other income upon receipt.For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Group&#8217;s continued operations recognized government subsidies of $10,435,291, $9,205,157 and $21,709,399, respectively, that are included as other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. The Company&#8217;s discontinued operations recognized government subsidies of nil, $90,452 and $1,752,683, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, deferred income related to government subsidies amounted to $4,320,779 and $3,711,033 respectively, and are included as non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.LeasesLeases are classified as capital or operating leases. Leases where substantially all the rewards and risks incidental to ownership of assets are transferred to the lessee is classified as capital leases. At inception, capital leases are recorded at present value of minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset, whichever is less. Assets under capital leases are amortized on a basis consistent with that of similar property, plant and equipment. Leases where substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership of assets remain with the lesser are accounted for as operating leases. Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. TaxationTaxation -Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Net operating loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics.The Company adopted ASC 740-10, &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; effective April 1, 2007. In accordance with ASC 740-10, the Company recognizes a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in its judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company initially and subsequently measures the tax benefit as the largest amount that it judges to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The Company&#8217;s liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. The Company classifies interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The Company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes.Refer to Note 5 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the components of the Company&#8217;s income taxes.Comprehensive incomeComprehensive income includes net income, unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale investments and foreign currency translation adjustments.The consolidated financial statements have been adjusted for the retrospective application of the authoritative guidance regarding presentation of comprehensive income, which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2012.Net income (loss) per shareNet income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.The Group has determined that its redeemable common shares were participating securities as the redeemable common shares participate in undistributed earnings on an as-if-converted basis. Accordingly, the Group has applied the two-class method of computing net income (loss) per share, for common and redeemable common shares according to their respective rights to participate in earnings. Under this method, undistributed net income (loss) is allocated on a pro rata basis to the holders of common and redeemable common shares to the extent that each class may share income for the period.Diluted net income (loss) per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted into common shares. The dilutive effect of stock options is computed using treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible debt is computed using as-if converted method.Segment reportingUntil October 31, 2011, the Company had two reportable segments: dairy products and dairy farms. The dairy products segment produces and sells dairy products, such as wholesale and retail milk powders as well as soybean powder, rice cereal, walnut powder and walnut oil. In October 2011, the Company sold its Dairy Farms in the PRC (see Note 7). As of December 31, 2012, the Company&#8217;s operations comprised a single segment - dairy products. As the Group primarily generates its revenues from customers in the PRC, no geographical segments are presented.Use of estimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are allowance for doubtful accounts on receivables, reserves for inventory, estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, share-based compensation, purchase price allocation in business combinations, unrecognized tax benefits and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.'

S'Nature of business: Synergetics USA, Inc. ("Synergetics USA" or the "Company") is a Delaware corporation incorporated on June 2, 2005, in connection with the reverse merger of Synergetics, Inc. ("Synergetics") and Valley Forge Scientific Corp. ("Valley Forge") and the subsequent reincorporation of Valley Forge (the predecessor to Synergetics USA) in Delaware. Synergetics USA is a leading supplier of precision surgical devices.  Through continuous improvement and development of its people, the Company\'smissionis to design, manufacture and market innovative surgical devices, surgical equipment and consumables of the highest quality in order to assist and enable surgeons who perform surgery around the world to provide a better quality of life for their patients.   The Company\'s primary focus is on the surgical disciplines of ophthalmology and neurosurgery. Its distribution channels include a combination of direct and independent distributor sales organizations and important strategic alliances with market leaders. The Company is located in O\'Fallon, Missouri and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  During the ordinary course of its business, the Company grants unsecured credit to its domestic and international customers.A summary of the Company\'s significant accounting policies follows:Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.Principles of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Synergetics USA and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Synergetics, Synergetics IP, Inc., Synergetics Development Company, LLC and Synergetics Delaware, Inc.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.Cash and cash equivalents: For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.Accounts receivable: During the ordinary course of its business, the Company grants unsecured credit to its domestic and international customers.  Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis.  Collateral is not generally required on the Company\'s accounts receivable.  Accounts receivable are generally considered past due based upon their specific terms.  Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer\'s financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions.  Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible.  Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received.  The Company generally does not charge interest on past-due amounts in accounts receivable.  The Company has a history of minimal uncollectible accounts. Concentration of credit risk: Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.  The Company\'s cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in a money market account in a bank and currently exceed the FDIC insurance limit.  Generally these deposits can be redeemed upon demand and therefore, bear minimal risk.Inventories: Inventories, consisting of purchased materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method, or market.  The Company\'s inventory is very dynamic and new products are added frequently.  Thus, the Company reviews the valuation of its inventory on a quarterly basis and determines if a valuation allowance is necessary for items that have not had their values updated recently.  In addition, the Company evaluates inventories for excess quantities and identified obsolescence quarterly.  The Company\'s evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand, as well as estimates of quantities required to support warranty and other repairs.  To the extent that it determines there are some excess quantities based on its projected levels of sales and other requirements, or obsolete material in inventory, it records valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related parts or products.  If future cost valuations, future demand or market conditions are different from the Company\'s projections, a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made.Property and equipment: Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows:Goodwill and other intangibles: Absent any impairment indicators, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis.  The Company performs its goodwill impairment tests during the fourth fiscal quarter.  Other intangible assets, consisting of licensing agreements and proprietary know-how are amortized to operations under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or statutory lives, whichever is shorter.  These periods range from two to seventeen years.  The life of a trademark is inextricably related to the life of the product bearing the mark or the life of the business entity owning the trademark.  The Company intends to use the trademark indefinitely, and therefore, its useful life is not limited to any specific product. The trademark constitutes an indefinite-lived intangible that will be used in perpetuity.  Proprietary know-how consists of the patented technology which is included in one of the Company\'s core products, bipolar electrosurgical generators.  As a proprietary technology is a distinguishing feature of the Company\'s products, it represents a valuable intangible asset.Patents: Incremental legal and other costs to obtain the patent are capitalized to a patent asset.  Salaries, benefits and other direct costs of product development are expensed as operating expenses in research and development ("R&amp;D") costs.  Patents are amortized to operations under the straight-line method over the remaining statutory life of the patent.  Total amortization for the years ended July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $600,000, $653,000 and $879,000, respectively.Deferred revenue: During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company received a payment from Codman &amp; Shurtleff, Inc. ("Codman"), a marketing partner, to establish exclusivity on certain generator products and accessories.  Revenue from the agreement has been deferred and is being amortized over its expected term.  The Company recognized $266,000 and $334,000 in revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2012 and July 31, 2011, respectively, under the terms of the exclusivity agreement.On April 23, 2010, the Company entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with Alcon, Inc. ("Alcon")  pursuant to which Alcon paid to the Company $32.0 million. The net proceeds to the Company were $21.4 million after contingency payments to attorneys. The Company recognized a gain from this agreement of $2.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The remaining $19.0 million has been accounted for as an up-front license fee under the Confidential Settlement and License Agreement and was deferred and recognized as earned over a period estimated to be 15 years based upon estimated shipments to Alcon under a related Supply Agreement.  On February 13, 2012, Alcon informed the Company that it had decided to cancel the project, orders and forecasts covering the two products to have been supplied under the Supply Agreement. However, the Supply Agreement remains in effect and the Company has continuing performance obligations associated with the Supply Agreement. Therefore, the Company plans on recognizing the remaining deferred revenue associated with the Supply Agreement ratably over the next 14 years which is the remaining life of the patents and associated Supply Agreement. The Company recognized $1.2 million and $696,000 of this deferred revenue for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.Impairment of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and other intangibles): The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.  Assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.Product warranty: The Company provides a warranty against manufacturing and workmanship defects. Under the Company\'s general terms and conditions of sale, liability during the warranty period (typically three years) is limited to repair or replacement of the defective item. The Company\'s warranty cost is not material.Income taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 740, "Income Taxes" ("ASC Topic 740").  Under ASC Topic 740, the deferred tax provision is determined using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss, tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.In addition, under ASC Topic 740, the Company may recognize tax liabilities when, despite the Company\'s belief that its tax return positions are supported, the Company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities.  The Company has identified no uncertain tax positions subsequent to the adoption of this standard on August 1, 2007.The Company\'s policy is to recognize interest and penalties through income tax expense.  As of July 31, 2012, the 2009 to 2011 tax years remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.  There are no federal or non-U.S. income tax audits in process as of July 31, 2012. There is one state audit currently in progress. Fair value of financial instruments: The Company\'s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt.  As of July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.  The carrying amount of notes payable is estimated to approximate fair value because the interest rates fluctuate with market interest rates or the fixed rates are based on estimated current rates offered to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities.Non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are measured at fair value when there is an indicator of impairment and recorded at fair value only when impairment is recognized.  No impairment indicators existed as of July 31, 2012.Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity\'s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).  The fair value hierarchy consists of these broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  The Company\'s Level 1 financial assets are money market funds, whose fair values are based on quoted market prices.  The Company does not have any Level 2 or Level 3 financial assets. Foreign currency translation:All balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Statements of income amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year.  The gains and losses resulting from the changes in exchange rates from year to year have been reported in other comprehensive income (loss).  The foreign currency translation adjustment is the only component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Foreign currency translation adjustments exclude income tax expense (benefit) given that the Company\'s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries are deemed to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time.Revenue recognition: The Company primarily records revenue from product sales when the revenue is realized and the product is shipped from its facilities.  This includes satisfying the following criteria: the arrangement with the customer is evident, usually through the receipt of a purchase order; the sales price is fixed and determinable; delivery to the carrier has occurred; and collectability is reasonably ensured. Freight and shipping billed to customers is included in net sales, and the cost of shipping is included in cost of sales.  Sales tax billed to customers is included as a liability as products are shipped.The terms and conditions of sales to both the Company\'s domestic and international distributors do not differ materially from the terms and conditions of sales to its domestic and international end-user customers.Service revenue substantially relates to repairs of products and is recognized when the service has been completed.  Revenue from royalty fees is recorded as the products bearing the trademark are shipped.Advertising: The Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $153,000, $119,500 and $41,600 for the years ended July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Royalties: The Company pays royalties to doctors and medical institutions for providing assistance in the design and development of various devices and components.  Royalties are paid quarterly based on the sales of the instrument or components.  Royalty expense was approximately $281,600, $318,000 and $830,800 for the years ended July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Stock compensation: The Company has a stock plan for employees and consultants allowing for incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and stock awards which have been granted to certain employees and consultants of the Company.  In addition, the Company has a stock option plan for non-employee directors allowing for non-qualified stock options.  Options under this plan have been granted to all non-employee directors.  Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized over the directors\' and employees\' requisite service period. Compensation expense is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  In addition, compensation expense equal to number of shares granted multiplied by the market value on the date of the grant over the restriction period is recognized in net earnings for restricted stock awards. Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share ("EPS") data has been computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period presented.  Diluted EPS data has been computed on the basis of the assumed conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock instruments, unless the effect is to reduce the loss or increase the net income per common share (dollars in thousands, except share and per share data):Stock option shares excluded from computation of dilutive income per share because the effect would be antidilutive for the years ended July 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were 215,734, 60,000 and 228,000, respectively. Segment reporting: Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive Officer in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  The Company\'s chief decision maker reviews the results of operations and requests for capital expenditures based on one industry segment: producing and selling products and procedures for surgery, primarily for vitreoretinal surgery and neurosurgery.  The Company\'s entire revenue is generated through this segment.  Revenues are attributed to countries based upon the location of end-user customers or distributors. Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year\'s presentation with respect to the plastic injection molding operations being classified as discontinued.'

S'Significant Accounting PoliciesPrinciples of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of XO Group Inc. ("the Company") and all100%and majority owned subsidiaries, prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in which the Company has at least a20%, but not more than a50%interest are generally accounted for under the equity method. Investment interests below20%are generally accounted for under the cost method, except if the Company could exercise significant influence, the investment would be accounted for under the equity method.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of fair value of equity awards issued, fair value of the Company\'s reporting unit, valuation of intangible assets (and their related useful lives), certain components of the income tax provisions, including valuation allowances on the Company\'s deferred tax assets, compensation accruals, allowances for bad debts, inventory obsolescence reserves and reserves for future returns. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements.Comparative DataCertain prior year financial statement line items and disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the current year\'s presentation. The Company reclassified$4.5 millionof long-term deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2013 to long-term deferred tax assets to be consistent with current year presentation.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity ofthreemonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and money market funds. The market value of the Company&#8217;s cash equivalents approximates their cost plus accrued interest.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying amounts of the Company\'s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value as ofDecember 31, 2014and2013due to the short-term nature of these instruments.InventoryInventory consists of finished goods and raw materials. Inventory costs are determined principally by using the average cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.Deferred Production and Marketing CostsDeferred production and marketing costs include certain magazine and online video production costs and prepaid sales commissions, which are deferred and expensed as the related revenue is recognized.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range fromthreetosevenyears. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the related lease agreement. The Company capitalizes qualifying computer software costs incurred during the application development stage and amortizes these costs over the estimated useful life of the software, ranging fromonetothreeyears, on a straight-line basis, beginning when the software is ready for its intended use. For the years endedDecember 31, 2014,2013and2012, the Company recorded amortization of capitalized software of$2.2 million,$1.4 million, and$1.3 million, respectively. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred while expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Upon the disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. For the year endedDecember 31, 2014, the Company recorded impairments of certain long-lived assets of$0.6 million. There were no impairment charges on long-lived assets in the years ended December 31,2013and2012.Goodwill, Other Intangible and Long-Lived AssetsGoodwill is the excess purchase price remaining from an acquisition after an allocation of purchase price has been made to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step test that is performed at the reporting unit level. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, there is an indication of a potential impairment and the second step of the test is performed to measure the amount of impairment. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step, which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit\'s goodwill to its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value, excluding goodwill. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted.In accordance with accounting guidance, the Company may first perform a qualitative goodwill assessment to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Factors such as macroeconomic conditions; industry and market considerations; cost factors and other are used to assess the validity of goodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step goodwill impairment test, as described above, is not necessary. If, however, the Company concludes otherwise, then the Company must perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by comparing the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value with its carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, then the Company must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the impairment loss, if any.The Company\'s intangible assets deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, on a straight-line basis as follows:The Company\'s long-lived assets primarily consist of software, leasehold improvements, computer and office equipment and furniture and fixtures, which are subject to depreciation over the useful life of the asset. Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired. In evaluating an asset for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition. If the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss, equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset, is recognized. The Company performs impairment evaluations annually as of October 1, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the years endedDecember 31, 2014,2013, and2012, the Company recorded impairments of certain intangible assets of$0.2 million,$1.4 million, and$1.0 million, respectively. See Note 6 for additional details on the impairments of certain intangible assets recorded during the year.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as required by the accounting standard for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.Each reporting period, the Company assesses whether its deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not realizable, in determining whether it is necessary to record a valuation allowance. This includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of the Company\'s deferred tax assets.The Company records interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense.The Company recognizes the impact of an uncertain tax position in its financial statements if, in management\'s judgment, the position is more-likely-then-not sustainable upon audit based on the position\'s technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and measurement of the amount of each uncertain tax position that is more-likely-than-not sustainable.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue primarily from the sale of online advertising programs, commissions earned in connection with the sale of gift registry products, the sale of merchandise and the publication of magazines, provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the service has been provided or the product has been shipped, selling price is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and the Company has no significant remaining obligation.Online programs are designed to integrate advertising with online editorial content. Advertisers can purchase the exclusive right to promote products or services on a specific online editorial area and can purchase a special feature on the Company&#8217;s sites. These arrangements commonly include banner advertisements and direct e-mail marketing. Advertisers can also promote their services and products within the programming on the Company&#8217;s streaming video channels, The Knot TV, The Bump TV and The Nest TV.Online advertising includes online banner advertisements and direct e-mail marketing as well as placement in the Company&#8217;s online search tools. This category also includes online listings, including preferred placement and other premium programs in the local area of the Company&#8217;s websites for local wedding and other vendors. Local vendors may purchase online listings through fixed term contracts or open-ended subscriptions.Certain elements of online advertising contracts provide for the delivery of a minimum number of impressions. Impressions are the featuring of a customer&#8217;s advertisement, banner, link or other form of content on the Company&#8217;s sites. The Company recognizes online advertising revenue over the duration of the contracts on a straight-line basis when delivery of impressions is in excess of minimum guarantees. To the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions are not met, the Company is often obligated to extend the period of the contract until the guaranteed impressions are achieved. If this occurs, the Company defers and recognizes the corresponding revenue over the extended period based on impressions delivered.Registry services revenue primarily represents commissions from retailers who participate in the Company\'s registry aggregation service, which offers couples and their guests the opportunity to view multiple registries in one location and for guests to order gifts off of these registries. After the retail partners fulfill and ship the sales orders, the related commissions are contractually earned by us and recognized as revenue. Product returns or exchanges do not materially impact the commissions earned by us. The Company only records net commissions, and not gross revenue and cost of revenue associated with these products, since the Company is not primarily obligated in these transactions, it is not subject to inventory risk and amounts earned are determined using a fixed percentage.Merchandise revenue generally includes the selling price of wedding supplies through the Company&#8217;s websites, as well as related outbound shipping and handling charges since the Company is the primary party obligated in a transaction, is subject to inventory risk and establishes its own pricing and selection of suppliers. Merchandise revenue is recognized when products are shipped to customers, reduced by discounts as well as an allowance for estimated sales returns. Merchandise revenue excludes related sales taxes collected.Publishing revenue primarily includes print advertising revenue derived from the publication of national and regional magazines and guides. This revenue is recognized upon the publication of the related magazines, at which time all material services related to the magazine have been performed. Additionally, publishing revenue is derived from the sale of magazines on newsstands and in bookstores, and from author royalties received related to book publishing contracts. Revenue from the sale of magazines is reduced by an allowance for estimated sales returns. Author royalties have been derived primarily from publisher royalty advances that are recognized as revenue when all the Company&#8217;s contractual obligations have been met, which is typically upon the delivery to, and acceptance by, the publisher of the final manuscript.Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement, primarily online and print advertising sales, are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on their relative selling prices. Selling prices for deliverables that qualify as separate units of accounting are determined using a hierarchy of: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, (2) third-party evidence, and (3) best estimate of selling price. The Company uses best estimate of selling price of its deliverables in allocating consideration to each deliverable since deliverables are typically priced with a wide range of discounts. The Company\'s best estimate of selling price is intended to represent the price at which it would sell the deliverable if the Company were to sell the item regularly on a stand-alone basis. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited to contingent revenue, if any. We evaluate multiple contracts entered into with the same advertiser as these contracts may need to be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement when the economics of the individual contracts cannot be understood without reference to the arrangement as a whole.We evaluate our revenue generating activities to determine whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of sales and related costs or the net amount earned. Generally, when the Company is primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price, otherwise the Company records the net amounts earned. Net amounts earned are generally determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed-payment schedule, or a combination of both.Deferred RevenueDeferred revenue represents payments received or billings in excess of revenue recognized, which are primarily related to online and print advertising contracts.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense totaled$0.7 million,$0.7 millionand$0.5 millionfor the years endedDecember 31, 2014,2013and2012, respectively.Shipping and Handling ChargesMerchandise revenues included outbound shipping and handling charges of$1.9 million,$2.6 millionand$3.0 millionfor the years endedDecember 31, 2014,2013and2012, respectively.Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and investments, and accounts receivable. Although the Company deposits its cash with more thanonemajor financial institution, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on cash and cash equivalent accounts to date and the Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk related to cash.Noindividual foreign country accounted for more than10%of the Company\'s revenue during the years endedDecember 31, 2014,2013or2012.Noindividual foreign country accounted for more than10%of the Company\'s accounts receivable during the years endedDecember 31, 2014or2013. The Company holds fixed assets in the United States and China.Nocountry outside of the United States holds greater than10%of the Company\'s fixed assets.For the years endedDecember 31, 2014,2013and2012,Noindividual customer represented more than10%of net revenue. AtDecember 31, 2014andDecember 31, 2013,noindividual customer accounted for more than10%of accounts receivable. The Company&#8217;s customers are concentrated in the United States. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations, generally does not require collateral, and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the measurement-date fair value of the award. The fair value of restricted stock awarded under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan is determined using the intrinsic value of the stock at the time of grant.The fair value of the stock options granted in 2014 and 2013 from the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model (see Note 4 for further details). Using this model, fair value was calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of the Company\'s stock price, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) expected dividend yield on the Company\'s stock, and (iv) a risk-free interest rate, which is based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the expected term. Specifically, the expected term of the options granted during 2014 and 2013 was determined using the "simplified method" as prescribed by Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") Topic 14D.2, which is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. The simplified method was used to determine the expected term of the options, due to the extended period of time that has lapsed since the Company last granted options, as well as differences in the contractual terms of the option awards compared to options granted in prior periods, such that the Company\'s historical share option experience does not provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term. The Company intends to continue to consistently apply the simplified method until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding exercise data becomes available. The Company did not grant any stock options during the year ended December 31, 2012.The fair value of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;) rights granted from the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (see Note 4 for further details). Using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of the Company\'s stock price, (ii) the expected life of the award, which for ESPP rights is the period of time between the offering date and the exercise date (as defined in Note 4), (iii) expected dividend yield on the Company\'s stock, and (iv) a risk-free interest rate, which is based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the expected term. Expected volatility is calculated using historical prices for the Company\'s stock. The expected dividend yield iszero, as the Company has never paid dividends and currently intends to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of the business.For grants of restricted stock and stock options, the Company records compensation expense based on the fair value of the shares on the grant date over the requisite service period, less estimated forfeitures. Compensation expense for ESPP rights is recorded in line with each respective offering period.Forfeitures of equity awards are estimated at the grant date and reduce the compensation recognized. Estimated forfeitures of equity awards are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. The Company considers several factors when estimating future forfeitures, including types of awards, employee level and historical experience. Actual forfeitures may differ from current estimates.Earnings per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share adjusts basic earnings per share for the effects of stock options, restricted stock, and the Employee Stock Purchase Program (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;), only in the periods in which the effects are dilutive. The accounting standard pertaining to earnings per share precludes the calculation of diluted earnings per share when a net loss is presented. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the diluted computation if their effect is antidilutive. The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year endedDecember 31, 2014excludes a weighted average number of restricted stock and stock options of408,835and219,315, respectively, because to include them in the calculation would be antidilutive. There were101,843and41,397antidilutive restricted stock and stock options for the years ended December 31,2013and2012, respectively.Segment InformationThe Company operates inonereportable segment, as it is organized around its online and offline media and e-commerce service lines. In addition, there is a substantial amount of costs that benefit all service lines, but are not allocated to individual cost of revenue categories. The chief operating decision maker reviews financial information at a consolidated result of operations level in addition to also reviewing revenue and cost of revenue results of the individual service lines.Comprehensive IncomeOther comprehensive loss includes changes in stockholders\' equity that are excluded from net income, specifically, cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive loss is disclosed in a separate statement that immediately follows the Consolidated Statements of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn July 2013, the accounting standard relating to an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists was updated to clarify the balance sheet presentation. This updated standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2013 and early adoption was permitted. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2014. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified approximately $3.1 million from other long-term liabilities to be reflected as a reduction of long-term deferred tax assets.In April 2014, the accounting standard relating to the criteria for reporting discontinued operations was updated, which also expanded the disclosure requirements for disposals. Under the new guidance, a disposal that represents a strategic shift having a major effect on the organization&#8217;s operations and financial results should be presented as discontinued operations. The new guidance also requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations, including more information about the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of a discontinued operation. This updated standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption of the updated standard is permitted but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issue. The Company early adopted this standard during the fourth quarter of 2014. Upon adoption of this policy no disposal activities represented a significant strategic shift that would require discontinued operations presentation.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the accounting standard relating to revenue from contracts with customers was updated to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and develop a common standard for all industries. The new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or cumulative effect approach to adopt the new standard. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements or the method of adoption.In June 2014, the accounting standard relating to performance targets that affect vesting of a share-based payment that could be achieved after the requisite service period was updated. Under the new guidance, these performance targets that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be accounted for as a performance condition and therefore, the target is not reflected in the estimation of the award\'s grant date fair value. This updated standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements since the Company\'s share-based payment awards currently do not contain performance targets that could be achieved after the requisite service period for the award.In August 2014, the accounting standard relating to the evaluation of going concern was updated. Under the final guidance, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide disclosures when certain criteria are met. This updated standard is effective for annual periods beginning December 15, 2016 and for interim reporting periods starting in the first quarter of 2017, and early adoption is permitted.'

S'Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principals in the United States. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include Roadships Holdings, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period.   Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of 3 months or less to be cash equivalents.  The Company maintains its deposits with high quality financial institutions and, accordingly, believes its credit risk exposure associated with cash is remote.  There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. Property, Plant and Equipment We record our property plant and equipment at historical cost.  The estimated useful lives of these assets range from three to seven years and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the asset&#8217;s useful life. Foreign Currency Risk We currently have two subsidiaries operating in Australia.  At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had $294 and $214 Australian Dollars, respectively ($306 and $218 US Dollars, respectively) deposited into Australian banks.  Additionally, we had $0 and $13 dollars on deposit with US banks at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net earnings or loss (the numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period (the denominator). Diluted earnings per common share is similar to the computation for basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased by the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding and unvested restricted shares and share units, computed using the treasury stock method.  There are currently no common stock equivalents.Capital LeasesWe account for capital leases as defined in ASC 840-30  Capital Leases.  Some of the assets of our subsidiary in Australia, Roadships Freight Pty Ltd. (formerly Endeavor Logistics Pty Ltd.) were subject to certain capital lease obligations which we have recognized.  Our Chief Executive Officer, Micheal Nugent, made interest and principal payments on this capital lease obligation which culminated during the year ended December 31, 2011.  As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, these lease obligations have been satisfied.For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, capital lease obligation payments were\r$0 and $1,236, respectively.  Unpaid capital lease obligations were $0 at both December 31, 2012 and 2011. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s (FASB) Accounting Codification Standard No. 820 (&#8220;ASC 820),Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC  820 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:Level 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;Level 2 - Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; andLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.The Following table represents our assets and liabilities at December 31, 2012 by level measured at fair value on a recurring basis:The Following table represents our assets and liabilities at December 31, 2011 by level measured at fair value on a recurring basis:Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered.

S'egxNOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&nbsp;Green Bikes Rental Corporation was incorporated on December 17, 2007, under the laws of the State of Nevada, as a development stage company.&nbsp;On January 7, 2010, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of Green Bikes Rental Corporation to Affinity Mediaworks Corp., to increase the authorized share capital of the Company to 200,000,000 and to affect a 20 for 1 forward-split of the Company&#146;s issued and outstanding common shares.&nbsp;On July 23, 2012 there was a change of control and 40,000,000 shares were transferred from Yulia Nesterchuk to Cortland Communications, LLC.&nbsp;On August 20, 2012 the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada and reclassified the capital stock as 190,000,000 common stock with a par value of $0.00001 and 10,000,000 blank check preferred stock with a par value of $0.00001&nbsp;On September 18, 2012 the Company recorded minutes on a proposed a 1 for 777 reverse stock split. As of the date of this filing the common stock issued and outstanding has been adjusted retroactively back to inception to reflect this change.&nbsp;BASIS OF PRESENTATION&nbsp;The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the periods presented have been reflected herein.&nbsp;REVENUE RECOGNITION&nbsp;Revenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned. Affinity considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been provided, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue that is billed in advance such as recurring weekly or monthly services are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the period the services are provided.&nbsp;USE OF ESTIMATES&nbsp;The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.&nbsp;CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS&nbsp;For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of January 31, 2013 and 2012 there were no cash equivalents.&nbsp;DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY&nbsp;The Company complies with FASB pronouncements for its characterization of the Company as development stage.&nbsp;FAIR VALUE MEASURMENTS&nbsp;The Company adopted FASB ASC Topic 820, &#147;Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure,&#148; at inception. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. FASB ASC Topic 820 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. FASB ASC Topic 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, FASB ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows.&nbsp;&#149; Level 1.  Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets.&#149; Level 2.  Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly, and&#149; Level 3.  Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions&nbsp;The FASB&#146;s ASC Topic 825, &#147;Financial Instruments&#148;, became effective for the Company on January 1, 2008. FASB ASC Topic 825 establishes a fair value option that permits entities to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value options have been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. For the period ended January 31, 2013, there were no applicable items on which the fair value option was elected.&nbsp;BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE&nbsp;Basic and diluted net loss per share calculations are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The per share amounts include the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents in years with net income. Basic and diluted loss per share is the same due to the anti dilutive nature of potential common stock equivalents.&nbsp;RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS&nbsp;In October 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2012-04, &#147;Technical Corrections and Improvements&#148; in Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-04. The amendments in this update cover a wide range of Topics in the Accounting Standards Codification. These amendments include technical corrections and improvements to the Accounting Standards Codification and conforming amendments related to fair value measurements. The amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2012.  The adoption of ASU 2012-04 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.&nbsp;In August 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-03, &#147;Technical Amendments and Corrections to SEC Sections: Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 114, Technical Amendments Pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-9250, and Corrections Related to FASB Accounting Standards Update 2010-22 (SEC Update)&#148; in Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-03. This update amends various SEC paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of SAB No. 114. The adoption of ASU 2012-03 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.&nbsp;In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, &#147;Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment&#148; in Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02. This update amends ASU 2011-08, Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment and permits an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with Subtopic 350-30, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - General Intangibles Other than Goodwill. The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before July 27, 2012, if a public entity&#146;s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or, for nonpublic entities, have not yet been made available for issuance. The adoption of ASU 2012-02 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.&nbsp;In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, &#147;Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income&#148; in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05. This update defers the requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income in both the statement of income where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented. The adoption of ASU 2011-12 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.&nbsp;In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11 &#147;Balance Sheet: Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities&#148; (&#147;ASU 2011-11&#148;). This Update requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The objective of this disclosure is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of U.S. GAAP and those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of IFRS. The amended guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this pronouncement may have on its results of operations or financial position.&nbsp;In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The guidance in ASU 2011-08 is intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit. The amendments also improve previous guidance by expanding upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Also, the amendments improve the examples of events and circumstances that an entity having a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount should consider in determining whether to measure an impairment loss, if any, under the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.  Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entity&#146;s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations.&nbsp;In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, &#147;Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income&#148;, which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. ASU 2011-05 will become effective for the Company on December 1, 2012. This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders&#146; equity. In addition, items of other comprehensive income that are reclassified to profit or loss are required to be presented separately on the face of the financial statements. This guidance is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements by requiring that such amounts be presented either in a single continuous statement of income and comprehensive income or separately in consecutive statements of income and comprehensive income. The adoption of ASU 2011-05 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.&nbsp;In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, &#147;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs&#148;, which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. This guidance amends certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. Additional disclosure requirements in the update include: (1) for Level 3 fair value measurements, quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used by the entity, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs; (2) for an entity&#146;s use of a nonfinancial asset that is different from the asset&#146;s highest and best use, the reason for the difference; (3) for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required, the fair value hierarchy level in which the fair value measurements were determined; and (4) the disclosure of all transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. ASU 2011-04 will become effective for the Company on December 1, 2012. We are currently evaluating ASU 2011-04 and have not yet determined the impact that adoption will have on our financial statements.&nbsp;In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, &#147;Receivables (Topic 310): A Creditor&#146;s Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring&#148;. This amendment explains which modifications constitute troubled debt restructurings (&#147;TDR&#148;). Under the new guidance, the definition of a troubled debt restructuring remains essentially unchanged, and for a loan modification to be considered a TDR, certain basic criteria must still be met. For public companies, the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after June 15, 2011, and applies retrospectively to restructuring occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. ASU 2011-02 has become effective for the Company on September 1, 2012. The Company does not believe that the guidance will have a material impact on its financial statements.'

S"The accompanying\rfinancial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,\rwhich contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.

S"2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Assets and liabilities with reported amounts based on significant estimates include trade accounts receivable, inventory (slow-moving), goodwill, and deferred income taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tandy Leather Factory, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, The Leather Factory, L.P. (a Texas limited partnership) and its corporate partners, Tandy Leather Company, L.P. (a Texas limited partnership) and its corporate partners, Mid-Continent Leather Sales, Inc. (an Oklahoma corporation), Roberts, Cushman &amp; Company, Inc. (a Texas corporation), The Leather Factory of Canada, Ltd. (a Canadian corporation), Tandy Leather Factory UK Limited (a UK corporation), Tandy Leather Factory Australia Pty. Limited (an Australian corporation), and Tandy Leather Factory Espa&ntilde;a, S.L. (a Spanish corporation). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign currency translation adjustments arise from activities of our foreign subsidiaries. Results of operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates during the period, while assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments of assets and liabilities are recorded in stockholders&#x2019; equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reported in the statements of income under the caption &#x201c;Other (Income) Expense&#x201d;, net, for all periods presented. We recognized foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of ($24,000), ($13,900), and $41,000, in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales generally occur via two methods: (1) at the store counter, and (2) shipment by common carrier. Sales at the counter are recorded and title passes as transactions occur. Otherwise, sales are recorded and title passes when the merchandise is shipped to the customer. Shipping terms are normally FOB shipping point. Sales tax and comparable foreign tax is excluded from revenue.&nbsp;We offer an unconditional satisfaction guarantee to all customers and accept all product returns. Net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances, product returns, and allowances for defective merchandise.&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain four price levels on a consistent basis: retail, wholesale, business, and distributor. Gross sales are reported after deduction of discounts. We do not pay slotting fees or make other payments to resellers. Several customers require us to participate in their cooperative advertising programs. These programs are a negotiated percentage of their purchases and are accounted for as a reduction of sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of goods sold includes inbound freight and duty charges from vendors to our central warehouse, freight and handling charges to move merchandise from our central warehouse to our stores, and manufacturing overhead, as appropriate.&nbsp;Operating expenses include all selling, general and administrative costs including wages and related employee expenses (payroll taxes, health benefits, savings plans, etc.), advertising, outbound freight charges (to ship merchandise to customers), rent, and utilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are five to ten years for equipment and machinery, seven to fifteen years for furniture and fixtures, five years for vehicles, and forty years for buildings and related improvements. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or the useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventory is valued at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market. In addition, the value of inventory is periodically reduced to net realizable value for slow-moving or obsolete inventory based on management's review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential impairments of long-lived assets are reviewed annually or when events and circumstances warrant an earlier review. Impairment is determined when estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset are less than the asset&#x2019;s carrying value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share includes, to the extent inclusion of such shares would be dilutive to earnings per share, the effect of outstanding options and warrants, computed using the treasury stock method.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For additional disclosures regarding the restricted stock awards and the employee stock options, see Note 11. The net effect of converting stock options and restricted stock grants to purchase 68,400, 107,001, and 84,600 shares of common stock at option prices less than the average market prices has been included in the computations of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, absent indicators of impairment during the interim. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires exercise of judgment, including the estimation of future cash flows, determination of appropriate discount rates and other important assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated at least annually for impairment. We completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31 for each of the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.&nbsp;A summary of changes in our goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our intangible assets and related accumulated amortization consisted of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding goodwill, we have no intangible assets not subject to amortization under U.S. GAAP. Amortization of intangible assets of $40,744 in 2015, $45,202 in 2014, and $42,305 in 2013 was recorded in operating expenses. The weighted average amortization period is 15 years for trademarks and copyrights. Based on the current amount of intangible assets subject to amortization, we estimate amortization expense as follows for the next five years:&nbsp;&nbsp;We measure fair value as an exit price, which is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As a basis for considering such assumptions, accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:&nbsp;Level 1 &#x2013; observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.&nbsp;Level 2 &#x2013; include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.&nbsp;Level 3 &#x2013; significant unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.&nbsp;Classification of the financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.&nbsp;Our principal financial instruments held consist of certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable, and long-term debt. The carrying value of certificates of deposit, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair value due to the relatively short-term nature of the accounts. The terms of the long-term debt are considered reasonable for this type of financing; therefore, the carrying amount approximates fair value.&nbsp;&nbsp;We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable is accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and the financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities.&nbsp;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes from a change in tax rate is recognized through continuing operations in the period that includes the enactment date of the change. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.&nbsp;A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax position must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized.&nbsp;We recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions and adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense and the effective tax rate in the period in which new information becomes available.&nbsp;We may be subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of our tax positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have one stock option plan which permits annual stock option grants to non-employee directors with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant. Under this plan, no stock options were awarded in 2015 or 2014, while 12,000 options were awarded to directors in 2013. These options vest and become exercisable six months from the option grant date. Options outstanding and exercisable were granted at a stock option price which was not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date the option was granted and no option has a term in excess of ten years. We recognized share based compensation expense of $0, $0, and $11,686 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, as a component of operating expenses.&nbsp;See Note 11 for additional information related to our stock option plan.&nbsp;We also have a restricted stock plan that was adopted by our Board of Directors in January 2013 and approved by our stockholders in June 2013. The plan reserves up to 300,000 shares of our common stock for restricted stock awards to our executive officers, non-employee directors, and other key employees. Awards granted under the plan may be stock awards or performance awards, and may be subject to a graded vesting schedule with a minimum vesting period of four years. The fair value of nonvested restricted common stock awards is the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation costs for these awards will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the four year vesting period.&nbsp;See Note 11 for additional information regarding our restricted stock plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive income includes net income and certain other items that are recorded directly to Stockholders&#x2019; Equity. The Company&#x2019;s only source of other comprehensive income is foreign currency translation adjustments.&nbsp;&nbsp;All shipping and handling costs incurred by us are included in operating expenses on the statements of income. These costs totaled approximately $2,012,000, $2,046,000, and $1,978,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of catalog costs, advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Catalog costs are capitalized and expensed over the estimated useful life of the particular catalog in question, which is typically twelve to eighteen months. Such capitalized costs are included in other current assets and totaled $181,000 and $171,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total advertising expense was $4,826,000 in 2015; $4,339,000 in 2014; and $4,099,000 in 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of the statement of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation."

S'1.           SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES   DGT Holdings Corp. (formerly Del Global Technologies Corp.) together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221;), was, as of July 28, 2012, in one line of business: the Power Conversion Group.  The Power Conversion Group segment designs, manufactures and markets key electronic components such as transformers, noise suppression filters and high voltage capacitors for use in precision regulated high voltage applications.  These activities are performed principally by the Company&#8217;s RFI Corporation (&#8220;RFI&#8221;) subsidiary. See Note 16 for a description of certain significant subsequent events.In fiscal year 2010, the Board of the Company decided to exit the Del Medical Imaging U.S. business unit (&#8220;DMI&#8221;).  The business was sold on November 24, 2009.  It is reflected as a discontinued operation in the financial statements of the Company and prior years have been restated (see Note 2).  This business was part of the Company&#8217;s Medical Systems Group.In August 2011, the Company decided to exit the Medical Systems Group by selling its Italian subsidiary, Villa Sistemi Medicali S.p.A. (&#8220;Villa&#8221;).  The business was sold on November 3, 2011 and is reflected as a discontinued operation in the financial statements of the Company.  Prior period financial statements have also been restated to reflect this presentation (see Note 2).DGT Holdings currently has a real estate business.  The Company&#8217;s business is expected to consist primarily of capital redeployment and identification of new profitable operations where it can utilize its existing working capital and maximize the use of the Company&#8217;s net operating losses.PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, which conforms to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated balance sheets, as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for obsolete and excess inventory, realizability of deferred income tax assets, recoverability of intangibles and other long-lived assets, and future obligations associated with the Company&#8217;s litigation.Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years&#8217; amounts to conform to the current year&#8217;s presentation.We have evaluated subsequent events through the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;).ACCOUNTING PERIOD - The Company&#8217;s fiscal year-end is based on a 52/53-week cycle ending on the Saturday nearest to July 31. Results of Villa were consolidated into the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements based on a fiscal year that ended on June 30 and were reported on a one-month lag through its November 3, 2011 sale date.CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers highly liquid instruments readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less (measured from their acquisition date) to be cash equivalents.INVESTMENTS Publicly traded investments are classified as available-for-sale (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) or trading securities and recorded at fair value.  For AFS securities, we record unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value between measurement dates as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of shareholders&#8217; equity, except when we consider declines in value to be other than temporary.FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The financial statements of Villa were recorded in euro and translated into U.S. dollars.  Villa&#8217;s balance sheet accounts were translated at the current exchange rate and income statement items were translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Gains and losses resulting from translation were accumulated in a separate component of shareholders&#8217; equity.  Other than as related to the note receivable received as part of the proceeds on the sale and Villa&#8217;s operating facility, which the Company retained after the sale of Villa, all foreign currency adjustments included in shareholders&#8217; equity were eliminated upon the November 3, 2011 sale of Villa and are included in the gain on such sale.INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is comprised of direct materials and, where applicable, direct labor costs and overhead that has been incurred in getting the inventories to their present location and condition. Engineering costs incurred to set up products to be manufactured for a customer purchase order are capitalized when the scope of the purchase order indicates that such costs are recoverable. Such costs are included in work-in-process inventory and amortized on a units shipped basis over the life of the customer order from the date of first shipment. Cost is calculated using the first in, first out method. Market value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET   Property, plant and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Replacements and major improvements are capitalized; maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Gains or losses on asset dispositions are included in the determination of net income or loss. Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the term of the lease.Depreciable lives are generally as follows:DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS, NET - Financing costs, including fees, commission and legal expenses, are capitalized as other non-current assets and amortized on a straight line basis, which approximates the interest method, over the term or expected term of the relevant loan. Amortization of deferred financing costs is included in interest expense.RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - The Company evaluates the carrying amounts of long-lived assets whenever events have occurred (and at least annually for goodwill, if any) which might require modification to the carrying values. In evaluating carrying values of long-lived assets, the Company reviews certain indicators of potential impairment, such as undiscounted projected cash flows and business plans. In the event that impairment has occurred, the estimated fair value of the related asset is determined and the Company records a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset&#8217;s carrying value to the estimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value based on the best information available making whatever estimates, judgments and projections are considered necessary.REVENUE RECOGNITION   The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment, provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, there are no uncertainties concerning acceptance, the sales price is fixed, collection of the receivable is probable and only perfunctory obligations related to the arrangement need to be completed. The Company&#8217;s products are covered primarily by one year warranty plans and in some cases optional extended warranties for up to five years are offered. The Company establishes allowances for warranties on an aggregate basis for specifically identified, as well as anticipated, warranty claims based on contractual terms, product conditions and actual warranty experience by product line. The Company recognizes service revenue when repairs or out of warranty repairs are completed.  These repairs are billed to the customers at market rates.  The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of their accounts receivable and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is not certain.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS - Research and development costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.INCOME TAXES - Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represents the effects of the differences between the income tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and tax credit carryforwards at the tax rates expected at the time the deferred income tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. Management provides valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets for which realization does not meet a &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; standard.NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE   Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The effect of the assumed exercise of options and issuance of restricted shares are included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share unless their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, trade receivables and lines of credit. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company limits its credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and, when necessary, requiring letters of credit, guarantees or collateral. Management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the Company&#8217;s concentrations of credit at July 28, 2012.The activity in allowances for doubtful accounts is as follows:STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award.  That cost will be recognized over the period in which the employee is required to provide the services&#8212;the requisite service period (usually the vesting period)   in exchange for the award.  The grant date fair value for options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models.  The Company is required to select a valuation technique or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard, which includes a binomial model and the Black-Scholes model.  At the present time, the Company is continuing to use the Black-Scholes model for stock option grants.EFFECTS OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSAccounting standards that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8221;FASB&#8221;) or other standard setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.In May 2011, the &#8220;FASB amended its guidance related to fair value measurements in order to align the definition of fair value measurements and the related disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.  These amendments, which are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, also change certain existing fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements.  We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements.In June 2011, the FASB amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income.  The new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either (1) a continuous statement of comprehensive income or (2) two separate but consecutive statements.  The provisions of this new guidance are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2011.  We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial statements.'

S'Recently Issued Accounting StandardsOn November 20, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities&#8217; processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. We elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Prior periods in our Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted.In May 2014, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") issued their final standard on revenue from contracts with customers.  The standard, issued as ASU 2014-09 "Revenue From Contracts with Customers" by the FASB, outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  Compared with current GAAP, the ASU requires significantly expanded disclosures about revenue recognition.  The ASU is effective for Century for our fiscal year 2018 and thereafter.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.'

S'Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. This ASU states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with Codification Subtopic 350-30, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other, General Intangibles Other than Goodwill. Under the guidance in this ASU, an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. An entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before July 27, 2012, if a public entity&#8217;s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or, for nonpublic entities, have not yet been made available for issuance.The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption will have on its financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12,Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.The amendments of this ASU are effective at the same time as the amendments in ASU No. 2011-05,Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentation requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 that ASU No. 2011-12 is deferring. All other requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 are not affected by ASU No. 2011-12, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. Public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. Nonpublic entities should begin applying these requirements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2012, and interim and annual periods thereafter. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption will have on its financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11,Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.Offsetting, otherwise known as netting, is the presentation of assets and liabilities as a single net amount in the statement of financial position (balance sheet). Unlike IFRS, U.S. GAAP allows companies the option to present net in their balance sheets derivatives that are subject to a legally enforceable netting arrangement with the same party where rights of set-off are only available in the event of default or bankruptcy. To address these differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, in January 2011 the FASB and the IASB (the Boards) issued an exposure draft that proposed new criteria for netting that were narrower than the current conditions currently in U.S. GAAP. Nevertheless, in response to feedback from their respective stakeholders, the Boards decided to retain their existing offsetting models. Instead, the Boards have issued common disclosure requirements related to offsetting arrangements to allow investors to better compare financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP.ASU 2011-11 requires an entityto disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. An entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented.The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption will have on its financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-10,Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Derecognition of in Substance Real Estate-a Scope Clarification. ASU No. 2011-10 represents the consensus reached in EITF Issue No. 10-E,"Derecognition of in Substance Real Estate."The objective of this ASU is to resolve the diversity in practice about whether the guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic 360-20,&#8220;Property, Plant, and Equipment &#8212; Real Estate Sales,&#8221;applies to a parent that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary&#8217;s nonrecourse debt. ASU 2011-10 provides that when a parent (reporting entity) ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary&#8217;s nonrecourse debt, the reporting entity should apply the guidance in Codification Subtopic 360-20 to determine whether it should derecognize the in substance real estate. Generally, a reporting entity would not satisfy the requirements to derecognize the in substance real estate before the legal transfer of the real estate to the lender and the extinguishment of the related nonrecourse indebtedness. That is, even if the reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest under Subtopic 810-10, the reporting entity would continue to include the real estate, debt, and the results of the subsidiary&#8217;s operations in its consolidated financial statements until legal title to the real estate is transferred to legally satisfy the debt. ASU 2011-10 should be applied on a prospective basis to deconsolidation events occurring after the effective date; with prior periods not adjusted even if the reporting entity has continuing involvement with previously derecognized in substance real estate entities. For public entities, ASU 2011-10 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2012. For nonpublic entities, ASU 2011-10 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2013, and interim and annual periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted.The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption will have on its financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05,Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.This ASU allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders\' equity. The amendments to the Codification in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. ASU 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively. For public entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. For nonpublic entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2012, and interim and annual periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption will have on its financial statements.'

S"Note 1   Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations We distribute healthcare products and services primarily to office-based healthcare practitionerswithoperationsor affiliatesin the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR,Iceland,Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg,Mauritius,the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkeyand the United Kingdom.Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry Schein, Inc. and all of our controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are greater than or equal to20% and less than or equal to50% owned or investments in unconsolidated affiliates of less than20% in which we have the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method.  See Note6for accounting treatment of Redeemablenoncontrollinginterests.  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.Fiscal Year We report our results of operations and cash flows on a52-53week basis ending on the lastSaturday of December.  The yearendedDecember 29, 2012consisted of 52weeks, the year ended December 31, 2011consisted of 53 weeksand the year endedDecember 25, 2010consisted of 52weeks.Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and animal health consumable products, as well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized. Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume,low-dollar orders shipped using third-party common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the product price is fixed and determinable,collectionof the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and product returns are reasonably estimable.Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is typically completed at the time of delivery. Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the services are provided. Revenue derived from multiple element arrangements, and the related deferral of such revenue (which is insignificant to our financial statements), is recognized as follows. When we sell software products together with related services (i.e., training and technical support) we allocate revenue to the delivered elements using the residual method, based upon vendor-specific objective evidence (&#8220;VSOE&#8221;) of the fair value of the undelivered elements, or defer it until such time as vendor-specific evidence of fair value is obtained. Multiple element arrangements that include elements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation service. Effective December 26, 2010 we allocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the elements applying the following hierarchy: first VSOE, then third-party evidence (&#8220;TPE&#8221;) of selling price if VSOE is not available, and finally our estimate of the selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. VSOE exists when we sell the deliverables separately and represents the actual price charged by us for each deliverable. Estimated selling price reflects our best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business, technical skill required, customer location and other market conditions. Each element that has standalone value is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting. Revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized when the service is provided or the product is delivered. Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided.Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.Due to the short-term maturity of such investments, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit of $59.4million and $49.1million, primarily related to payments for inventory, were classified as accounts payable as ofDecember 29, 2012andDecember 31, 2011.Available-for-sale Securities As ofDecember 29, 2012, we have approximately $3.3million($2.8million net of temporary impairments)invested in auction-rate securities (&#8220;ARS&#8221;).  These investments are backed by student loans (backed by the federal government) and investments in closed-end municipal bond funds, which are included as part of Investments and other within our consolidated balance sheets.  ARS are publicly issued securities that represent long-term investments, typically10-30years, in which interest rates had reset periodically (typically every7,28or35days) through a &#8220;dutch auction&#8221; process. We determine cost of investments in available-for-sale securities on a specific identification basis.  As ofDecember 29, 2012andDecember 31, 2011, unrealized losses, which are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income within the equity section of our consolidated balance sheets, on our available-for-sale securities totaled $0.5million and $1.2million, respectively.  Gross realized gains and losses were immaterial in all periods presented.Accounts Receivable and Reserves The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected.  The reserve for accounts receivable is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns.  In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends.From time to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectability.Inventories and Reserves Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and high tech equipment.  In accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.  From time to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect the value of inventory.Direct Shipping and Handling Costs Freight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales.  Direct handling costs, which represent primarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise prepare, if necessary, merchandise for shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Direct shipping and handling costs were $63.8million, $61.8million and $57.0million for the years endedDecember 29, 2012,December 31, 2011andDecember 25, 2010.Advertising and Promotional Costs We generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred.  Total advertising and promotional expenses were $10.4million, $13.1million and $12.7million for the years endedDecember 29, 2012,December 31, 2011andDecember 25, 2010.  Additionally, advertising and promotional costs incurred in connection with direct marketing, including product catalogs and printed material, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period which is benefited, generally not exceeding one year.  As ofDecember 29, 2012andDecember 31, 2011, we had $3.5million and $4.2million of deferred direct marketing expenses included in other current assets.Supplier Rebates Supplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized over the period they are earned.  The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales, in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms, which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume.Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization.Depreciation is computed primarily under the straight-line method (see Note2-Property and Equipment, Net for estimated useful lives).Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the lease term. Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software.  Costs incurred during the application development stage for software bought and further customized by outside suppliers for our use and software developed by a supplier for our proprietary use are capitalized.  Costs incurred for our own personnel who are directly associated with software development are capitalized.Income Taxes We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns.  In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates.  The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates will be recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.  We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries.Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.  Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end.  Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year.  Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings.Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our objective is to manage the impact that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have on recognized asset and liability fair values, earnings and cash flows.  Our risk management policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be effective at reducing the risks associated with the exposure being hedged and be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.  We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.  Our derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency forward agreements related to certain intercompany loans and certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with foreign suppliers. Our foreign currency forward agreements related to forecasted inventory purchase commitments are designated as cash flow hedges.  Our foreign currency forward agreements related to foreign currency balance sheet exposure provide economic hedges but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. For agreements not designated as hedges, changes in the value of the derivative, along with the transaction gain or loss on the hedged item, are recorded in earnings.  For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative, along with any gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We classify the cash flows related to our hedging activities in the same category on our consolidated statements of cash flows as the cash flows related to the hedged item.Acquisitions The net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date and our consolidated financial statements include their results of operations from that date.  Any excess of acquisition consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.The major classes of assets and liabilities that we generally allocate purchase price to, excluding goodwill, include identifiable intangible assets (i.e., trademarks and trade names, customer relationships and lists and non-compete agreements), property, plant and equipment, deferred taxes and other current and long-term assets and liabilities.The estimated fair value of identifiable intangibleassets is based on critical estimates, judgments and assumptions derived from: analysis of market conditions;discount rate;discounted cash flows; customer retention rates; andestimated useful lives.Some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain financial targets are met.  For acquisitions completed prior to 2009, we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe that the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt.For 2009 and future acquisitions, we accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of additional purchase price adjustments at the time of acquisition.  Any adjustments to these accruals are recorded in our consolidated statement of income.For the yearsendedDecember 29, 2012, December 31, 2011and December 25, 2010, there were no material adjustments recorded in our consolidated statement of income relating to changes in estimated contingent purchase price liabilities.RedeemableNoncontrollingInterests Some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, at certain times, to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entitiesat fair value.Their interests in these subsidiaries are classified outside permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets and are carried at the estimated redemption amounts.Theredemption amounts have been estimated based onexpectedfutureearningsand cash flowand, if such earningsand cash floware not achieved, the value of the redeemablenoncontrollinginterests might be impacted.Changes in the estimated redemption amounts of thenoncontrollinginterests subject to put options arereflectedat each reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.  Future reductions in the carrying amounts are subject to a &#8220;floor&#8221; amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemablenoncontrollinginterests at the time they were originally recorded.  The recorded value of the redeemablenoncontrollinginterests cannot go below the floor level.  These adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per share.Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually.  Such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units.  We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: health care distribution (globaldental, medical and animal health) and technology and value-added services. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update 2011-08, &#8220;Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2011-08&#8221;),which allows us to use qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values.The factors that we considerin developing our qualitative assessment included: Macroeconomic conditions consisting of the overall sales growth of our business and the overall sales growth of each of our operating segments.  We also considerour growth in market share in the markets in which we compete; Credit markets and our ability to access debt facilities at favorable terms; Key personnel and management expertise, as well as our growth strategies for the next several years; and Our expectations of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit.Prior to the adoption of ASU 2011-08, measuring fair value of a reporting unit was generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings.  Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis.  Our impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangiblesconsists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets.  This comparison is made based ona review of historical, current and forecasted sales and gross profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment.For certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash flows, is utilized.We assessedthe potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually (at the beginning of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  There were no events or circumstances from the date of that assessment through December 29, 2012that impacted our analysis. Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business (e.g., decision to divest a business); or significantnegative industry or economic trends. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income. Beginning with the first quarter of 2012, wechanged our reporting units from dental, medical, animal health, international and technology to global dental, global medical, global animal health and global technology and value-added services. These groups have been formed to provide distinct organizational focus for reaching and serving each practitioner segment with the benefits of a global perspective, as well as global product and service offerings and best practices.  In connection with this change in business groups, goodwill was reallocated to the new reporting units.Based upon this change, we felt it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment, in addition to a qualitative assessment,of goodwill impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter for the year ended December 29, 2012 in order to establish a new baseline calculation. For the yearsendedDecember 29, 2012, December 31, 2011and December 25, 2010, the results of our goodwill impairmentanalysisdid not result in any impairments.Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets. Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property.For long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows.  We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value.  When an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.Cost of Sales The primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product (net of purchase discounts, supplierchargebacksand rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges.  Costs related to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing, internal inventory transfers and other costs of our distribution network are included in selling, general and administrative expenses along with other operating costs. As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.Total distribution network costs were $59.2million, $58.8million and $57.0million for the years endedDecember 29, 2012,December 31, 2011andDecember 25, 2010.Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders' equity.  Our comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains (losses) on hedging and investment activity and pension adjustments."

S'(2)Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesEstimates and AssumptionsThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, whichrequires management to consolidate company financial information and make informed estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant estimates in the Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements relate to allowance for doubtful accounts, self-insured liability risks, income taxes, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, and other contingencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual results could differ from those estimates.&nbsp;Net Revenues and Accounts Receivable&nbsp;Revenues and accounts receivable are recorded on an accrual basis as services are performed at their estimated net realizable value. The Company derives a majority of its revenue from funds under federal Medicare and state Medicaid assistance programs, the continuation of which is dependent upon governmental policies and is subject to audit risk and potential recoupment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also receives payments through reimbursement from Medicaid and Medicare programs and directly from individual residents (private pay), third-party insurers and long-term care facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company assesses collectibility on all accounts prior to providing services.&nbsp;The Company records revenue for inpatient services and the related receivables in the accounting records at the Company&#x2019;s established billing rates in the period the related services are rendered.&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for contractual adjustments, which represents the differences between the established billing rates and predetermined reimbursement rates, is deducted from gross revenue to determine net revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Retroactive adjustments that are likely to result from future examinations by third party payors are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted as necessary in future periods based upon new information or final settlements.&nbsp;The Company records revenue for rehabilitation therapy services and other ancillary services and the related receivables at the time services or products are provided or delivered to the customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon delivery of products or services, the Company has no additional performance obligation to the customer.&nbsp;Cash and Cash Equivalents&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and therefore, approximate fair value. The Company&#x2019;s available cash is held in accounts at commercial banking institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restricted Cash and Investments in Marketable Securities&nbsp;Restricted cash includes cash and money market funds principally held by the Company&#x2019;s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiaries, which are substantially restricted to securing outstanding claims losses.&nbsp;&nbsp;The restricted cash and investments in marketable securities balances at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were$198.1million and$146.7million, respectively.&nbsp;Restricted investments in marketable securities, comprisedprincipallyof fixed interest rate securities, are considered to be available-for-sale and accordingly are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax effects, included within accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders&#x2019; deficit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair values for fixed interest rate securities are based on quoted market prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;A decline in the market value of any security below cost that is deemed other-than-temporary is charged to income, resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security.&nbsp;&nbsp;Realized gains and losses for securities classified as available for sale are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowance for Doubtful Accounts&nbsp;The Company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts by estimating allowance requirement percentages for each accounts receivable aging category for each type of payor.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed estimated allowance requirement percentages by utilizing historical collection trends and its understanding of the nature and collectibility of receivables in the various aging categories and the various lines of the Company&#x2019;s business.&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance percentages are developed by payor type as the accounts receivable from each payor type have unique characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for doubtful accounts also considers accounts specifically identified as uncollectible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable that Company management specifically estimates to be uncollectible, based upon the age of the receivables, the results of collection efforts, or other circumstances, are reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts until written-off.&nbsp;Property and Equipment&nbsp;Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets, which generally range from20-35years for buildings, building improvements and land improvements, and3-15years for equipment, furniture and fixtures and information systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation expense on leasehold improvements and assets held under capital leases is calculated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures for maintenance and repairs necessary to maintain property and equipment in efficient operating condition are expensed as incurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs of additions and betterments are capitalized.&nbsp;&nbsp;Total depreciation expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was$218.8million,$184.3million, and$179.4million, respectively.Identifiable Intangible Assets and GoodwillDefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of management contracts, customer relationships and favorable leases.&nbsp;&nbsp;These assets are amortized in accordance with the authoritative guidance for intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of trade names.Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations.&nbsp;See Note 9 &#x2013; &#x201C;Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets.&#x201D;Impairment of Long-Lived Assets&nbsp;The Company&#x2019;s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.&nbsp;The Company performs an assessment of qualitative factors prior to the use of the two step quantitative method to determine if goodwill has been impaired.&nbsp;&nbsp;If such qualitative assessment does not indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting is less than its carrying value, no further analysis is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;If required, the Company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test which involves a two-step process. The first step is a comparison of each reporting unit&#x2019;s fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment for its reporting units as of September 30 of each year or more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Note 18 &#x2013; &#x201C;Asset Impairment Charges.&#x201D;&nbsp;Self-Insurance Risks&nbsp;The Company provides for self-insurance risks for both general and professional liability and workers&#x2019; compensation claims based on estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not reported claims are accrued based on the Company&#x2019;s estimates of the ultimate costs of the claims, which includes costs associated with litigating or settling claims, and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;All relevant information, including the Company&#x2019;s own historical experience, the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents, and independent actuarial analyses of this information is used in estimating the expected amount of claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reserves for loss for workers&#x2019; compensation risks are discounted based on actuarial estimates of claim payment patterns whereas the reserves for general and professional liability are recorded on an undiscounted basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also considers amounts that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers in estimating the ultimate net liability for such risks.&nbsp;See Note 20 &#x2013; &#x201C;Commitments and Contingencies &#x2013; Loss Reserves For Certain Self-Insured Programs &#x2013; General and Professional Liability and Workers&#x2019; Compensation.&#x201D;&nbsp;Income TaxesThe Company&#x2019;s effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with applicable guidance on accounting for income taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases on recorded assets and liabilities. Accounting guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance, when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management&#x2019;s best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the Company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period.The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, its ability to realize deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are its forecast of pre-tax earnings, its forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of its reserves, its effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of cash and result in an increase in the effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the Company&#x2019;s effective tax rate in the year of resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations.&nbsp;Leases&nbsp;Leasing transactions are a material part of the Company&#x2019;s business. The following discussion summarizes various aspects of the Company&#x2019;s accounting for leasing transactions and the related balances.&nbsp;Capital Leases&nbsp;Lease arrangements are capitalized when such leases convey substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital leases are amortized over either the lease term or the life of the related assets, depending upon available purchase options and lease renewal features.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amortization related to capital lease assets is included in the consolidated statements of operations within depreciation and amortization expense.&nbsp;See Note 11 &#x2013; &#x201C;Lease and Lease Commitments.&#x201D;&nbsp;Operating Leases&nbsp;For operating leases, minimum lease payments, including minimum scheduled rent increases, are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease terms and any periods during which the Company has use of the property but is not charged rent by a landlord.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lease terms, in most cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options.&nbsp;When the Company purchases businesses that have operating lease agreements, it recognizes the fair value of the lease arrangements as either favorable or unfavorable and records these amounts as other identifiable intangible assets or other long-term liabilities, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Favorable and unfavorable leases are amortized to lease expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the leases.&nbsp;&nbsp;See Note 11 &#x2013; &#x201C;Lease and Lease Commitments.&#x201D;&nbsp;Sale/Leaseback Financing Obligation&nbsp;Prior to recognition as a sale, or profit/loss thereon, sale/leaseback transactions are evaluated to determine if their terms transfer all of the risks and rewards of ownership as demonstrated by the absence of any other continuing involvement by the seller-lessee.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sale/leaseback transaction that does not qualify for sale/leaseback accounting because of any form of continuing involvement by the seller-lessee is accounted for as a financing transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the financing method: (1) the assets and accumulated depreciation remain on the consolidated balance sheet and continue to be depreciated over the remaining useful lives; (2) no gain is recognized; and (3) proceeds received by the Company from these transactions are recorded as a financing obligation.&nbsp;&nbsp;See Note 12 &#x2013; &#x201C;Financing Obligations.&#x201D;&nbsp;Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share&nbsp;Earnings (loss) per common share are based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the respective periods. The Company follows the provisions of the authoritative guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities for purposes of calculating earnings per common share.&nbsp;&nbsp;See Note 5 &#x2013; &#x201C;Earnings (Loss) Per Share.&#x201D;&nbsp;Stock-Based Compensation&nbsp;The Company recognizes compensation expense related to stock-based compensation awards in accordance with the related authoritative guidance. See Note 14 &#x2013; &#x201C;Stock-Based Compensation.&#x201D;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent Accounting Pronouncements&nbsp;In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (ASU 2014-09) which changes the requirements for recognizing revenue when entities enter into contracts with customers. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services. It also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is still evaluating the effect, if any, ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.&nbsp;In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,Consolidation (Topic 810):&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis(ASU 2015-02), which changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a variable interest entity (VIE), and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. It also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. The new guidance excludes money market funds that are required to comply with Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and similar entities from the U.S. GAAP consolidation requirements. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. If adopted in an interim period, this ASU must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.&nbsp;&nbsp;The adoption of ASU No. 2015-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.&nbsp;In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, (ASU 2015-03) and in August 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-15,Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements(ASU 2015-15).&nbsp;&nbsp;ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs will continue to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.&nbsp;&nbsp;While ASU 2015-03 addresses costs related to term debt, ASU No. 2015-15 provides clarification regarding costs to secure revolving lines of credit, which are, at the outset, not associated with an outstanding borrowing. ASU 2015-15 provides commentary that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortizing them ratably over the term of the revolving debt arrangement. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. This ASU requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;The adoption of ASU 2015-03 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.&nbsp;In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments(ASU 2015-16), which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is still evaluating the effect, if any, ASU 2015-16 will have on the Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.&nbsp;In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes(ASU 2015-17), which changes how deferred taxes are classified on organizations&#x2019; balance sheets. ASU 2015-17 eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. As permitted by ASU 2015-17, the Company early-adopted this standard and applied it retrospectively to all periods presented.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption of ASU 2015-17 resulted in a reclassification of the Company&#x2019;s current deferred income taxes to noncurrent deferred income taxes in its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.&nbsp;In February 2016, the FASB issued amended authoritative guidance on accounting for leases. The new provisions require that a lessee of operating leases recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments, with the right-of-use asset based upon the lease liability. The classification criteria for distinguishing between finance (or capital) leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the previous lease guidance, but with no explicit bright lines. As such, operating leases will result in straight-line rent expense similar to current practice. For short term leases (term of 12 months or less), a lessee is permitted to make an accounting election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities, which would generally result in lease expense being recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparable period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition. The adoption of this standard is expected to have a material impact on the Company&#x2019;s financial position. The Company is still evaluating the impact on its results of operations and there is no impact on liquidity.&nbsp;'

S'Basis of PresentationThe Company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company&#x2019;s fiscal year ends on December&#xA0;31.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.&#xA0;Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and UncertaintiesFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are primarily deposited in demand and money market accounts. At times, such deposits may be in excess of insured limits. Investments in money market funds are not considered to be bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance company or other government agency. These money market funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at $1.00 per share; however, it is possible to lose money investing in these funds. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash, cash equivalents or restricted cash.Most of the products developed by the Company will require approval from the U.S.&#xA0;Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or corresponding foreign regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales. There can be no assurance the Company&#x2019;s products will receive the necessary approvals. If the Company is denied approval or approval is delayed, it will have a material adverse impact on the Company.The medical device industry is characterized by frequent and extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights. Whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often difficult to predict, and the outcome may be uncertain until the court has entered final judgment and all appeals are exhausted. The Company&#x2019;s competitors may assert that its products or the use of the Company&#x2019;s products are covered by U.S. or foreign patents held by them.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsCarrying amounts of certain of the Company&#x2019;s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The fair values of investments in debt and equity securities are disclosed in Note 3. The fair value of the Company&#x2019;s long-term debt is approximately $10.0 million as of December&#xA0;31, 2012 based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with borrowing rates available to the Company. If measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers highly liquid investments generally with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value. The Company&#x2019;s cash equivalents are primarily in money market funds and certificates of deposit. The Company deposits its cash and cash equivalents in high-quality credit&#xA0;institutions. Under terms of the Company&#x2019;s notes payable agreements (see Note 7), in the event of default, the lender has the right to enforce account control agreements and restrict the Company&#x2019;s access to their cash and investment accounts.Restricted CashThe Company had $200,000 in a cash collateral money market account as of December&#xA0;31, 2012 and 2011. Pursuant to the Lease Agreement the Company entered into with Roseville Properties Management Company in July 2008, the Company was required to deliver to Roseville Properties an irrevocable, unconditional, standby letter of credit in the amount of $200,000 on the second anniversary of the commencement of lease payments. The standby letter of credit is to be maintained through October&#xA0;1, 2013. The irrevocable standby letter of credit was issued by Silicon Valley Bank, who required the Company to set up a restricted cash collateral money market account to fully secure the standby letter of credit.&#xA0;Short-Term InvestmentsThe Company considers all investments with maturities greater than three months and less than one year at the time of purchase as short-term investments and classifies them as either available for sale or held to maturity. The Company also considers certain investments with maturities greater than one year but which are also held for liquidity purposes and are available for sale as short-term investments.Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices, with the unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income within stockholders&#x2019; equity (deficit) in the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest and other income. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.Short-term investments in debt securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at cost, adjusted for premiums and discounts that are recognized in interest income, using the interest method, over the period to maturity. Unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities reflecting a decline in value determined to be other than temporary are charged to income.InventoryThe Company accounts for inventory at the lower of cost or market and records any long-term inventory as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Property and Equipment, NetProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of their useful life or the term of the lease. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment by comparison of the carrying amounts to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset&#x2019;s fair value or estimates of future discounted cash flows. The Company has not identified any such impairment losses to date.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against the gross deferred tax assets as of December&#xA0;31, 2012 and 2011 (see Note 10). The Company&#x2019;s policy is to classify interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.Comprehensive LossComprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investment owners and distributions to owners. The difference from reported net loss for the years ended December&#xA0;31, 2012 and 2011 related entirely to changes in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments. There was no difference from reported net loss for the year ended December&#xA0;31, 2010.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title or risk of loss has passed, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. The Company sells products internationally through distributors and recognizes revenue upon sale to the distributor as these sales are considered to be final and no right of return or price protection exists. Terms of sales to international distributors are generally EXW, reflecting that goods are shipped &#x201C;ex works,&#x201D; in which risk of loss is assumed by the distributor at the shipping point. The Company does not provide for rights of return to customers on product sales and therefore does not record a provision for returns.Research and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development expenses include, but are not limited to, product development, clinical trial expenses, including supplies, devices, explants and revisions, regulatory expenses, payroll and other personnel expenses, materials and consulting costs.Patent CostsCosts associated with the submission of a patent application are expensed as incurred given the uncertainty of the patents resulting in probable future economic benefits to the Company. Patent-related legal expenses included in general and administrative costs were $278,987, $271,105 and $306,181 for the years ended December&#xA0;31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $2,443,269 for the period from December&#xA0;19, 2002 (inception) to December&#xA0;31, 2012.Derivative InstrumentsThe Company accounts for outstanding warrants that are not indexed to the Company&#x2019;s stock or warrants issued when the Company has insufficient authorized and unissued stock available to share settle the outstanding warrants as derivative instruments, which require that the warrants be classified as a liability and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings and recorded separately in the consolidated statements of operations.Effective January&#xA0;1, 2009, the Company adopted new authoritative accounting guidance regarding the financial reporting for outstanding equity-linked financial instruments. As a result of this change in accounting guidance, the Company assessed any outstanding equity-linked financial instruments and concluded that warrants issued in November 2008 with a recorded value of $1.4 million on December&#xA0;31, 2008 were to be reclassified from equity to a liability. The cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on January&#xA0;1, 2009 was a $130,968 increase to the deficit accumulated during development stage. See Note 7 for details.Stock-Based CompensationPrior to January&#xA0;1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method and recognized the expense over the option vesting period. The intrinsic value method is calculated as the difference, if any, between the fair value of the Company&#x2019;s stock and the exercise price on the date of the grant. The Company also followed the minimum value disclosure provisions.Effective January&#xA0;1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for share-based payments, which superseded the previous accounting method, and requires compensation expense to be recognized using a fair-value-based method for costs related to all share-based payments including stock options. Companies are required to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The Company adopted the new provisions using the prospective transition method, which requires that for nonpublic entities that used the minimum value method for either pro forma or financial statement recognition purposes, to apply the new accounting provisions only to option grants or modifications to existing options that occur after the required effective date. For options granted prior to January&#xA0;1, 2006, the Company has continued to apply the intrinsic value provisions on any remaining unvested awards. All option grants valued after January&#xA0;1, 2006 are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.The fair value method is applied to all share-based payment awards issued to employees and where appropriate, nonemployees, unless another source of literature applies. When determining the measurement date of a nonemployee&#x2019;s share-based payment award, the Company measures the stock options at fair value and remeasures such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached.Net Loss Per ShareBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period plus dilutive potential common shares calculated using the treasury stock method. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to reduce a net loss per share. The Company&#x2019;s potential dilutive shares, which include outstanding common stock options, unvested common shares subject to repurchase and warrants, have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for all periods as the result would be anti-dilutive.&#xA0;The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended December&#xA0;31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:&#xA0;The following table sets forth the potential shares of common stock that are not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would be anti-dilutive as of the end of each period presented:&#xA0;Recently Issued Accounting StandardsIn June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements. Entities are required to present total comprehensive income either in a single, continuous statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. The Company adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2012 and presents net loss and other comprehensive loss in two separate, but consecutive, statements. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company&#x2019;s financial statement disclosures.There have been no other significant changes in recent accounting pronouncements during the year ended December&#xA0;31, 2012.'

S'(1) ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company In March 2007, the Company changed its name from ShieldZone Corporation to ZAGG Incorporated to better position the Company for expansion in the mobile device accessories industry through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The ShieldZone name was very specific to the screen protection product line, and although screen protection is a core product line, the name change has provided the Company with the opportunity to add new product categories to its product portfolio. During 2011, the Company changed its name from ZAGG Incorporated to ZAGG Inc. In June 2011, ZAGG acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of iFrogz, which further diversified the existing ZAGG product lines, particularly for audio and protective case accessories. The Company designs, produces, and distributes professional and premium creative product solutions including screen protection, keyboards for tablet computers and mobile devices, keyboard cases, earbuds, mobile power solutions, cables, and cases under the ZAGG and InvisibleShield brands. In addition, the Company designs, produces, and distributes earbuds, headphones, mobile power solutions, Bluetooth speakers, cases, and cables for mobile devices under the iFrogz brand in the fashion and youth oriented lifestyle sector. Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;US GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates include the inventory write-downs, sales returns and warranty liability, and income taxes. These estimates and assumptions are based on management&#8217;s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate an adjustment is necessary. Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ZAGG Inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries ZAGG International Distribution Limited (&#8220;ZAGG International&#8221;), Patriot Corporation, ZAGG Intellectual Property Holding Co, Inc., and ZAGG Retail, Inc. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company holds an investment in HzO, Inc. (&#8220;HzO&#8221;), a private company engaged in the development of water-blocking technologies for consumer and industrial applications. The investment is less than 20% and thus is accounted for under the cost method. Due to accumulated losses, the carrying amount of the investment in HzO was $0 at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Amounts receivable from credit card processors are also considered cash equivalents because they are both short-term and highly liquid in nature and are typically converted to cash within three days of the sales transaction. Amounts receivable from credit card processors at December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $61 and $120, respectively. Cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, consisted primarily of money market fund investments and amounts receivable from credit card processors.  Fair value measurements The Company measures at fair value certain financial and non-financial assets by using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price, based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: Level 1 &#8212; Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 &#8212; Significant other observable inputs (e.g., quoted prices for similar items in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar items in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as interest rate and yield curves, and market-corroborated inputs); and Level 3 &#8212; Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting unit to develop its own assumptions. Accounts receivable The Company sells its products to end users through indirect distribution channels and other resellers who are extended credit terms after an analysis of their financial condition and credit worthiness. Credit terms to distributors and resellers, when extended, are based on evaluation of the customers&#8217; financial condition. Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. Management regularly evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts considering historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions, customers&#8217; financial condition, receivables in dispute, receivables aging, and current payment patterns. Account balances are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. Payments subsequently received on written off receivables are credited to bad debt expense in the period of recovery. The following summarizes the activity in the Company&#8217;s allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:  Inventories Inventories, consisting primarily of finished goods and raw materials, are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first in, first out basis, or market. Management performs periodic assessments to determine the existence of obsolete, slow moving, and non-saleable inventories, and records necessary write downs in cost of sales to reduce such inventories to net realizable value. Once established, the original cost of the inventory less the related inventory write down represents the new cost basis of such products.  Property and equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Major additions and improvements are capitalized, while costs for minor replacements, maintenance and repairs that do not increase the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts. The resulting gain or loss is reflected in selling, general and administrative expense.During the second quarter of 2014, the Company commenced a development project utilizing both internal and external developers to improve the company&#8217;s website. The development project was intended to provide additional functionality to the website and transition the website to an improved software platform. The Company capitalized website development costs for internal and external developers and commenced depreciation of the capitalized costs during 2015 when the resulting website functionality was ready for its intended use and placed in service.Intangibles assetsIntangible assets include internet addresses, patents, intellectual property, and acquired intangibles in connection with the acquisition of iFrogz, which include customer relationships, trademarks, non-compete agreements, and other miscellaneous intangible assets. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated economic lives, using a straight-line or accelerated method consistent with the underlying expected future cash flows related to the specific intangible asset. Amortization expense is recorded within cost of sales or operating expense depending on the underlying intangible assets.Impairment of long-lived assetsLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Revenue recognition The Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company&#8217;s revenue is derived from sales of our products through our indirect channel, including retailers and distributors; through our direct channel, including www.ZAGG.com, and our corporate-owned and third-party-owned mall kiosks; and from the franchise fees derived from the onboarding of new franchisees. For product sales, our standard shipping terms are FOB shipping point, and we record revenue when the product is shipped, net of estimated returns and discounts. For some customers, the contractual shipping terms are FOB destination. For these shipments, we record revenue when the product is delivered, net of estimated returns and discounts. For franchise fees, we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the franchise term. The Company records revenue from royalty agreements in the period in which the royalty is earned. Promotional products given to customers or potential customers are recognized as a cost of sales. Cash incentives provided to our customers are recognized as a reduction of the related sale price, and, therefore, are a reduction in sales.   Allowance for sales returns, warranty, and other credits For product sales, the Company records revenue, net of estimated returns and discounts, when delivery has occurred, collection of the relevant receivable is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. Our return policy allows end users and certain retailers rights to return purchased products. In addition, the Company generally provides the ultimate consumer a warranty with each product. Due to the nature of the screen protection product line, end user returns for screen protection are generally not salvageable and are not included in inventory. We estimate a reserve for sales returns, warranty, and other credits, and record the estimated reserve amount as a reduction of sales, and as a sales return reserve liability. When product is returned and is expected to be resold, as is the case with returns of packaged screen protection, keyboards, audio products, cases, and power products, the impact is recorded as a reduction of revenues and cost of sales, and as a reduction in the sales return reserve liability. The sales returns and warranty reserve requires management to make estimates regarding return rates for sales and warranty returns. Historical experience, actual claims, and customer return rights are the key factors used in determining the estimated sales return and warranty reserve. The following summarizes the activity in the Company&#8217;s sales return and warranty liability for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:  Income taxes The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets or liabilities for expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income tax assets or liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply when differences are expected to be settled or realized. Deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable in the future. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of income tax provision. The Company has foreign subsidiaries that conduct or support its business outside the United States. The Company does not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings for its foreign subsidiaries as the foreign earnings will be permanently reinvested in such foreign jurisdictions.  Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated financial statements for awards granted to employees and non-employees, which include restricted stock, stock options, and warrants. Equity-classified awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value of restricted stock is measured on the grant date based on the quoted closing market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The fair value of the stock options is measured on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the underlying common stock closing price as of the date of grant, the expected term, stock price volatility, and risk-free interest rates. The Company recognizes compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the award. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis for those performance-based awards that are probable to be achieved. No compensation expense is ultimately recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service and are forfeited. Excess tax benefits of awards that are recognized in equity related to stock option exercises are reflected as financing cash inflows. Advertising and marketing General advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising allowances provided to retailers are recorded as an expense at the time of the related sale if the Company receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration and has evidence of fair value for the advertising; otherwise, the allowance is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $10,436, $7,542 and $8,952, respectively. Foreign currency translation and transactions The Company&#8217;s primary operations are at the parent level which uses the U.S. dollar (USD) as its functional currency. The Euro is the functional currency of the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, assets and liabilities for these subsidiaries are translated into USD using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recorded as a component of stockholders&#8217; equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income as a component of other income and (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and totaled $52, $149 and ($7) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Earnings per share Basic earnings per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other common stock equivalents were exercised or converted into common stock. The dilutive effect of stock options or other common stock equivalents is calculated using the treasury stock method. The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to calculate basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013:  For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, restricted stock, warrants and stock options to purchase 250, 485, and 620 shares of common stock, respectively, were not considered in calculating diluted earnings per share because the warrant or stock option exercise prices or the total expected proceeds under the treasury stock method for the warrants, restricted stock, or stock options was greater than the average market price of common shares during the period and, therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive. Recent accounting pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued an Accounting Standard Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-09, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).&#8221; This ASU includes a five-step process by which entities will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also will require enhanced disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. On July 9, 2015, the FASB voted to approve a one year deferral of the effective date of this ASU. This deferral was issued by the FASB in ASU No. 2015-14, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Deferral of the Effective Date&#8221;. As a result of ASU No. 2015-14 the Company expects that it will apply the new revenue standard to annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, &#8220;Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.&#8221; This ASU provides guidance to entities that measure inventory using a method other than last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. For entities using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost, the measurement principle for their inventory changes from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. Current U.S. GAAP requires, at each financial statement date, that entities measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The measurement of market is commonly the current replacement cost. However, entities also need to consider net realizable value and net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin in their measurement. For entities using a method other than LIFO or the retail inventory method, the ASU replaces market with net realizable value. This ASU requires prospective adoption for inventory measurement for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 for public business entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, &#8220;Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,&#8221; which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. The ASU is effective for public business entities for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, &#8220;Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,&#8221; which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The ASU is effective for public business entities for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.'

S'Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation and Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority and wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.As of December 31, 2012, the Company owned 100% of NetSuite Kabushiki Kaisha (&#8220;NetSuite KK&#8221;), a Japanese corporation. In 2010, the Company purchased the remaining outstanding equity in NetSuite KK for aggregate consideration of $1.4 million. Prior to the Company&#8217;s purchase of the remaining outstanding equity of NetSuite KK, given the Company&#8217;s majority ownership interest, the accounts of NetSuite KK were consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a noncontrolling interest was recorded for the other investors&#8217; interests in the net assets and operations of NetSuite KK to the extent of the noncontrolling investors&#8217; individual investments.Recent Accounting StandardsIn September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update, Testing Goodwill for Impairment (the revised standard). The revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a &#8220;qualitative&#8221; assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.  Early adoption is permitted provided that the entity has not yet performed its 2011 annual impairment test or issued its financial statements.  An entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.  The Company adopted the revised standard in 2012 and the adoption did not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial position.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions.  These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.SegmentsThe Company\'s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about revenue by geographic region.  Accordingly, the Company has determined that it has a single reportable segment, specifically, the provision of cloud-based business management application suites. Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates revenue from two sources: (1) subscription and support; and (2) professional services and other.  Subscription and support revenue includes subscription fees from customers accessing its cloud-based application suite and support fees from customers purchasing support.  Arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud-based application service at any time.  Professional services and other revenue include fees from consultation services to support the business process mapping, configuration, data migration, integration and training.  Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.For the most part, subscription and support agreements are entered into for 12 to 36 months.  In aggregate, more than 90% of the professional services component of the arrangements with customers is performed within 300 days of entering into a contract with the customer.The subscription agreements provide service level commitments of 99.5% uptime per period, excluding scheduled maintenance.  The failure to meet this level of service availability may require the Company to credit qualifying customers up to the value of an entire month of their subscription and support fees.  In light of the Company&#8217;s historical experience with meeting its service level commitments, the Company does not currently have any liabilities on its balance sheet for these commitments.The Company commences revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:    In most instances, revenue from new customer acquisition is generated under sales agreements with multiple elements, comprised of subscription and support fees from customers accessing its cloud-based application suite and professional services associated with consultation services.  The Company evaluates each element in a multiple-element arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting.  An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within the Company&#8217;s control.  Subscription and support have standalone value because they are routinely sold separately by the Company.  Professional services have standalone value because the Company has sold professional services separately and there are several third party vendors that routinely provide similar professional services to its customers on a standalone basis.In October 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards for multiple-element revenue arrangements (&#8220;ASU 2009-13&#8221;) to:  The Company early adopted this accounting guidance on April 1, 2010, for applicable arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2010 (the beginning of the Company&#8217;s fiscal year).Prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company was not able to establish VSOE or TPE for any of the undelivered elements.  As a result, the Company typically recognized subscription and support, and professional services revenue ratably over the contract period, and allocated subscription and support revenue and professional services revenue based on the contract price. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company allocates revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy.  The selling price for a deliverable is based on its VSOE, if available, TPE, if VSOE is not available, or ESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.  As the Company has been unable to establish VSOE or TPE for the elements of its arrangements, the Company establishes the ESP for each element primarily by considering the weighted average of actual sales prices of professional services sold on a standalone basis and subscription and support including various add-on modules when sold together without professional services, and other factors such as gross margin objectives, pricing practices and growth strategy.  The consideration allocated to subscription and support is recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period.  The consideration allocated to professional services is recognized as revenue on a percentage-of-completion method.  The Company has established processes to determine ESP, allocate revenue in multiple arrangements using ESP, and make reasonably dependable estimates of the percentage-of-completion method for professional services.The total arrangement fee for a multiple element arrangement is allocated based on the relative ESP of each element unless the fee allocated to the subscription and support under this method is less than the fee subject to refund if the performance conditions are not met.  In these instances, since the professional services are generally completed prior to completion of the subscription and support, the allocation of the fee for subscription and support is at least equal to the contractual amounts subject to the performance conditions.Prior to adoption of ASU 2009-13, in multiple element arrangements where the Company determined that a subset of professional services was essential to the customers use of the subscription services (&#8220;Essential Professional Services Arrangements&#8221;), the Company deferred the commencement of revenue recognition for the entire arrangement until it had delivered the essential professional services component or made a determination that the remaining professional services were no longer essential to the customer.  With the adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company recognizes revenue for subscription and support services in such an arrangement over the contract period commencing when the subscription service is made available to the customer and for professional services on a percentage-of-completion method.For single element sales agreements, subscription and support revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the provisioning date of the contract.  Prior to April 1, 2010, professional services revenue generated under single element sales agreements was immaterial and therefore was recognized when fully delivered.  As of April 1, 2010, the date of adoption of ASU 2009-13, the Company recognizes professional services revenue based on percentage-of-completion method for both single and multiple element arrangements since the Company can now separate the professional services revenue from subscription and support revenue. Sales and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenues.Deferred RevenueDeferred revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met.  The Company generally invoices its customers annually or in monthly or quarterly installments.  Accordingly, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements.  Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12 month period is recorded as current deferred revenue, and the remaining portion is recorded as non-current deferred revenue.During the second quarter of 2012, the Company updated the terms of its standard renewal agreement form so that the legal obligation to pay by our customers occurs upon execution of the renewal agreement rather than on their renewal date. Based on our existing policy of recording amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and deferred revenue where the customer has a legal obligation to pay, invoices from these renewal agreements are now recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue upon execution of the renewal agreement rather than at the start of the renewal period. Had the Company not revised the terms of these renewal agreements, its would have recorded approximately $10.0 million less in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as of December 31, 2012.Cost of RevenueCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting the Company\'s cloud-based application suite, providing customer support, data communications expenses, salaries and benefits of operations and support personnel, software license fees, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal use software and acquired developed technology assets and property and equipment depreciation.  Costs related to professional services are expensed as incurred.Deferred CommissionsThe Company capitalizes commission costs that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition of customer contracts.  Commission costs are accrued and capitalized upon execution of the sales contract by the customer.  Payments to partners and sales personnel are made shortly after the receipt of the related customer payment.  Deferred commissions are amortized over the term of the related non-cancelable customer contract and are recoverable through the related future revenue streams.  The Company capitalized commission costs of$50.5 million,$44.4 millionand$27.6 millionduring the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011and2010, respectively.  Commission amortization expense was$45.3 million,$34.7 millionand$23.5 millionduring the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011and2010, respectively.Internal Use Software and Website Development CostsThe Company capitalizes certain development costs incurred in connection with its internal use software and website.  These capitalized costs are primarily related to the integrated business management application suite that is hosted by the Company and accessed by its customers on a subscription basis.  Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred.  Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.  Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing.  The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality.  Capitalized costs are recorded as part of property and equipment.  Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred.  Internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years.  Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.  There were no impairments to internal software during the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011and2010.  The Company capitalized$4.1 million,$1.3 millionand$96,000in internal use software during the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011and2010, respectively.  Included in the 2012 and 2011 capitalized development costs are$990,000and$448,000, respectively, in stock-based compensation costs.  Capitalized stock-based compensation costs in 2010 were negligible.  Amortization expense totaled$629,000,$302,000and$221,000during the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011and2010, respectively.  The net book value of capitalized internal use software atDecember 31, 2012and2011was$5.0 millionand$1.3 million, respectively.  In December 2012, the Company purchased$1.5 millionin developed technology which was capitalized as internal use software.  A total of$1.3 millionwas paid to the two former owners on the purchase date and the remaining$225,000is to be paid within15months after the purchase date.  The$1.5 milliontotal purchase price is included in the$4.1 millionin development costs capitalized in 2012.  The Company plans to integrate this developed technology into its data center production environment.  Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability approach.  Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax reporting purposes, net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits measured by applying currently enacted tax laws.  Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.Compliance with income tax regulations requires the Company to make decisions relating to the transfer pricing of revenue and expenses between each of its legal entities that are located in several countries.  The Company\'s determinations include many decisions based on management\'s knowledge of the underlying assets of the business, the legal ownership of these assets, and the ultimate transactions conducted with customers and other third parties.  The calculation of the Company\'s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple tax jurisdictions.  The Company may be periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  These reviews may include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, the Company records estimated reserves when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.  Such estimates are subject to change.  See Note 15 for information regarding the impact of the Company\'s accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are comprised of investments in money market mutual funds.  Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsThe Company records goodwill when consideration paid in a purchase acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and the identified intangible assets acquired.  Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review.  The Company has determined that there is a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment tests.  For purposes of assessing the impairment of goodwill, the Company annually estimates the fair value of the reporting unit and compares this amount to the carrying value of the reporting unit.  If the Company determines that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal2012, the Company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill.  Based upon that evaluation the Company determined that its goodwill was not impaired atDecember 31, 2012.Other intangible assets, consisting of developed technology, trade name and customer relationships, are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.  All other intangible assets have been determined to have definite lives and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated remaining economic lives, ranging from one to seven years.  Amortization expense related to developed technology is included in cost of subscription and support revenue while amortization expense related to tradenames and customer relationships is included in sales and marketing expense.Long-lived AssetsThe Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets may not be recoverable.  When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through their undiscounted expected future cash flow.  If the future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of these assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.Impairment of Intangible AssetIn 2009, the Company acquired QuickArrow (&#8220;QA&#8221;) for approximately$19.4 millionand assigned$3.3 millionto the developed technology intangible asset.  The QA developed technology was being amortized over a four year period to cost of revenue.  In the second quarter of 2012, certain QA customers transitioned from the QA service offering to a NetSuite service offering or terminated their service completely.  As a result, the QA expected undiscounted cash flows decreased below the carrying value of the QA developed technology assets and the Company recorded a$401,000impairment charge.$401,000represented the excess of the carrying amount of the QA developed technology over the fair value of such asset as of June 30, 2012.  The QA developed technology fair value at June 30, 2012 was derived from the expected QA future cash flows which were based on revenue generated by customers using the QA service, a Level 3 unobservable input as described in note 5.  The Company amortized the remaining$481,000net carrying value of the asset over the second half of 2012.The Company did not recognize any impairment charges on its long-lived assets during the years ended2011and2010.LeasesThe Company leases worldwide facilities and certain other equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements.  The terms of certain lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis.  The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period and accrues for rent expense incurred but not paid.Under certain leases, the Company also receives reimbursements for leasehold improvements.  These reimbursements are lease incentives which are recognized as a liability and are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease as a component of minimum rental expense.  The leasehold improvements are included in property, plant and equipment and are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the lease term.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated asset lives.  The estimated useful lives by asset classification are generally as follows:   Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in other income.Warranties and IndemnificationThe Company\'s cloud-based application service is typically warranted to perform in a manner consistent with general industry standards that are reasonably applicable and materially in accordance with the Company\'s on-line help documentation under normal use and circumstances.The Company includes service level commitments to its customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those customers to receive credits in the event that the Company fails to meet those levels.  To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such commitments and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.The Company has also agreed to indemnify its directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding to which any of those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person\'s service as a director or officer, including any action by the Company, arising out of that person\'s services as the Company\'s director or officer or that person\'s services provided to any other company or enterprise at the Company\'s request.  The Company maintains director and officer insurance coverage that may enable the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.The Company\'s arrangements include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe a third-party\'s intellectual property rights.  The Company has not incurred any costs as a result of such indemnifications and has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and SuppliersFinancial instruments potentially exposing the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and trade accounts receivable.  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivables balance.  The allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with problem accounts.  The Company generally charges off uncollectible accounts receivable balances when accounts are 120 days past-due based on the account\'s contractual terms.  Credit risk arising from accounts receivable is mitigated due to the large number of customers comprising the Company\'s customer base and their dispersion across various industries.  AtDecember 31, 2012and2011, there were no customers that represented more than 10% of the net accounts receivable balance.  There were no customers that individually exceeded 10% of the Company\'s revenue in any of the periods presented.  AtDecember 31, 2012and2011, long-lived assets located outside the United States were not significant.  Revenue by geographic region, based on the billing address of the customer, was as follows for the periods presented:No single country outside the United States represented more than10%of revenue during the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011or2010.Certain Significant Risks and UncertaintiesThe Company participates in the dynamic high technology industry and believes that changes in any of the following areas could have a material adverse effect on the Company\'s future financial position, results of operations or cash flows; advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards; pressures resulting from new applications offered by competitors; changes in certain strategic relationships or customer relationships; litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property, patent, product, regulatory or other factors; risk associated with changes in domestic and international economic or political conditions or regulations; availability of necessary product components; and the Company\'s ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support its growth.Foreign Currency TranslationThe U.S. dollar is the reporting currency for all periods presented.  The financial information for entities outside the United States is measured in their functional currency which, depending on circumstances, may either be the local currency or the U.S. dollar.  The Company translates its financial statements of consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars.  The Company translates its assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date and translates statement of operations accounts using the average exchange rate for the period.  Exchange rate differences resulting from translation adjustments are accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  Gains or losses, whether realized or unrealized, due to transactions in foreign currencies are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the line item other income / (expense).  The Company recognized net foreign currency losses of $487,000,$102,000and$371,000during the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011and2010, respectively.Advertising ExpenseAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.  For the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011and2010, advertising expense was$4.1 million,$3.5 millionand$3.2 million, respectively.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company uses the fair value method for recording stock-based compensation for new awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled.  The Company recognizes compensation costs for stock option grants, restricted awards and restricted stock unit awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire awards.  The Company recognizes compensation expense related to performance share awards based on the accelerated method which recognizes a larger portion of the expense during the beginning of the vesting period than in the end of the vesting period.Under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"), the Company has granted selected executives and other key employees performance shares ("PS") and performance share units ("PSUs"), which are restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;).  PS vesting is contingent upon meeting certain company-wide performance goals while PSUs vesting is contingent upon meeting certain company-wide performance goals and market-based performance goals.  Unforfeited PS and PSUs generally will vest in three equal annual tranches over the service period.  However, the 2011 PSU grants vested 1/12 per quarter with the initial vesting event on February 15, 2012.  The PS and PSUs grant date fair value, which is also the total stock-based compensation expense associated with the performance based awards, is determined based on the value of the underlying shares on the grant date and is recognized over the vesting term.  On a quarterly basis, management estimates the number of PS and PSUs that will be granted at the end of the performance period.  The PS fair value is based on market value of shares on the grant date (the intrinsic value).  The fair value of the market-based PSUs on the grant date (measurement date) is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that estimates the distribution of the potential outcomes of the PSU grants based on simulated future stock prices of the peer group.  In 2012, performance metrics for  certain PS awarded for 2013 and 2014 had not been set by the Company\'s Board of Directors.  As such, there is no accounting for these awards until the performances metrics are set.The Company accounts for compensation expense related to stock options granted to consultants and other non-employees based on the fair values estimated using the Black-Scholes model on the date of grant and re-measured at each reporting date over the performance period.  The compensation expense is amortized using the straight-line method over the related service term.The Company issues new shares of its common stock upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock, RSUs, PSs and PSUs.Qualified Operating Expense ReimbursementsAt the Company\'s product development facility in the Czech Republic, the Company participates in a government subsidy program for employing local residents.  Under the program, the Czech Republic government will reimburse the Company for certain operating expenses it incurs.  While the Company became eligible to participate in this program in 2010, it did not record a subsidy credit in the financial statements until it was assured of collection in 2012.  Effective January 2012, when the Company incurs reimbursable operating expenses, it records a reduction in product development expenses and a receivable from the Czech government.  During the year endedDecember 31, 2012, the Company\'s product development operating expenses were reduced by approximately$2.0 millionfor reimbursements of eligible operating expenses incurred during the period from November 2010 to December 31, 2012.  The Company received approximately$1.2 millionin payments from the Czech Republic government during year ended December 31, 2012.  As ofDecember 31, 2012,$846,000in reimbursements, adjusted for foreign currency valuations, are due the Company and included in other current assets. Net Loss Per Common ShareBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to NetSuite Inc. common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period less the weighted-average number of unvested common shares subject to the Company\'s right of repurchase.  Diluted net loss per common share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, including options, common stock subject to repurchase and warrants.  Basic and diluted net loss per common share was the same for all periods presented as the impact of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding was anti-dilutive.Accumulated Other Comprehensive LossAccumulated other comprehensive loss is comprised of foreign currency translation gains and losses, net of tax, and an accumulated pension liability for employees located in the Philippines.  The foreign currency translation gains /(losses), net of taxes as ofDecember 31, 2012and2011and were$(1.2) million,$(499,000), respectively. The accumulated pension liability as ofDecember 31, 2012and2011was of$200,000and$130,000, respectively.'

S'NOTE 1:  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESACCOUNTING PRINCIPLESThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The following is a description of the significant accounting policies of Eastman Kodak Company.BASIS OF CONSOLIDATIONThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastman Kodak Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and its majority owned subsidiaries (collectively &#8220;the Company&#8221;).  The Company consolidates variable interest entities if the Company has a controlling financial interest and is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the entity.  The Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not hold a controlling interest, under the equity method of accounting, and the Company records its proportionate share of income or losses in Other income (charges), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company accounts for investments in companies over which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method of accounting.  These investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value.  The Company has eliminated all significant intercompany accounts and transactions, and net earnings are reduced by the portion of the net earnings of subsidiaries applicable to noncontrolling interests.USE OF ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.FOREIGN CURRENCYFor most subsidiaries and branches outside the U.S., the local currency is the functional currency.  The financial statements of these subsidiaries and branches are translated into U.S. dollars as follows: assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates; income, expenses and cash flows at average exchange rates; and shareholders&#8217; equity at historical exchange rates.  For those subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency, the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  Translation adjustments related to investments that are permanent in nature are not tax-effected.For certain other subsidiaries and branches, operations are conducted primarily in U.S. dollars, which is therefore the functional currency.  Monetary assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries and branches, which are recorded in local currency, are remeasured at year-end exchange rates, while the related revenue, expense, and gain and loss accounts, which are recorded in local currency, are remeasured at average exchange rates.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities, and the related revenue, expense, and gain and loss accounts, are remeasured at historical rates.  Adjustments that result from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are included in Net (loss) earnings in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.The effects of foreign currency transactions, including related hedging activities, are included in Other income (charges), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and derivative instruments.  The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution.  With respect to receivables, such receivables arise from sales to numerous customers in a variety of industries, markets, and geographies around the world.  Receivables arising from these sales are generally not collateralized.  The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers&#8217; financial conditions, and maintains reserves for potential credit losses and such losses, in the aggregate, have not exceeded management&#8217;s expectations.  With respect to the derivative instruments, the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions.  The Company has not experienced non-performance by any of its derivative instruments counterparties.DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSAll derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value.  Certain derivatives are designated and accounted for as hedges.  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes.  See Note 12, &#8220;Financial Instruments.&#8221;CASH EQUIVALENTSAll highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.INVENTORIESInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  The cost of all of the Company&#8217;s inventories is determined by either the &#8220;first in, first out&#8221; (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) or average cost method, which approximates current cost.  The Company provides inventory reserves for excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on changes in customer demand, technology developments or other economic factors.PROPERTIESProperties are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.  The Company capitalizes additions and improvements.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  The Company calculates depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the assets&#8217; estimated useful lives, which are as follows:The Company depreciates leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the asset&#8217;s estimated useful life.  Upon sale or other disposition, the applicable amounts of asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to net (loss) earnings.GOODWILLGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price of an acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired.  Goodwill is not amortized, but is required to be assessed for impairment at least annually.  The Company has elected September 30 as the annual impairment assessment date for all of its reporting units, and will perform additional impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.  A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.  The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units utilizing income and market approaches through the application of discounted cash flow and market comparable methods, respectively.  The assessmentis required to be performed in two steps, step one to test for a potential impairment of goodwill and, if potential losses are identified, step two to measure the impairment loss.  Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.The Company recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $626 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $785 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  See Note 5, &#8220;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#8221;REVENUEThe Company&#8217;s revenue transactions include sales of the following:  products; equipment; software; services; integrated solutions; and intellectual property licensing.  The Company recognizes revenue when realized or realizable and earned, which is when the following criteria are met:  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.  If the Company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of payment.  At the time revenue is recognized, the Company provides for the estimated costs of customer incentive programs, warranties and estimated returns and reduces revenue accordingly.For product sales, the revenue recognition criteria are generally met when title and risk of loss have transferred from the Company to the buyer, which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on contract terms or legal requirements in certain jurisdictions.  Service revenues are recognized as such services are rendered.For equipment sales, the recognition criteria are generally met when the equipment is delivered and installed at the customer site.  Revenue is recognized for equipment upon delivery as opposed to upon installation when there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the installation, and the amount of revenue allocable to the equipment is not legally contingent upon the completion of the installation.  In instances in which the agreement with the customer contains a customer acceptance clause, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained, provided the customer acceptance clause is considered to be substantive.  For certain agreements, the Company does not consider these customer acceptance clauses to be substantive because the Company can and does replicate the customer acceptance test environment and performs the agreed upon product testing prior to shipment.  In these instances, revenue is recognized upon installation of the equipment.Revenue for the sale of software licenses is recognized when: (1) the Company enters into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software; (2) the Company delivers the software; (3) customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties; and (4) collection from the customer is reasonably assured.  Software maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the related maintenance period.Revenue from services includes extended warranty, customer support and maintenance agreements, consulting, business process services, training and education.  Service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed.  In service arrangements where final acceptance of a system or solution by the customer is required, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.The Company\'s transactions may involve the sale of equipment, software, and related services under multiple element arrangements.  The Company allocates revenue to the various elements based on their fair value.  Revenue allocated to an individual element is recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element.The timing and the amount of revenue recognized from the licensing of intellectual property depend upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations.  Revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met: (1) the Company enters into a legally binding arrangement with a licensee of Kodak&#8217;s intellectual property, (2) the Company delivers the technology or intellectual property rights, (3) licensee payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties, and (4) collection from the licensee is reasonably assured.When the Company has continuing obligations related to a licensing arrangement, including extending the rights to currently undeveloped intellectual property, revenue related to the ongoing arrangement is recognized over the period of the obligation.  The Company ascribes revenue on these arrangements over the period of the obligation, beginning when the Company is first entitled to past due royalties (for example, the date the licensee was notified of infringement) through the end of the obligation period.At the time revenue is recognized, the Company also records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs.  Such incentive programs include cash and volume discounts, price protection, promotional, cooperative and other advertising allowances, and coupons.  For those incentives that require the estimation of sales volumes or redemption rates, such as for volume rebates or coupons, the Company uses historical experience and internal and customer data to estimate the sales incentive at the time revenue is recognized.In instances where the Company provides slotting fees or similar arrangements, this incentive is recognized as a reduction in revenue when payment is made to the customer (or at the time the Company has incurred the obligation, if earlier) unless the Company receives a benefit over a period of time, in which case the incentive is recorded as an asset and is amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the arrangement.  Arrangements in which the Company receives an identifiable benefit include arrangements that have enforceable exclusivity provisions and those that provide a clawback provision entitling the Company to a pro rata reimbursement if the customer does not fulfill its obligations under the contract.The Company may offer customer financing to assist customers in their acquisition of Kodak&#8217;s products.  At the time a financing transaction is consummated, which qualifies as a sales-type lease, the Company records equipment revenue equal to the total lease receivable net of unearned income.  Unearned income is recognized as finance income using the effective interest method over the term of the lease.  Leases not qualifying as sales-type leases are accounted for as operating leases.  The Company recognizes revenue from operating leases on an accrual basis as the rental payments become due.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTSResearch and development (&#8220;R&amp;D&#8221;) costs, which include costs incurred in connection with new product development, fundamental and exploratory research, process improvement, product use technology and product accreditation, are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  In connection with business combinations entered into prior to January 1, 2009, the purchase price allocated to R&amp;D projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and for which no alternative future use existed was expensed in the period of acquisition.  Effective January 1, 2009, the acquisition-date fair value of research and development assets acquired in a business combination are capitalized.ADVERTISINGAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations.  Advertising expenses amounted to $301 million, $271 million, and $350 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTSAmounts charged to customers and costs incurred by the Company related to shipping and handling are included in net sales and cost of sales, respectively.IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETSThe Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets, other than goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.  The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying values of long-lived assets by first grouping its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (the asset group) and, secondly, by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group.  The Company estimates the undiscounted cash flows over theremaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group.  If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.  The Company determines fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or, if quoted market prices are unavailable, through the performance of internal analyses of discounted cash flows.In connection with its assessment of recoverability of its long-lived assets and its ongoing strategic review of the business and its operations, the Company continually reviews the remaining useful lives of its long-lived assets.  If this review indicates that the remaining useful life of the long-lived asset has changed significantly, the Company adjusts the depreciation on that asset to facilitate full cost recovery over its revised estimated remaining useful life.INCOME TAXESThe Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of operating losses, credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities.  The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  For discussion of the amounts and components of the valuation allowances as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, see Note 15, &#8220;Income Taxes.&#8221;EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share computations are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.  As a result of the net loss from continuing operations presented for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company calculated diluted earnings per share using weighted-average basic shares outstanding for each period, as utilizing diluted shares would be anti-dilutive to loss per share.  Weighted-average basic shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were 268.5 million, 268.0 million, and 281.8 million shares, respectively.If the Company had reported earnings from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, the following potential shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock would have been dilutive in the computation of diluted earnings per share:The computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 also excluded the assumed conversion of outstanding employee stock options and detachable warrants to purchase common shares, because  the effects would be anti-dilutive.  The following table sets forth the total amount of outstanding employee stock options and detachable warrants to purchase common shares as of December 31 for each reporting period:Diluted earnings per share calculations could also reflect shares related to the assumed conversion of approximately $305 million of convertible senior notes due 2017, if dilutive.  The Company&#8217;s diluted (loss) earnings per share excludes the effect of these convertible securities, as they were anti-dilutive for all periods presented.  Refer to Note 8, &#8220;Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt.&#8221; RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-06, &#8220;Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements,&#8221; which amends the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, &#8220;Fair Value Measures and Disclosures.&#8221;  ASU No. 2010-06 amended the ASC to require disclosure of transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and also will require more detailed disclosure about the activity within Level 3 fair value measurements.  The Company adopted the guidance in ASU No. 2010-06 on January 1, 2010, except for the requirements related to Level 3 disclosures, which will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010 (January 1, 2011 for the Company).   This guidance requires new disclosures only. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance establishing two levels of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)   authoritative and nonauthoritative   and making the ASC the source of authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP, except for rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This guidance, which was incorporated into ASC Topic 105, &#8220;Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,&#8221; was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009.  The adoption changed certain disclosure references to U.S. GAAP, but did not have any other impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements.In June 2009, the FASB issued revised authoritative guidance related to variable interest entities, which requires entities to perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity.  The guidance also requires an ongoing reassessment of variable interests and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining whether an entity is the primary beneficiary.  This guidance, which was reissued by the FASB in December 2009 as ASU No. 2009-17, &#8220;Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities,&#8221; amends ASC Topic 810, &#8220;Consolidation,&#8221; and will be effective as of the beginning of an entity&#8217;s first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009 (January 1, 2010 for the Company).  The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28, &#8220;When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill ImpairmentTest for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts&#8221;, which amends ASC Topic 350, &#8220;Intangibles   Goodwill and Other&#8221;.  ASU No. 2010-28 amends the ASC to require entities that have a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying value to assess whether qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment of goodwill exists, and if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the entity must measure the goodwill impairment. The changes to the ASC as a result of this update are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010 (January 1, 2011 for the Company), and any impairment identified at the time of adoption will be recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings.  The adoption of this guidance does not have any impact on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements.In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements," which amends ASC Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition."  ASU No. 2009-13 amends the ASC to eliminate the residual method of allocation for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method.  The ASU also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which includes: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence if available, (2) third-party evidence if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, and (3) estimated selling price if neither vendor-specific nor third-party evidence is available.  Additionally, ASU No. 2009-13 expands the disclosure requirements related to a vendor\'s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.  The changes to the ASC as a result of this update are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 (January 1, 2011 for the Company).  The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, "Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements," which amends ASC Topic 985, "Software."  ASU No. 2009-14 amends the ASC to change the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements, such that tangible products containing both software and non-software components thatfunction together to deliver the tangible product\'s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of software revenue guidance.  The changes to the ASC as a result of this update are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 (January 1, 2011 for the Company).  The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.'

S'Principles of Consolidation Standard Motor Products, Inc. (referred to hereinafter in these notes to the consolidated financial statements as "we," "us," "our" or the "Company") is engaged in the manufacture and distribution of replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry with an increasing focus on the original equipment service market. The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and all domestic and international companies in which we have more than a 50% equity ownership. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for on the equity method, as we do not have a controlling financial interest.  All significant inter-company items have been eliminated. Use of Estimates In conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial statements. Some of the more significant estimates include allowances for doubtful accounts, cash discounts, valuation of inventory, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, product liability exposures, pensions and other postretirement benefits, asbestos, environmental and litigation matters, valuation of deferred tax assets, share based compensation and sales returns and other allowances.  We can give no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates.  Although we do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimate or in the assumptions that we use in calculating the estimate, unforeseen changes in the industry, or business could materially impact the estimate and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Reclassification Certain prior period amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Cash Discounts We do not generally require collateral for our trade accounts receivable.  Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future.  These allowances are established based on a combination of write-off history, aging analysis, and specific account evaluations.   When a receivable balance is known to be uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.  Cash discounts are provided based on an overall average experience rate applied to qualifying accounts receivable balances. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined by means of the first-in, first-out method) or market.  Where appropriate, standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost; the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs. Estimates of lower of cost or market are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon current economic conditions, historical sales quantities and patterns and, in some cases, the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories. We also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand. For inventory deemed to be obsolete, we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory.  Inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand.  Future projected demand requires management judgment and is based upon (a) our review of historical trends and (b) our estimate of projected customer specific buying patterns and trends in the industry and markets in which we do business.  Using rolling twelve month historical information, we estimate future demand on a continuous basis.  As such, the historical volatility of such estimates has been minimal.  We provided for an inventory reserve of $41.9 million and $39.5 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We use cores (used parts) in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors. The production of air conditioning compressors involves the rebuilding of used cores, which we acquire either in outright purchases from used parts brokers, or from returns pursuant to an exchange program with customers.  Under such exchange programs, we reduce our inventory, through a charge to cost of sales, when we sell a finished good compressor, and put back to inventory the used core exchanged at standard cost through a credit to cost of sales when it is actually received from the customer. Property, Plant and Equipment These assets are recorded at historical cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives as follows:  Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease.  Costs related to maintenance and repairs which do not prolong the assets useful lives are expensed as incurred.  We assess our property, plant and equipment to be held and used for impairment when indicators are present that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill At acquisition, we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which primarily consists of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, patents and non-compete agreements.  The fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on our assessment.  Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations.  Goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives are not amortized to earnings, but instead are subject to periodic testing for impairment.  Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives. We assess the impairment of long-lived and identifiable intangibles assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  With respect to goodwill, we test for impairment of goodwill of a reporting unit on an annual basis or in interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.  Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment review, include the following: (a) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (b) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and (c) significant negative industry or economic trends. We review the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach.  When performing our evaluation, if we conclude qualitatively that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, than the two-step impairment test is not required.  If we are unable to reach this conclusion, then we would perform the two-step impairment test.  Initially, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount.  To the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit; we are required to perform a second step, as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired.  In this step, we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Intangible and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance, plant closures, product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  In addition, identifiable intangible assets having indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.  In reviewing for impairment, we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. When the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the assets fair value and their carrying value. There are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows requiring our judgment in applying these assumptions and estimates to the analysis of identifiable intangibles and long-lived asset impairment including projecting revenues, interest rates, tax rates and the cost of capital.  Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside our control and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods.  These changes can result in future impairments.  In the event our planning assumptions were modified resulting in impairment to our assets, we would be required to include an expense in our statement of operations, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. New Customer Acquisition Costs New customer acquisition costs refer to arrangements pursuant to which we incur change-over costs to induce a new customer to switch from a competitor\'s brand. In addition, change-over costs include the costs related to removing the new customer\'s inventory and replacing it with our inventory commonly referred to as a stocklift. New customer acquisition costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue when incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates.  Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year.  The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying foreign operation is liquidated or substantially disposed of.  Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations under the caption "other non-operating income, net." Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles from both our Engine Management and Temperature Control Segments.  We recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For some of our sales of remanufactured products, we also charge our customers a deposit for the return of a used core component which we can use in our future remanufacturing activities.  Such deposit is not recognized as revenue but rather carried as a core liability. The liability is extinguished when a core is actually returned to us. We estimate and record provisions for cash discounts, quantity rebates, sales returns and warranties in the period the sale is recorded, based upon our prior experience and current trends.  Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating sales returns and allowances relating to revenue recognized in any accounting period. Selling, General and Administration Expenses Selling, general and administration expenses includes shipping costs and advertising, which are expensed as incurred. Shipping and handling charges, as well as freight to customers, are included in distribution expenses as part of selling, general and administration expenses. Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs represent costs incurred in conjunction with our debt financing activities and are capitalized in other assets and amortized over the life of the related financing arrangements.  If the debt is retired early, the related unamortized deferred financing costs are written off in the period the debt is retired and are recorded in the statement of operations under the caption other non-operating income, net. Retirement and Post-Retirement Medical Benefits The determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated expenses requires the use of actuarial valuations to estimate participant plan benefits employees earn while working as well as the present value of those benefits.  Inherent in these valuations are financial assumptions including discount rates at which liabilities can be settled, rates of increase of health care costs as well as employee demographic assumptions such as retirement patterns, mortality and turnover.  Management reviews these assumptions annually with its actuarial advisors.  The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower turnover rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants.  Benefits are determined primarily based upon employees\' length of service.  We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension and postretirement plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders\' equity. Share-Based Compensation We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date.  The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations.  Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical trends in order to estimate the amount of share-based awards that will ultimately vest.  We monitor actual forfeitures for any subsequent adjustment to forfeiture rates. Accounting for Income Taxes Income taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by the current enacted tax rates. We maintain valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred asset will not be realized.  The valuation allowance is intended in part to provide for the uncertainty regarding the ultimate utilization of our U.S. capital loss carryforwards, U.S. foreign tax credit carryovers, and foreign net operating loss carry forwards.  In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we consider all positive and negative evidence and all sources of taxable income such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the deferred tax asset.  The assessment of the adequacy of our valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable.  In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or we adjust these estimates in future periods for current trends or expected changes in our estimating assumptions, we may need to modify the level of valuation allowance which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In December 2011, we realized a non-recurring non-cash benefit of $21.5 million in our tax provision related to a reduction of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance on net U.S. deferred tax assets.  In assessing the ability to recognize our deferred tax assets, we reviewed all positive and negative evidence and considered historical book and taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and projected future book and taxable income.  Based upon this detailed assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our net U.S. deferred tax assets, for which a valuation allowance had been previously recorded, will be realized and, as such, reversed $21.5 million of the valuation allowance on net U.S. deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance of $7.2 million as of December 31, 2012 is intended to provide for uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of our state tax credit carryovers, U.S. capital loss carryforwards, U.S. foreign tax credit carryovers, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards.  Based on these considerations, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset of $44.3 million as of December 31, 2012, which is net of the remaining valuation allowance. Tax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when, in management\'s judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.  For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority.  The liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances and when new information becomes available.  Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management.  While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate. Interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as income tax expense. Net Earnings per Common Share We present two calculations of earnings per common share. "Basic" earnings per common share equals net income divided by weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. "Diluted" earnings per common share equals net income divided by the sum of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares that are anti-dilutive are excluded from net earnings per common share. The following is a reconciliation of the shares used in calculating basic and dilutive net earnings per common share.  The average shares listed below were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented or because they were excluded under the treasury method.  Environmental Reserves We are subject to various U.S. Federal and state and local environmental laws and regulations and are involved in certain environmental remediation efforts. We estimate and accrue our liabilities resulting from such matters based upon a variety of factors including the assessments of environmental engineers and consultants who provide estimates of potential liabilities and remediation costs. Such estimates are not discounted to reflect the time value of money due to the uncertainty in estimating the timing of the expenditures, which may extend over several years.  Potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties of environmental remediation liabilities are recognized independently from the recorded liability, and any asset related to the recovery will be recognized only when the realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. Asbestos Litigation In evaluating our potential asbestos-related liability, we use an actuarial study that is prepared by a leading actuarial firm with expertise in assessing asbestos-related liabilities.  We evaluate the estimate of the range of undiscounted liability to determine which amount to accrue.  If there is no amount within the range of settlement payments that is more likely than any other, we record the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments.  Legal costs are expensed as incurred. Loss Contingencies When it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we establish a reserve based on management\'s judgment as to the likelihood of a range of amounts needed to pay damages in the future for events that have already occurred.  We maintain an ongoing monitoring and identification process to assess how the activities are progressing against the accrued estimated costs.  Adjustments to the liabilities are recorded in the statement of operations in the period when additional information becomes available that affects our estimate of costs or payments to be made. Product Warranty We establish a provision for estimated expenses related to product warranties at the time products are sold.  These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims.  Revision to the reserves for estimated product warranties is made when necessary, based upon changes in these factors.  We regularly study trends of such claims. Trade Receivables In compliance with accounting standards, sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale and any related expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments and accounts receivable. We place our cash investments with high quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution. Although we are directly affected by developments in the vehicle parts industry, management does not believe significant credit risk exists. With respect to accounts receivable, such receivables are primarily from warehouse distributors and major retailers in the automotive aftermarket industry located in the U.S. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\' financial conditions.  Our five largest individual customers, including members of a marketing group, accounted for approximately 64% of our consolidated net sales in 2012, 62% of our consolidated net sales in 2011, and 60% of our consolidated net sales in 2010.  During 2012, O\'Reilly Automotive, Inc., NAPA Auto Parts, and Advance Auto Parts, Inc. accounted for 19%, 18% and 15% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. Net sales from each of the customers were reported in both our Engine Management and Temperature Control segments.  The loss of one or more of these customers or, a significant reduction in purchases of our products from any one of them, could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Substantially all of the cash and cash equivalents, including foreign cash balances, at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were uninsured.  Foreign cash balances at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were $12.9 million and $8.6 million, respectively. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Presentation of Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-05,Presentation of Comprehensive Income("ASU 2011-05"), which amended the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 220,Comprehensive Income.  The amendment eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders\' equity.  In accordance with the amendment an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements.  Additionally, reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income will be presented on the face of the financial statements.  The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, which for us was January 1, 2012 with full retrospective application required.  As a result of the adoption of this standard, we have eliminated the presentation of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders\' equity and have instead presented other comprehensive income in a new statement, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, which immediately follows our consolidated statements of operations. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12,Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU 2011-05("ASU 2011-12"), which indefinitely defers the requirement in FASB ASU 2011-05 to present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements. During the deferral period, entities will still need to comply with the existing requirements for the presentation of reclassification adjustments. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011, which for us was January 1, 2012 with full retrospective application required.  The adoption of this standard did not impact the manner in which we present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02,Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income("ASU 2013-02"), which amends the provisions of FASB ASC 220,Comprehensive Income.  The amendments in this update supercede and replace the presentation requirements for reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in FASB ASU 2011-05 and ASU 2011-12.  The amendment requires an entity to present information about significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component either (1) on the face of the statement where net income is presented or (2) as a separate disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.  The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, which for us is January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.  We do not anticipate that the adoption of FASB ASU 2013-02 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Goodwill Impairment Testing In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08,Testing Goodwill for Impairment("ASU 2011-08"), that amended the provisions of FASB ASC 350,Intangibles   Goodwill and Other("ASC 350").  FASB ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit\'s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test.  If an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it would not be required to perform the two-step impairment test for that reporting unit.  The new standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, which for us was January 1, 2012.  We considered this new standard when conducting our annual impairment test of goodwill. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02,Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment("ASU 2012-02"), which amended the provisions of FASB ASC 350.  FASB ASU 2012-02 permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step impairment test.  If an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, it would not be required to perform the two-step impairment test for that indefinite-lived intangible asset.  The new standard is effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, which for us is January 1, 2013.  Early adoption is permitted.  We will consider this new standard when conducting our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Balance Sheet Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11,Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities("ASU 2011-11").  The update requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.  The amendment will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods.  We do not anticipate that the adoption of FASB ASU 2011-11 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.'

S"Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standard Updates which are not effective until after June 30, 2014 are not expected to have a significant effect on the Company&#8217;s unaudited consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company implemented the following at June 30, 2014: In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, which amended Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 915 Development Stage Entities. The amendment eliminates certain financial reporting requirements surrounding development stage entities, including an amendment to the variable interest entities guidance in ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendment removes the definition of a development stage entity from the ASC, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other entities from U.S. GAAP. Consequently, the amendment eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early application of each of the amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity's financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company has made the election to early adopt this amendment effective June 30, 2014 and, as a result, the Company is no longer presenting or disclosing the information previously required under Topic 915. The early adoption was made to reduce data maintenance by removing all incremental financial reporting requirements for development stage entities. The adoption of this amendment alters the disclosure requirements of the Company, but it does not have any material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations for the current or any prior reporting periods."

S'Note 2 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a)                                Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hill International, Inc. and its majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. (b)                                Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates affecting the consolidated financial statements that are particularly significant include revenue recognition, allocation of purchase price to acquired intangibles and goodwill, recoverability of long-lived assets, income taxes, allowance for doubtful accounts and commitments and contingencies. (c)                                 Foreign Currency Translations and Transactions Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year.  Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity&#8217;s local currency) are included in net (loss) earnings. (d)                                Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of financial instruments, which primarily consists of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and due to bank, approximates carrying value due to the short-term nature of the instruments.  The carrying value of our various credit facilities approximates fair value as the interest rate is variable. The term loan approximates fair value as the Company recently entered into that agreement. (e)                                 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and investments in money market funds and investment grade securities held with high quality financial institutions. The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. (f)                                   Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents advance payments from clients and cash collateral required to be maintained in foreign bank accounts to serve as collateral for letters of credit, bonds or guarantees on several projects.  The cash will remain restricted until the respective project has been completed, which typically is greater than one year. (g)                                Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash investments and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash accounts with high quality financial institutions. Although the Company currently believes that the financial institutions, with which it does business, will be able to fulfill their commitments to it, there is no assurance that those institutions will be able to continue to do so. The Company provides professional services, under contractual arrangements, to domestic and foreign governmental units, institutions and the private sector.  To reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and does not require collateral beyond customary retainers. At December 31, 2012, the accounts receivable related to the work performed prior to March 2011 under contracts in Libya, amounted to approximately $60,000,000. The Company believes that the amounts due will be collected, however, if future events preclude us from doing so, there could be a significant adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position. The following tables show the number of the Company&#8217;s clients which contributed 10% or more of revenue and accounts receivable, respectively:   The following provides information with respect to total revenue from contracts with U.S. federal government agencies:  (h)                                Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate prepared by management based on identification of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the receivable portfolios.  When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company specifically analyzes trade receivables, including retainage receivable, historical bad debts, client credits, client concentrations, client credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in client payment terms.  If the financial condition of clients were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.  Likewise, should the Company determine that it would be able to realize more of its receivables in the future than previously estimated, an adjustment to the allowance would increase earnings in the period such determination was made.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are recorded as deemed necessary. (i)                                   Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:  The Company capitalizes costs associated with internally developed and/or purchased software systems that have reached the application development stage and meet recoverability tests.  Capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal-use software, payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the internal-use software project.  Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. Costs for general and administrative, overhead, maintenance and training, as well as the cost of software that does not add functionality to existing systems, are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of these assets, the cost and related depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in results of operations.  Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and renewals of minor items are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. (j)                                   Retainage Receivable Retainage receivable represents balances billed but not paid by clients pursuant to retainage provisions in the construction management contracts and will be due upon completion of specific tasks or the completion of the contract.  The current portion of retainage receivable is included in accounts receivable and the long-term portion of retainage receivable is included in retainage receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. (k)                                Long-Lived Assets Acquired intangible assets consist of contract rights, client related intangibles and trade names arising from the Company&#8217;s acquisitions.  Contract rights represent the fair value of contracts in progress and backlog of an acquired entity. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination, the estimated fair values of the assets are used to establish the cost bases. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach are used to measure fair value. These assets are amortized over their estimated lives which range from three to fifteen years. The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held-and-used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a long-lived asset is less than its carrying amount, the asset is considered to be impaired. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flow discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. (l)                                   Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and other related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination, the estimated fair values of the assets are used to establish the cost bases. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach are used to measure fair value. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment in its fiscal third quarter. The Company has determined that it has two reporting units, the Project Management unit and the Construction Claims unit. The Company made that determination based on the similarity of the services provided, the methodologies in delivering our services and the similarity of the client base in each of these units. Goodwill is assessed for impairment using a two-step approach. In the first step of the impairment test, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. To the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill may be impaired and the Company must perform a second more detailed assessment. The second step, if necessary, involves allocating the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill as of the assessment date.  The implied fair value of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the businesses, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of the Company&#8217;s weighted average cost of capital. The Company performed its annual impairment test effective July 1, 2012 and noted no impairment for either of its reporting units. In the future, the Company will continue to perform the annual test during its fiscal third quarter unless events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred before that time. Changes in the Company&#8217;s estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. (m)                             Investments Gerens Hill International, S.A. The Company&#8217;s subsidiary, Gerens Hill International, S.A. (&#8220;Gerens Hill&#8221;), has the following cost-basis investments: &#183;                 Concessia, Cartera y Gestion de Infrastructuras, S.A. &#8212; Gerens Hill has made payments totaling $4,239,000 towards a 5.16% interest in this entity which invests in the equity of companies which finance, construct and operate various public and private infrastructure projects. The payments represent 66% of Gerens Hill&#8217;s total required capital contribution. Gerens Hill has accrued the remaining commitment of approximately $2,120,000 and has included that amount in the cost of the investment and in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. &#183;                 Nuevo Hospital de Burgos, S.A. &#8212; Gerens Hill paid $3,761,000 for a 5.18% interest in this entity which, on completion of construction, will operate a new hospital in Burgos, Spain.  On January 12, 2012 Gerens signed an agreement to sell its entire holding to its affiliate Concessia which is subject to the approval of the local authority, the owner of the facility and the financial institutions involved in the project. Gerens Hill received a down payment of $3,149,000 and has accrued a receivable for $612,000. Although the final price is subject to certain conditions, the Company expects the investment to be fully recovered. Other The Company will, in the ordinary course, form joint ventures for specific projects. These joint ventures typically require limited or no investment and simply provide a pass-through for the Company&#8217;s billings.  Any distributions in excess of the Company&#8217;s billings are accounted for as income when received. (n)                               Due to Bank Under the Company&#8217;s cash-management system, certain cash accounts reflect credit balances to the extent checks were disbursed but not immediately funded at the bank. The Company manages this process daily and ensures all checks are funded when presented. (o)                                Deferred Revenue In certain instances the Company may collect advance payments from clients for future services.  Upon receipt, the payments are reflected as deferred revenue in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets. As the services are performed, the Company reduces the balance and recognizes revenue. (p)                                Deferred Rent Rent expenses for operating leases which include scheduled rent increases is determined by expensing the total amount of rent due over the life of the operating lease on a straight-line basis.  The difference between the rent paid under the terms of the lease and the rent expensed on a straight-line basis is recorded as a liability.  The deferred rent at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $2,791,745 and $2,536,000, respectively, and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. (q)                                Income Taxes The Company estimates income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.  This process involves estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.  These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets.  The Company assesses the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes recovery is not likely, the Company establishes a valuation allowance.  To the extent the Company establishes a valuation allowance in a period, it must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of earnings.  The Company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely to be realized in future years.  If the Company determines in the future that it is more likely that the deferred tax assets subject to the valuation allowance will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be adjusted. The Company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management&#8217;s assessment is that the position is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term &#8220;tax position&#8221; refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. (r)                                  Revenue Recognition The Company generates revenue primarily from providing professional services to its clients. Revenue is generally recognized upon the performance of services.  In providing these services, the Company may incur reimbursable expenses, which consist principally of amounts paid to subcontractors and other third parties and travel and other job related expenses that are contractually reimbursable from clients. The Company has determined that it will include reimbursable expenses in computing and reporting its total revenue as long as the Company remains responsible to the client for the fulfillment of the contract and for the overall acceptability of all services provided. The Company earns its revenue from time-and-materials, cost-plus and fixed-price contracts. If estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss, the Company charges the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss becomes known. The cumulative effect of revisions to revenue, estimated costs to complete contracts, including penalties, incentive awards, change orders, claims, anticipated losses, and others are recorded in the accounting period in which the events indicating a loss are known and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur at any time and the effects may be material. Time-and-Materials Contracts Under its time-and-materials contracts, the Company negotiates hourly billing rates and charges its clients based on the actual time that the Company spends on a project. In addition, clients reimburse the Company for its actual out-of-pocket costs of materials and other direct incidental expenditures that the Company incurs in connection with its performance under the contract. Its profit margins on time-and-materials contracts fluctuate based on actual labor and overhead costs that the Company directly charges or allocates to contracts compared with negotiated billing rates. Revenue on these contracts are recognized based on the actual number of hours the Company spends on the projects plus any actual out-of-pocket costs of materials and other direct incidental expenditures that the Company incurs on the projects. Its time-and-materials contracts generally include annual billing rate adjustment provisions. Cost-Plus Contracts The Company has two major types of cost-plus contracts: Cost-Plus Fixed Fee Under cost-plus fixed fee contracts, the Company charges its clients for its costs, including both direct and indirect costs, plus a fixed negotiated fee. In negotiating a cost-plus fixed fee contract, the Company estimates all recoverable direct and indirect costs and then adds a fixed profit component. The total estimated cost plus the negotiated fee represents the total contract value. The Company recognizes revenue based on the actual labor costs, based on hours of labor effort, plus non-labor costs the Company incurs, plus the portion of the fixed fee the Company has earned to date. The Company invoices for its services as revenue is recognized or in accordance with agreed-upon billing schedules. Aggregate revenue from cost-plus fixed fee contracts may vary based on the actual number of labor hours worked and other actual contract costs incurred. However, if actual labor hours and other contract costs exceed the original estimate agreed to by its client, the Company generally must obtain a change order, contract modification, or successfully prevail in a claim in order to receive additional revenue relating to the additional costs (see &#8220;Change Orders and Claims&#8221;). Cost-Plus Fixed Rate Under its cost-plus fixed rate contracts, the Company charges clients for its costs plus negotiated rates based on its indirect costs. In negotiating a cost-plus fixed rate contract, the Company estimates all recoverable direct and indirect costs and then adds a profit component, which is a percentage of total recoverable costs to arrive at a total dollar estimate for the project. The Company recognizes revenue based on the actual total number of labor hours and other costs the Company expends at the cost plus the fixed rate the Company negotiated. Similar to cost-plus fixed fee contracts, aggregate revenue from cost-plus fixed rate contracts may vary and the Company generally must obtain a change order, contract modification, or successfully prevail in a claim in order to receive additional revenue relating to any additional costs that exceed the original contract estimate (see &#8220;Change Orders and Claims&#8221;). Labor costs and subcontractor services are the principal components of its direct costs on cost-plus contracts, although some include materials and other direct costs. Some of these contracts include a provision that the total actual costs plus the fee will not exceed a guaranteed price negotiated with the client. Others include rate ceilings that limit the reimbursement for general and administrative costs, overhead costs and materials handling costs. The accounting for these contracts appropriately reflects such guaranteed price or rate ceilings. Firm Fixed-Price (&#8220;FFP&#8221;) Contracts The Company&#8217;s FFP contracts have historically accounted for most of its fixed-price contracts. Under FFP contracts, the Company&#8217;s clients pay an agreed amount negotiated in advance for a specified scope of work. The Company recognizes revenue on FFP contracts using the percentage-of-completion method (recognizing revenue as costs are incurred). Profit margins the Company recognizes in all periods prior to completion of the project on any FFP contract depend on the accuracy of the Company&#8217;s estimates of approximate revenue and expenses and will increase to the extent that its current estimates of aggregate actual costs are below amounts previously estimated. Conversely, if the Company&#8217;s current estimated costs exceed prior estimates, its profit margins will decrease and the Company may realize a loss on a project. In order to increase aggregate revenue on the contract, the Company generally must obtain a change order, contract modification, or successfully prevail in a claim in order to receive payment for the additional costs (see &#8220;Change Orders and Claims&#8221;). Change Orders and Claims Change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the provisions of the contract without adding new provisions. Either the Company or its client may initiate change orders. They may include changes in specifications or design, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work. Claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price that the Company seeks to collect from its clients or others for client-caused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes of unanticipated additional contract costs. Change orders and claims occur when changes are experienced once contract performance is underway. Change orders are sometimes documented and terms of such change orders are agreed with the client before the work is performed. Sometimes circumstances require that work progresses before agreement is reached with the client. Costs related to change orders and claims are recognized when they are incurred. Change orders and claims are included in total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that the change order or claim will result in a bona fide addition to contract value that can be reliably estimated. No profit is recognized on claims until final settlement occurs; unapproved change orders are evaluated as claims. This can lead to a situation where costs are recognized in one period and revenue is recognized when client agreement is obtained or claims resolution occurs, which can be in subsequent periods. The Company has contracts with the U.S. government that contain provisions requiring compliance with the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations (&#8220;FAR&#8221;). These regulations are generally applicable to all of its federal government contracts and are partially or fully incorporated in many local and state agency contracts. They limit the recovery of certain specified indirect costs on contracts subject to the FAR. Cost-plus contracts covered by the FAR provide for upward or downward adjustments if actual recoverable costs differ from the estimate billed under forward pricing arrangements. Most of its federal government contracts are subject to termination at the convenience of the client. Contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination. Federal government contracts which are subject to the FAR and some state and local governmental agencies require audits, which are performed for the most part by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (&#8220;DCAA&#8221;). The DCAA audits the Company&#8217;s overhead rates, cost proposals, incurred government contract costs, and internal control systems. During the course of its audits, the DCAA may question incurred costs if it believes the Company has accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of the FAR or Cost Accounting Standards and recommend that its U.S. government corporate administrative contracting officer disallow such costs. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant disallowed costs as a result of such audits. However, the Company can provide no assurance that the DCAA audits will not result in material disallowances of incurred costs in the future. (s)                                  Share-Based Compensation The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the estimated fair value of options to purchase the Company&#8217;s common stock. The compensation expense, less estimated forfeitures, is being recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. The Company&#8217;s policy is to use newly issued shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options. (t)                                   Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to the following (in thousands):  (u)                                Earnings per Share Basic earnings per common share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. Dilutive stock options increased average common shares outstanding by approximately 566,000 shares for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, stock options were anti-dilutive. Options to purchase 4,492,000 shares, 2,385,000 shares and 1,325,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were not included in the calculation of common shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, because they were anti-dilutive. (v)                                 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2011-5, which amends the Comprehensive Income Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;). The ASU eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders&#8217; equity, and instead requires consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income either in a continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2012. The adoption had no effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-4, which amends the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the ASC to help achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU No. 2011-4 does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2012. The ASU had no effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-2, which amends the Comprehensive Income Topic of the ASC.The ASU requires companies to report either on the income statement or disclose in the footnotes to the financial statement the effects on earnings from items that are reclassified out of the category of shareholder equity called accumulated other comprehensive income. The adjustments will consist of amounts from the fiscal period covered by the financial statements. Companies will also have to make cross references to other disclosures required in U.S. GAAP for other line items used to adjust earnings. The FASB wants this requirement applied to amounts that are initially transferred to another balance sheet item before being entered as an adjustment to earnings. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods commencing after December 15, 2012. The Company will adopt the ASU as required. The ASU will not affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.'

S'1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesxbrl,bodyAlseres Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the &#x201C;Company&#x201D;) is a biotechnology company engaged in the development of diagnostic products primarily for disorders in the central nervous system. The Company was founded in 1992 and merged with a publicly held company in 1995 (the &#x201C;Merger&#x201D;) whereby the Company changed its name to Boston Life Sciences, Inc. Effective June&#xA0;7, 2007, the Company changed its name to Alseres Pharmaceuticals, Inc. During the period from inception through December&#xA0;31, 2013, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, raising financing, furthering the research and development of its technologies, and corporate partnering efforts. Accordingly, the Company is considered to be a &#x201C;development stage enterprise&#x201D; as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)&#xA0;915,Development Stage Entitiesand will continue to be so until the commencement of commercial operations. The development stage is from October&#xA0;16, 1992 (inception)&#xA0;through December&#xA0;31, 2013.The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The uncertainty inherent in the need to raise additional capital and the Company&#x2019;s recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about the Company&#x2019;s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.Basis of PresentationThe Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of its seven subsidiaries where all of the Company&#x2019;s operations are conducted. During 2012 the Company organized its seventh subsidiary, Alseres Neurodiagnostics, Inc. as a Delaware corporation. As of December&#xA0;31, 2013 all of the subsidiaries were wholly-owned. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid financial instruments that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. As of December&#xA0;31, 2013 and 2012, cash equivalents consisted of money market funds.Short-term InvestmentsThe Company has designated its marketable securities as of each balance sheet date as available-for-sale securities and accounts for them at their respective fair values. Marketable securities are classified as short-term or long-term investments based on the nature of these securities and the availability of these securities to meet current operating requirements. Marketable securities that are readily available for use in current operations are classified as short-term available-for-sale securities and are reported as a component of current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company reviews all available-for-sale securities at each period end to determine if they remain available-for-sale based on the Company&#x2019;s then current intent and ability to sell the security if it is required to do so. As of December&#xA0;31, 2013, the Company&#x2019;s short-term investments included 95,000 shares of common stock in Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (Navidea or NAVB). The unrealized gain associated with these marketable securities has been determined to be temporary and therefore has been included in other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders&#x2019; deficit.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying amounts of the Company&#x2019;s cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, trade payables and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Short-term investments consist of available-for-sale-securities as of December&#xA0;31, 2013 and 2012 and are carried at fair value as disclosed in Note 11. The fair value of the Company&#x2019;s long-term debt and promissory note is estimated by discounting the future cash flow using the Company&#x2019;s current borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of debt. The fair value of the long term promissory note approximates the carrying value as it was issued in December of 2013.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to five years.Revenue RecognitionThe Company evaluates multiple element revenue arrangements under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC&#xA0;605-25,Multiple-Element Arrangements. In addition to the form of the arrangement, the substance of the arrangement is also considered in determining whether separate agreements entered into, at or near the same time, that include elements that are interrelated or interdependent should be treated as one multiple-element arrangement. If the Company concludes that separate agreements represent one arrangement, then all the elements in the separate agreements are combined into one multiple-element arrangement for accounting purposes.Revenues from non-refundable license fees are recognized upon receipt of the payment if the license has stand-alone value, we do not have ongoing involvement or obligations, and we have determined the best estimate of the selling price for any undelivered items. When non-refundable license fees do not meet all of these criteria, the license revenues are recognized over the expected period of performance.We will periodically review our expected period of substantial involvement under the agreements that provide for non-refundable up-front payments and license fees. We will adjust the amortization periods when appropriate to reflect changes in assumptions relating to the duration of our expected involvement. We could accelerate revenue recognition for non-refundable upfront payments or license fees in the event of an early termination of the agreements. Alternatively, we could decelerate such revenue recognition if our period of involvement is extended. While changes to such estimates have no impact on our reported cash flows, our reported revenue is significantly influenced by our estimates of the period over which our obligations are expected to be performed and, therefore, over which revenue will be recognized.&#xA0;Revenues associated with substantive, at-risk milestones pursuant to our licensing agreements are recognized upon achievement of the milestones. We consider a milestone to be substantive at the inception of the arrangement if it is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, it relates solely to past performance and it is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. Non-refundable contingent future amounts receivable in connection with future events specified in our licensing agreements that are not considered milestones will be recognized as revenue when payments are earned by our counterparties through completion of any underlying performance obligations, the amounts are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.Comprehensive Income (Loss)On January 1, 2012, the Company adopted the new presentation requirements under Accounting Standards Update (&#x201C;ASU&#x201D;) 2011-05, &#x201C;Presentation of Comprehensive Income&#x201D;. Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, on our marketable securities which are also recognized as separate components of equity. ASU 2011-05 requires companies to present the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02,Comprehensive Income(Topic 220):Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which requires an entity to separately present the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for each component of AOCI and to disclose, for each affected line item in the income statement, the amount of AOCI that has been reclassified into that line item. This information must be provided either on the face of the financial statements by income statement line item, or in a footnote. For public companies, the amendments in the update became effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2012. As ASU 2013-02 and ASU 2011-05 impacted presentation only, neither had an effect on the Company&#x2019;s financial position nor results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Convertible Redeemable SharesIn accordance with ASC&#xA0;480,Distinguishing Liabilities from Equitythe Company determined that since the Series&#xA0;F shares are mandatorily redeemable for cash or for a variable, uncapped, number of common shares, they do not qualify for equity classification.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. They are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company is required to adjust its deferred tax liabilities in the period when tax rates or the provisions of the income tax laws change. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.'

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.&nbsp;Use of Estimates&nbsp;These consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. The Company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The Company bases its estimates on historical experiences and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management.&nbsp;&nbsp;Concentration of Credit Risk&nbsp;The Company maintains cash in one bank account which is fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company has not experienced any loss on this account.&nbsp;Fair Value of Financial Instruments&nbsp;The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, due to stockholders, note payable and convertible note payable approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.&nbsp;Income Taxes&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of FASB ASC 740, "Income Taxes." This pronouncement requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the enactment rate changes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&nbsp;The Company accounts for uncertainties in income taxes under the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10-05, "Accounting for Uncertainties in Income Taxes" The ASC clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#39;s financial statements. The ASC prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The ASC provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.&nbsp;Loss per share&nbsp;Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share give effect to dilutive convertible securities, options, warrants and other potential Common Stock outstanding during the period, only in periods in which such effect is dilutive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following securities have been excluded from the calculation of net loss per share, as their effect would be antidilutive:&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently Issued Accounting Standards&nbsp;Effective January 1, 2012, the Company adopted ASU 2011-04 (ASU 2011-04), "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011-04)." ASU 2011-04 clarifies application of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have a material effect on the Company&#39;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&nbsp;On July 18, 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists" ("ASU 2013-11"). ASU 2013-11 is expected to reduce diversity in practice by providing guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits and will better reflect the manner in which an entity would settle at the reporting date any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, or tax credit carryforwards exist. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2013. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2013-11 on its consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;Management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standard, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements&nbsp;Subsequent Events&nbsp;The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date of the filing.&nbsp;EndFragment'

S'NOTE 2 &#x2013; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#xA0;Development Stage Company&#xA0;The Company is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Although the Company has recognized nominal amount of revenue, the Company is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced. All losses accumulated since inception has been considered as part of the Company&#x2019;s development stage activities.&#xA0;Cash and Cash Equivalents&#xA0;For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers all cash on hand, cash accounts not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalent.&#xA0;Revenue Recognition&#xA0;The Company is in the development stage and has realized minimal revenues from operations. The Company recognizes revenues when the sale and/or distribution of products is complete, risk of loss and title to the products have transferred to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an agreement, acceptance has been approved by its customer, the fee is fixed or determinable based on the completion of stated terms and conditions, and collection of any related receivable is probable. Net sales will be comprised of gross revenues less expected returns, trade discounts, and customer allowances that will include costs associated with off-invoice markdowns and other price reductions, as well as trade promotions and coupons. The incentive costs will be recognized at the later of the date on which the Company recognized the related revenue or the date on which the company offers the incentive.&#xA0;Basic Income (Loss) Per Share&#xA0;The Company computes loss per share in accordance with &#x201C;ASC-260,&#x201D; &#x201C;Earnings per Share&#x201D; which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.&#xA0;Income Taxes&#xA0;The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to SFAS No. 109, &#x201C;Accounting for Income Taxes&#x201D; (&#x201C;SFAS No. 109&#x201D;). Under SFAS No. 109, now encompassed under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences.&#xA0;The Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets. Greenhouse Solutions establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the Company&#x2019;s financial position and results of operation for the current period. Future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period under the Federal tax laws.&#xA0;Changes in circumstances, such as the Company generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change estimate.&#xA0;Fair Value of Financial Instruments measured on a recurring basis&#xA0;The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#x201C;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#x201D;) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accept in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the in inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fail value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.&#xA0;The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.&#xA0;The carrying amount of the Company&#x2019;s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid rent, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and payroll taxes payable approximated their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.&#xA0;Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm&#x2019;s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representation about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm&#x2019;s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated. It is not however, practical to determine the fair value of advances from stockholders due to their related party nature.&#xA0;Deferred Offering Costs&#xA0;The Company defers as other assets the direct incremental costs of raising capital until such time as the offering is completed. At the time of completion of the offering, the costs are charged against the capital raised. Should the offering be terminated, deferred offering costs are charged to operations during the period in which the offering is terminated.&#xA0;Carrying Value, Recoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets&#xA0;The Company has adopted paragraph 360-10-35-17 of FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company&#x2019;s long-lived assets, which include office equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.&#xA0;The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair valued of those assets. Fair valued is generally determined using the assets expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The Company considers the following to be some examples of important indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant under-performance or losses of assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner or use of assets or in the Company&#x2019;s overall strategy with respect to the manner of use of the acquired assets or changes in the Company&#x2019;s overall business strategy; (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv) increased competitive pressures; (v) a significant decline in the Company&#x2019;s stock price for a sustained period of time; and (vi) regulatory changes. The Company evaluates acquired assets for potential impairment indicators at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of such events.&#xA0;The impairment charges, if any, is included in operating expenses in the accompanying statements of income and comprehensive income (loss).&#xA0;Common Stock Registration Expenses&#xA0;The Company considers incremental costs and expenses related to the registration of equity securities with the SEC, whether by contractual arrangement as of a certain date or by demand, to be unrelated to original issuance transactions. As such, subsequent registration costs and expenses are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as general and administrative expenses, and are expensed as incurred.&#xA0;&#xA0;Use of Estimates&#xA0;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.&#xA0;The Company&#x2019;s significant estimates include income taxes provision and valuation allowance of deferred tax assets; the fail value of financial instruments; the carrying value and recoverability of long-lived assets, and the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Those significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to those estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.&#xA0;Management regularly reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates.&#xA0;Subsequent Events&#xA0;The Company follows the guidance in Sections 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.&#xA0;Fair value of financial instruments&#xA0;The estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by management using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash approximate their fair value because of their short maturities.&#xA0;Stock-based Compensation&#xA0;The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to employees based on FASB accounting standard for Share Based Payment. It requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award &#x2013; the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). It requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The scope of the FASB accounting standard includes a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements including share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans.&#xA0;As at March 31, 2012 the Company had no stock-based compensation plans nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.&#xA0;Going Concern&#xA0;The Company&#x2019;s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred a net operating loss of $69,503 though the year ended March 31, 2012 and has not yet established an on going source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining the adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.&#xA0;In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management&#x2019;s plan is to obtain such resources of the Company by obtaining capital form management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplish any of its plans.&#xA0;The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary it the Company in unable to continue as a going concern.&#xA0;Recent pronouncements&#xA0;The Company has evaluated the recent accounting pronouncements through ASU 2012-09 and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the company&#x2019;s financial statements.'

S"NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company&#8217;s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, include the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect necessary adjustments not recorded in the books and records of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries to present them in conformity with GAAP.  Many of our estimates and assumptions involved in the application of GAAP may have a material impact on reported financial condition, and operation performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars.   Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  We base these estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.  These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.  Actual results may differ from management&#8217;s estimates.  The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions. Revenue Recognition In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) Staff Accounting Bulletin (&#8220;SAB&#8221;) Topic 13,Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenues when it is realized or realizable and earned.  The Company records revenues when the following four fundamental criteria under SAB Topic 13 are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as advances from customers on the balance sheet.  The Company did not have any advances from customers for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company negotiates contracts with its customers based on delivery schedule and price. The Company&#8217;s accounting policies are defined such that each delivery under a contract is accounted for separately. The Company derives the bulk of its revenue from sales of diesel, gasoline, fuel oil and solvents. These product sales revenues are recognized when customers take possession of goods in accordance with the terms of purchase order agreements that evidence agreed upon pricing and when collectability is reasonably assured. Cost of revenues for product sales include costs to purchase and transport the product to the Company and costs to deliver the goods to the customer. Agency fee revenues consist of fees, similar to a sales commission, charged to intermediaries who lack the required licenses to purchase directly from refineries, as well as the volume purchasing capability of the Company. Agency fee revenues are recognized when there is evidence of an arrangement that specifies pricing and irrevocable receipt of product and collection has occurred. Cost of agency fee service revenues consists of selling commission, transportation or other costs, if any, associated with the agency fee arrangement.  For the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, the Company stopped transporting or handling the products associated with the agency sales and only acted in a broker capacity allowing other intermediaries to use its licenses to take possession of the products.  The Company considers any costs associated with Agency fee revenues immaterial and has not allocated any costs to Agency fees for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Shipping and Handling Costs The Company&#8217;s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold for all periods presented. Sales Returns and Allowances The Company does not allow for the return of products and has no history of returns. Foreign Currency Translation and Other Comprehensive Income The accounts of the Company&#8217;s PRC subsidiaries are maintained in the PRC Renminbi (&#8220;RMB&#8221;) and the accounts of the US parent company are maintained in the US Dollar (&#8220;USD&#8221;).   The accounts of the PRC subsidiaries were translated into USD in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 830,Foreign Currency Matters, with the RMB as the functional currency for the PRC subsidiaries.  According to ASC 830, all assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date; stockholders&#8217; equity is translated at historical rates; and statement of income items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 220,Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. Total comprehensive income is defined as all changes in stockholders&#8217; equity during a period, other than those resulting from investments by and distributions to stockholders (i.e. issuance of equity securities and dividends).  Generally, for the Company, total comprehensive income equals net income plus or minus adjustments for currency translation. The gains and losses resulting from the translations of foreign currency transactions and balances are reflected in the statements of income. The total comprehensive income represents the activity for a period net of related tax and was a gain of $6,597,958 and $12,983,503 for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Accumulated other comprehensive income related to the foreign currency translation in the consolidated statement of shareholders&#8217; equity amounted to $31,772,020 and $25,174,062 as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The balance sheet amounts with the exception of equity at June 30, 2012 and 2011 were translated at RMB 6.3143 to $1.00 USD and RMB 6.4635 to $1.00 USD, respectively.  The average translation rates applied to income and cash flow statement amounts for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 were at RMB 6.3519 to $1.00 USD and RMB 6.6278 to $1.00 USD, respectively. Asset Retirement Cost and Obligation Asset retirement costs are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 410-20,Asset Retirement Obligations.  Pursuant to ASC 410-20, the Company recognizes the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation, which is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The fair value of the liability is estimated using projected discounted cash flows. In subsequent periods, the retirement obligation is accreted to its future value, which is the estimate of the obligation at the asset retirement date. The liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated or depleted over the useful lives of the respective assets.  If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, a gain or loss would be recognized at such time. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the consolidated balance sheets and cash flow statements, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained at financial institutions and state owned banks within the PRC and with a financial institution in the United States. Concentration of Risk Certain financial instruments, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist of cash.  The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions or state owned banks within the PRC, which do not provide for insurance against lost funds.  The Company also maintains cash balances at financial institutions which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits of $250,000 for banks located in the US.  Balances at financial institutions or state owned banks within the PRC are not insured and amounted to $11,168,560 and $7,940,056 at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  As of June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $76,944 and $1,356,410, respectively, in deposits in excess of federally insured limits in its US bank.  The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash in bank accounts. The Company operates in the PRC, which may give rise to significant foreign currency risks from fluctuations and the degree of volatility of foreign exchange rates between the USD and RMB. The Company&#8217;s operations are carried out in the PRC.  Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environments in the US and PRC, and by the general state of the economy in the PRC.  The Company&#8217;s operations in the PRC are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in the US.  These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environments and foreign currency exchange.  The Company&#8217;s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things. For the year ended June 30, 2012, no customers accounted for more than 2.7% of total revenues.  At June 30, 2012 the Company had 26 customers with open accounts receivable balances and the largest customer balance was 7.3% of total accounts receivable.  For the year ended June 30, 2011, no customers accounted for more than 2.8% of total revenues.  At June 30, 2011 the Company had 30 customers with open accounts receivable balances and the largest customer balance was 8.7% of total accounts receivable.  At June 30, 2012 and 2011 all accounts receivable were within current trade terms. For the year ended June 30, 2012, five suppliers individually accounted for more than 10% of our annual purchases, but in no case more than 19.3% of annual purchases.  These five suppliers collectively accounted for 80.8% (approximately $339.2 million) of the Company&#8217;s purchases.  As of June 30, 2012, $-0- was due to these suppliers.  For the year ended June 30, 2011, five suppliers individually accounted for more than 10% of our annual purchases, but in no case more than 18.6% of annual purchases.  These five suppliers collectively accounted for 83.0% (approximately $330.1 million) of the Company&#8217;s purchases.  As of June 30, 2011, $-0- was due to these suppliers.     As of June 30, 2012, five suppliers individually accounted for more than 10% of our advances to suppliers balance, but in no case more than 12.4% of the total balance.  These five suppliers collectively accounted for 59.0% (approximately $64.8 million) of the Company&#8217;s advances to suppliers balance.  As of June 30, 2012, the Company had a total of ten refinery supplier accounts with open balances of advances to suppliers.  As of June 30, 2011, five suppliers individually accounted for more than 10% of our advances to suppliers balance, but in no case more than 16.0% of the total balance.  These five suppliers collectively accounted for 65.7% (approximately $37.9 million) of the Company&#8217;s advances to suppliers balance.  As of June 30, 2011, the Company had a total of ten refinery supplier accounts with open balances of advances to suppliers.  The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its advances to suppliers and believes it is not exposed to any risks on its advanced account balances with suppliers. The Company is susceptible to credit risk on accounts receivable from customers and advances to suppliers.  Generally, the Company does not obtain security from its customers or vendors in support of these accounts. Payments of dividends may be subject to some restrictions due to the fact that the operating activities are conducted in subsidiaries residing in the PRC. Accounts Receivable Trade receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off as incurred.  The Company&#8217;s policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable.  Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable on a monthly basis and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves.  As of June 30 2012 and 2011, the Company determined that no reserve for accounts receivable was necessary.  The Company also has no off-balance sheet exposure related to its customers. Advances to Suppliers Advances to suppliers represent cash paid in advance for purchases of inventory direct from suppliers, which are petroleum refineries.  The Company locks in availability and pricing with suppliers in advance by using the Company&#8217;s cash resources.  The Company expects to maintain this level of supplier advances in the future to ensure that the Company has access to adequate supplies and timely shipments to act as a hedge based on the movement of industry pricing. The deposits are held by the Company&#8217;s suppliers to ensure that the delivery of inventory to the Company is made in a timely manner. The Company attempts to maintain a significant balance on account with suppliers with the expectation of receiving preferential pricing and delivery from the petroleum refineries.  The balance of &#8220;advances to suppliers&#8221; is reduced and reclassified to &#8220;inventory&#8221; when inventory is received and passes quality inspection.  The Company makes the advances without collateral for such prepayments.  As a result, the Company&#8217;s claims for such advances would rank only as an unsecured claim, which exposes the Company to the credit risks of the suppliers.  The Company does not foresee any potential loss with regard to these advances as a result of the suppliers being large enterprises that have significant controls placed upon them by PRC regulation.  The Company has not had to make any historical adjustments to these accounts for any deficiencies or negative impact related to the Company&#8217;s suppliers. Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average basis, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. When inventories are sold, their carrying amount is charged to expense in the year in which the revenue is recognized. Write-downs for declines in net realizable value or for losses of inventories are recognized as an expense in the year the impairment or loss occurs. There were no declines in net realizable value of inventory for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are located at the Company&#8217;s facilities in Taiyuan and Gujiao in the Shanxi Province of the PRC and are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of the asset, after the asset is placed in service. Major repairs and betterments that significantly extend original useful lives or improve productivity are capitalized and depreciated over the period benefited.  Maintenance and repairs are generally expensed as incurred.  When plant and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. The estimated useful lives for each major category of fixed assets are as follows:  Costs incurred during the construction and installation of the assets are initially capitalized as construction in progress and transferred into property, plant and equipment when the assets are ready for their intended use, at which time depreciation commences.  No depreciation charge is provided in respect to construction in progress. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 360,Property, Plant, and Equipment, and FASB ASC Topic 205Presentation of Financial Statements, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.  This analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to be generated from such assets. ASC 360 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets&#8217; carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal. Based on its review, the Company believes that as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, there was no impairment of its long-lived assets. Intangibles The Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 350,Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to record goodwill and intangible assets.  In accordance with ASC 350, certain intangible assets are to be assessed periodically for impairment using fair value measurement techniques. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of the end of the Company's fiscal year, or more frequently when impairment indicators arise. The Company evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and takes into account events and circumstances which indicate that impairment exists.  No goodwill or intangible assets were recorded as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Land Use RightsLand use rights represent the exclusive right to occupy and use the land in the PRC for a specified contractual term.  Land use rights are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization.  Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the life of the land use right.  In the PRC land for industrial use typical has land use rights for 50 years from date of original issuance.  The Company does not recognize land use rights for the land at its Taiyuan facility, which was contributed by the government and has 34 years remaining on its land use right.  The Company does not recognize land use rights for the land at its Gujiao facility, which was deemed immaterial at the time of acquisition and has five years remaining on its land use rights.  The Company has the first right to renew its land use rights for its current business purposes.  No land use rights were recorded as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740,Income Taxes,we provide for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not.  Taxation on profits earned in the PRC has been calculated on the estimated assessable profits for the year at the rates of taxation prevailing in the PRC in which the Company operates after taking into effect the benefits from any special tax credits or &#8220;tax holidays&#8221; allowed in the country of operations. The Company accounts for income tax under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 740,Income Taxes, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of the events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for all significant temporary differences between tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities.  Valuation allowances are established against net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  No material deferred tax amounts were recorded at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. Enterprise Income Tax On March 16, 2007, the PRC National People&#8217;s Congress passed the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (&#8220;New EIT Law&#8221;) which became effective on January 1, 2008.  Pursuant to the New EIT Law, a unified enterprise income tax rate of 25% and unified tax deduction standards will be applied consistently to both domestic-invested enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises. Deferred tax assets are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  Deferred tax assets are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect of deferred tax assets of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets.  The components of the deferred tax assets are individually classified as current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A provision has not been made at June 30, 2012 for US or additional foreign withholding taxes of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is the present intention of management to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely in foreign operations.  Generally, such earnings become subject to US tax upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability on such undistributed earnings. The Company recognizes that virtually all tax positions in the PRC are not free of some degree of uncertainty due to tax law and policy changes by the PRC.  However, the Company cannot reasonably quantify political risk factors and thus must depend on guidance issued by current PRC officials. Based on all known facts and circumstances and current tax law, the Company believes that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2012, is not material to its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  The Company also believes that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2012, if recognized, would not have a material effect on its effective tax rate.  The Company further believes that there are no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible, based on current PRC tax law and policy, that the unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease over the next 12 months producing, individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Value Added Tax The Provisional Regulations of the PRC Concerning Value Added Tax promulgated by the State Council came into effect on January 1, 1994.  Under these regulations and the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Regulations of the PRC Concerning Value Added Tax, value added tax is imposed on goods sold in or imported into the PRC and on processing, repair and replacement services provided within the PRC. Value added tax payable in the PRC is charged on an aggregated basis at a rate 17% for the Company&#8217;s Products on the full price collected for the goods sold or, in the case of taxable services provided, at a rate of 17% on the charges for the taxable services provided, but excluding, in respect of both goods and services, any amount paid in respect of value added tax included in the price or charges, and less any deductible value added tax already paid by the taxpayer on purchases of goods and services in the same financial year. Taxation on profits earned in the PRC has been calculated on the estimated assessable profits for the year at rates of taxation prevailing in the municipalities in the PRC in which the Company operates. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under FASB ASC subtopic 718-10,Compensation   Stock Compensation: Overall.  Under FASB Subtopic 718-10, the Company measures the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognizes the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period.  The amount of cost recognized is adjusted to reflect the number of share options that are forfeited prior to vesting. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees of the Company in accordance with the provisions of ASC Subtopic 505-50,Equity: Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.  All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.  The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the date on which the counterparty&#8217;s performance is completed.The Company does not currently have any formal stock option program, but does have a shareholder approved 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;), covering 400,000 shares common stock.  The Plan was designed to provide the board of directors compensation structure to establish performance incentive programs for executives, key employees and consultants.  To date the Company has awarded certain officers, directors and consultants stock grants.  For the year ended June 30, 2012, the Company issued 138,000 shares of restricted common stock to officers, directors and consultants accounted for as stock-based compensation.  For the year ended June 30, 2011, the Company issued 147,000 shares of restricted common stock to officers, directors and consultants accounted for as stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation costs that have been included in operating expenses amounted to $164,640 and $902,145 for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  During the year ended June 30, 2011, $315,570 related to the 147,000 shares issued during the period for stock-based compensation and $586,575 related to previously issued shares in the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 recognized as stock-based compensation expense in the year ended June 30, 2011 was recorded to adjust deferred stock-based compensation. Non-Cash Equity Transactions Shares of equity instruments issued for non-cash consideration are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received based on the market value of services to be rendered, or at the value of the stock given, considered in reference to contemporaneous cash sale of stock. Compensated Absences Employees of the Company are entitled to be compensated for absences depending on job classification, length of service, and other factors.  At June 30, 2012 and 2011 the amounts were not significant. Employee Benefit Costs According to PRC regulations on pensions, a company contributes to a defined contribution retirement plan organized by the municipal government in the province in which the subsidiary is registered and all qualified employees are eligible to participate in the plan.  Contributions to the plan are calculated at 30% of the employees&#8217; salaries above a fixed threshold amount.  The Chinese government is responsible for the benefit liability to retired employees.  The Company has no other material obligation for the payment of retirement beyond the annual contribution. Advertising The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred or, as appropriate, the first time the advertising takes place.  Advertising costs for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 were not significant. Research and Development The Company expenses the cost of research and development as incurred.  Research and development costs for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 were not significant. Accounting for Derivatives The Company evaluates stock options, stock warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC Topic 815-40,Derivative Instruments and Hedging: Contracts in Entity&#8217;s Own Equity.  The result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability.  In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense.  Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.  Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815-40 are reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies the provisions of accounting guidance, FASB Topic ASC 825 that requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.  As of June 30, 2012 and 2011 the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable and other payables approximated carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates except for related party debt or receivables for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value. Fair Value Measurements Effective January 1, 2009, the FASB ASC Topic 825Financial Instruments, requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments. To clarify the definition of fair value for financial reporting, the Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Subtopic 820-10,Fair Value Measurements(FASB Statement No. 157,Fair value Measurements), for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for the fair value measurements of non financial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements.  FASB ASC Subtopic 820-10 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. FASB ASC Subtopic 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurement for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. FASB ASC Subtopic 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  FASB ASC Subtopic 820-10 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities.  These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.    The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs.  The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared.  The Company had a warrant derivative liability carried at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2012. The following are the major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as reported during the year ended June 30, 2012, using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1); significant other observable inputs (Level 2); and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).  A financial asset or liability&#8217;s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction.  For many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion.  For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment. Valuation Techniques The Company&#8217;s financial assets valued based upon Level 2 inputs are comprised of detached common stock purchase warrants, namely the stock warrants issued in connection with the Company&#8217;s October 2009 Financing.  The Company estimated the fair value of the derivative liabilities using a Lattice Pricing Model and available information that management deems most relevant.  Among the factors considered in determining the fair value of financial instruments are discounted anticipated cash flow, the cost, terms and liquidity of the instrument, the financial condition, operating results and credit ratings of the issuer or underlying company, the quoted market price and trading history of similarly traded securities, and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of financial instruments. The Company did not identify any other non-recurring assets and liabilities that are required to be presented in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in accordance with ASC 825. Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share Earnings per share are calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260,Earnings Per Share.  Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares, stock options, warrants and other equity awards were converted or exercised during the period. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for warrants and options and as-converted method for preferred stocks. Under the treasury stock method, warrants and options are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.  In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.Segment Reporting The Company uses the management approach in determining operating segments.  The management approach considers the internal organization and reporting used by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker for making operating decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance as the source of determining the Company&#8217;s reportable operating segments.  The Company&#8217;s chief executive officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker.  The Company has determined that it has two reportable operating segments as defined by FASB ASC Subtopic 280-10,Segment Reporting: Overall, which are the wholesale distribution of petroleum products, wherein the Company takes possession of the product, and agency fees earned as a sales commission, wherein the Company does not take possession of the product.Statement of Cash Flows In accordance with ASC Topic 230,Statement of Cash Flows, cash flows from the Company&#8217;s operations are calculated based upon the local currencies using the average translation rates. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2011 consolidated financial statement to conform to the 2012 consolidated financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income or cash flows as previously reported. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (the Codification). The Codification became the single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental U.S. GAAP. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position or results of operations. Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) ASU No. 2010-09 (ASC Topic 855), which amends Subsequent Events Recognition and Disclosures, ASU No. 2009-16 (ASC Topic 860), which amends Accounting for Transfer of Financial Assets, ASU No. 2009-05 (ASC Topic 820), which amends Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures - Overall, ASU No. 2009-08, Earnings per Share, ASU No. 2009-12(ASC Topic 820), Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share, and various other ASU&#8217;s No. 2009-2 through ASU No. 2012-03 which contain technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance to specialized industries or entities were recently issued.  These updates have no current applicability to the Company or their effect on the financial statements would not have been significant. Other accounting standards have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements."

S'NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those results. Segment Information ASC 280 requires companies to report information about operating segment in interim and annual financial statements. It also requires segment disclosures about products and services geographic and major customers. The Company has determined that it does not have any separately reportable operating segments. Advertising and Promotion Costs Costs associated with advertising and promotions are expensed as incurred. The Company did not incur any advertising and promotion costs for the years ended February 28, 2014 and 2013. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair values of the Company&#8217;s accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the relatively short maturities of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company&#8217;s short and long term debt approximates fair value based on management&#8217;s best estimate of the interest rates that would be available for similar debt obligations having similar terms at the balance sheet date. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company adopted ASC 740-10-25, Income Taxes- Overall-Recognition, on January 1, 2007, which provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax position. The Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company did not recognize any additional liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10-25. Net Loss per Share The Company calculates its basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding shares to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive warrants and options and convertible securities.'

S'1.&nbsp;Nature of Operationsand Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesNature of OperationsGold Resource Corporation (the &#x201C;Company&#x201D;) was organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on August&nbsp;24, 1998.&nbsp;The Company is a producer of metal concentrates that contain gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc at itsEl AquilaProject in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico.&nbsp;TheEl AguilaProject includes theEl Aguilaopen pit mine, which ceased operations in February 2011, and theLa Aristaunderground mine, which is currently in operation.The Company is also performing exploration and evaluation work on its portfolio of base and precious metal exploration properties in Mexico and is evaluating other properties for possible acquisition elsewhere.Significant Accounting PoliciesExploration Stage Company:&nbsp;The Company has not yet demonstrated the existence of proven or probable reserves at itsEl AguilaProject in Oaxaca, Mexico or any of its other properties under the criteria set forth by the SEC and is therefore considered an exploration stage company in accordance with Guide 7.&nbsp; As a result, substantially all of its investment in mining properties to date, including construction of the mill, mine facilities, reclamation and remediation obligations and mine construction expenditures, have been expensed as incurred, and will continue to be expensed as incurred until such time as mineralized material is classified as proven or probable reserves.&nbsp;Certain expenditures, such as for rolling stock or other general-purpose equipment, may be capitalized, subject to evaluation of the possible impairment of the asset. Although for purposes of ASC 915Development Stage Entities, the Company commenced its intended operations of mining, processing and selling mineralized material in July 2010, the Company believed that its characterization as an exploration stage company under Guide 7 required it to report its financial statements consistent with a development stage company which required among other thingsthe reporting of inception to date results of operations, cash flows and other financial information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to certain comments raised by the SEC staff regarding the Company&#x2019;s financial statement presentation, the Company has determined that it is no longer required to include the inception to date reporting in its financial statements even though it remains an exploration stage company for accounting purposes in accordance with Guide 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Company has revised its financial statement presentation in this report to omitthe inception to date reporting in its consolidated statement of&nbsp;&nbsp;operations, consolidated statement of cash flows and other financial information, which differs from the presentation in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. The Company will not exit the exploration stage for accounting purposes unless and until it demonstrates the existence of proven or probable reserves that meet SEC guidelines and will continue to expense its activities as described above until such time as it exits the exploration stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please see the Cautionary Note at the beginning of this report for other information regarding our status as an exploration stage company.&nbsp;Proven or Probable Reserves: The definition of proven or probable reserves is set forth in SECIndustry Guide 7. Proven reserves are reserves for which (a)&nbsp;quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (b)&nbsp;grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (c)&nbsp;the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established. Probable reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. In addition, reserves cannot be considered proven or probable until they are supported by a feasibility or other study, indicating that the reserves have had the requisite geologic, technical and economic work performed and are economically and legally extractable at the time of the reserve determination. As of December 2013, none of the Company&#x2019;s mineralized material met the definition of proven or probable reserves.Basis of Presentation:&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements included herein are expressed in United States dollars, and conform to United States generally accepted accounting principles (&#x201C;U.S. GAAP&#x201D;). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned Mexican subsidiary, Don David Gold Mexico S.A. de C.V. (&#x201C;Don David Gold Mexico&#x201D;).&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.Use of Estimates:&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.&nbsp;Management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.&nbsp; Actual results could differ from these estimates.Reclassifications:&nbsp;Certain amounts presented in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.&nbsp;The reclassifications had no effect on the Company&#x2019;s net income(loss).Cash and Cash Equivalents:&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances and highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less when purchased and are carried at cost.&nbsp;Fair Value of Financial Instruments: Fair value accounting under ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold and Silver Bullion:From time to time, the Company may purchase gold and silver bullion on the open market in order to diversify its treasury and provide for an alternative form of payment for dividends.The purchased gold and silver bullion is carried at the lower of average purchase cost or quoted market value prices based on the daily London P.M.fixas of the balance sheet date.&nbsp;Accounts Receivable:&nbsp;Accounts receivable consists of trade receivables from the sale of metals concentrate.Inventories: Major types of inventories includemineralized materialstockpile inventories, concentrate inventories and materials and supplies, as described below. Inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, in the case ofmineralized materialstockpile inventories and materials and supplies. The net realizable value ofmineralized materialstockpile inventories represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on current and long-term metals prices, less the estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. Concentrate inventories are carried at the lower of full cost of production or net realizable value based on current metals prices. Write-downs of inventory are reported as a component of production costs applicable to sales.Mineralized Material&nbsp;Stockpile Inventories&nbsp;Mineralized materialstockpile inventories represent mineralized materials that have been mined and are available for further processing.Mineralized materialstockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tonnes added and removed from the stockpile, an estimate of the contained metals (based on assay data) and the estimated metallurgical recovery&nbsp;rates. Costs are allocated tomineralized materialstockpile inventories based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling themineralized material, including applicable overhead, depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations.&nbsp;Material is removed from the stockpile at an average cost per tonne. The current portion ofmineralized materialstockpiles is determined based on the expected amounts to be processed within the next 12 months.Mineralized materialstockpile inventories not expected to be processed within the next 12 months, if any, are classified as long-term.&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, all underground minemineralized materialstockpile inventory was classified as current and all open pit minemineralized materialstockpile inventory was classified as non-current.Concentrate InventoriesConcentrates inventories include metal concentrates located either at the Company&#x2019;s facilities or in transit to its customer&#x2019;s port. Inventories consist of copper, lead and zinc metal concentrates, which also contain gold and silver mineralization.Materials and Supplies Inventories&nbsp;Materials and supplies inventories are carried at cost not in excess of their estimated net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and freight. Inventories consist of chemical reagents, parts, fuels and other materials and supplies.&nbsp;IVA Taxes Receivable and Payable:&nbsp;In Mexico, value added taxes (IVA) are assessed on purchases of materials and services and sales of products. Businesses are generally entitled to recover the taxes they have paid related to purchases of materials and services, either as a refund or as a credit against future taxes payable. Likewise, businesses owe IVA taxes as the business sells a product and collects IVA taxes from its customers.Amounts recorded as IVA taxes payable in the consolidated financial statements represent the net estimated IVA tax liability, since there is a legal right of offset of IVA taxes receivable and payable.&nbsp;Mineral Acquisition Costs:&nbsp;The costs of acquiring land and mineral rights are considered tangible assets.&nbsp;Significant acquisition payments are capitalized.&nbsp;Administrative and holding costs to maintain an exploration property are expensed as incurred.&nbsp;If a mineablemineraldeposit&nbsp;is discovered, such capitalized costs are amortized when production begins using the units-of-production method.&nbsp;If no mineablemineraldeposit&nbsp;is discovered or such rights are otherwise determined to have diminished value, such costs are expensed in the period in which the determination is made.Exploration Costs:&nbsp;Exploration costs are charged to expense as incurred.&nbsp;Costs to identify new mineral resources, to evaluate potential resources, and to convert mineral resources into proven or probable reserves are considered exploration costs.Design, Facilities and Mine Construction Costs:&nbsp;Certain costs to design and construct mine and processing facilities may be incurred prior to establishing proven or probable reserves.&nbsp;Under these circumstances, the Company classifies a project as an exploration stage project and expenses substantially all costs, including design, engineering, construction and installation of equipment.&nbsp;Certain types of equipment, which have alternative uses or significant salvage value, may be capitalized.&nbsp;If a project is determined to contain proven or probable reserves, costs incurred in anticipation of production can be capitalized.&nbsp;Such costs include mine construction drilling to further delineate themineralized material, removing overburden during the pre-production phase, building access ways, constructing facilities, and installing equipment.&nbsp;Interest costs, if any, incurred during the construction phase, would be capitalized until the assets are ready for their intended use.&nbsp;The cost of start-up activities and ongoing costs to maintain production are expensed as incurred.&nbsp;Costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment.If a project commences commercial production and the project is determined to contain proven or probable reserves, amortization and depletion of capitalized costs is computed on a unit-of&#x2013;production basis over the expected reserves of the project based on estimated recoverable gold equivalent ounces.Property and Equipment:&nbsp;All items of property and equipment are carried at cost not in excess of their estimated net realizable value.&nbsp;Normal maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while expenditures for major maintenance and betterments are capitalized.&nbsp;Gains or losses on disposition are recognized in operations.&nbsp;Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using straight-line methods over the estimated economic lives, as follows:&nbsp;Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:&nbsp;The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset.&nbsp;Any impairment losses are measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows and are charged to income on the Company&#x2019;s consolidated statements of operations. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups. The Company&#x2019;s estimates of future cash flows are based on numerous assumptions, including expected gold and other commodity prices, production levels, capital requirements and estimated salvage values. It is possible that actual future cash flows will be significantly different than the estimates, as actual future quantities of recoverable minerals, gold and other commodity prices, production levels and costs and capital are each subject to significant risks and uncertainties. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company&#x2019;s mineral resources do not meet the definition of proven or probable reserves or value beyond proven or probable reserves and any potential revenue has been excluded from the cash flow assumptions.&nbsp;Accordingly, recoverability of capitalized cost is based primarily on estimated salvage values or alternative future uses.&nbsp;Asset Retirement Obligation/Reclamation and Remediation:&nbsp;The Company&#x2019;s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations, including legal and contractual obligations to reclaim, remediate, or otherwise restore properties at the time the property is removed from service.&nbsp;A liability is initially recorded at the estimated present value for an obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.&nbsp;For exploration stage properties that do not qualify for asset capitalization, the costs associated with the obligation are charged to operations.&nbsp;For construction and production stage properties that have proven or probable reserves, the costs are added to the capitalized costs of the property and amortized using the units-of-production method.&nbsp;Since none of the company&#x2019;s properties contain proven or probable reserves as defined by the SEC, the costs associated with the obligation are charged to operations. See Reclamation and Remediation below.Treasury Stock:&nbsp;Treasury stock represents shares of the Company&#x2019;s common stock which has been repurchased on the open market at the prevailing market price at the time of purchase. Treasury stock is shown at cost as a separate component of equity as a deduction from total capital stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue Recognition:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of concentrates are recorded net of treatment and refining charges, plus final settlement and mark-to-market price adjustments. &nbsp;Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments that are fixed and applied on a per tonne, pound or ounce basis, and in some cases provide for an increase in charges based on increases in metal prices above a base price. Treatment and refining charges are estimated upon shipment of concentrates based on contractual terms, with adjustments made at final settlement.&nbsp; Adjustments at final settlement typically do not vary materially from estimates made upon shipment; however, mark-to-market price adjustments could vary materially based on the precious metals market.&nbsp; In addition, because a portion of the metals contained in concentrates are unrecoverable as&nbsp;a result of the smelting process, the Company&#x2019;s revenues from sales of concentrates are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and value of these estimated unrecoverable metals.&nbsp; These allowances are negotiated with the buyer of the Company&#x2019;s concentrates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Production Costs:Production costs include labor and benefits, royalties, concentrate shipping costs, mining subcontractors, fuel and lubricants, legal and professional fees related to mine operations, stock-based compensation attributable to mine employees, materials and supplies, repairs and maintenance, explosives, housing and food, insurance, reagents, travel, medical services, security equipment, office rent, tools and other costs that support our mining operations.&nbsp;Stock-Based Compensation:&nbsp;The Company records compensation expense for the fair value of stock options that are granted.&nbsp;Expense is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the vesting periods, if any, of the options. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions including expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected life of the option dividend yields and expected forfeitures and cancellations.&nbsp;Expected volatility is based on the historical price volatility of the Company&#x2019;s common stock.&nbsp;Risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. government obligations with a term approximating the expected life of the option. The expected life is estimated in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107, &#x201C;Share-Based Payment&#x201D;.&nbsp;The Company paid dividends beginning in July 2010 and, accordingly, a dividend yield was considered in calculating the grant date fair value of options granted subsequent to that date; however, no dividend yield was considered for options granted prior to July 2010.In addition, the Company estimates the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to vest.&nbsp;Reclamation and Remediation:&nbsp;Reclamation obligations are recognized when incurred and recorded as liabilities at fair value. The&nbsp;liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to earnings. In addition, the asset retirement&nbsp;cost is expensed as incurred since we do not have proven or probable reserves. Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting&nbsp;from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the&nbsp;reclamation costs. The reclamation obligation is based on when spending for an existing disturbance&nbsp;will occur. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary, its&nbsp;reclamation obligations in accordance with ASC 410-20 guidance for reclamation obligations.&nbsp;Comprehensive Income (Loss):&nbsp;Total comprehensive income (loss) and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders&#x2019; Equity.&nbsp;Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation adjustment effects.Income Taxes:&nbsp;Income taxes are computed using the liability method.&nbsp;Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes and the effect of net operating loss and foreign tax credit carry-forwards.&nbsp;Deferred tax assets are evaluated to determine if it is more likely than not that they will be realized.Net Income (Loss) Per Share:&nbsp;Diluted income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if potentially dilutive securities, as determined using the treasury stock method, are converted into common stock.&nbsp;Potentially dilutive securities, such as stock options and warrants, are excluded from the calculation when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, such as periods when a net loss is reported or when the exercise price of the instrument exceeds the average fair market value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Currency:These consolidated financial statements are expressed in United States dollars (&#x201C;US dollars&#x201D;), which is the functional currency of the Company and the reporting currency of the consolidated financial statements. The functional currency of all of the Company&#x2019;s subsidiaries is also the US dollar.&nbsp;Translation of transactions and balances into the functional currency&nbsp;Transactions in currencies other than the Company&#x2019;s functional currency (&#x201C;foreign currencies&#x201D;) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Foreign currency non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost are not retranslated. Exchange differences are recognized in net earnings in the period in which they arise.&nbsp;Translation to the reporting currency&nbsp;At the end of each reporting period, the results and financial position of subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from the reporting currency of the Company are translated into US dollars as follows:&nbsp;Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from translation from the functional currency to the reporting currency are recognized in other comprehensive income and are recognized in net earnings or loss upon the substantial disposition, liquidation or closure of the subsidiary that gave rise to such amounts.Concentration of Credit Risk:During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, all of the Company&#x2019;s revenues and accounts receivable were the result of sales to two subsidiaries of the Trafigura Group Company: Consorcio Minero de Mexico Cormin Mex. S.A. de C.V. (&#x201C;Consorcio&#x201D;) and Trafigura Beheer, B.V. (&#x201C;Beheer&#x201D;) of Lucerne Switzerland. Sales to Consorcio and Beheer are made under separate contracts with different contract terms. The Company has carefully considered and assessed the credit risk resulting from its concentrate sales arrangements with Consorcio and Beheer and believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk in relation to the counterparty meeting its contractual obligations as it pertains to its trade receivables during the ordinary course of business. In the event that the Company&#x2019;s relationship with Consorcio or Beheer is interrupted for any reason, the Company believes that it would be able to locate another entity to purchase its metals concentrates.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, any interruption could temporarily disrupt the Company&#x2019;s sale of its principal products and adversely affect operating results.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#x2019;sEl AguilaProject, which is located in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, accounted for 100% of the Company&#x2019;s total sales of metals concentrate for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.&nbsp;Some of the Company&#x2019;s operating cash balances are maintained in accounts that currently exceed federally insured limits.&nbsp;The Company believes that the financial strength of depositing institutions mitigate the underlying risk of loss.&nbsp;To date, these concentrations of credit risk have not had a significant impact on the Company&#x2019;s financial position or results of operations.Recently Adopted Accounting Standards:&nbsp;In May 2011, ASC guidance was issued related to disclosures around fair value accounting. The updated guidance clarifies different components of fair value accounting including the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts, measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity&#x2019;s shareholders&#x2019; equity and disclosing quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in fair value measurements that are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company&#x2019;s January&nbsp;1, 2012 adoption of the updated guidance had no impact on the Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Recently Issued Accounting Standards Updates:&nbsp;In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income," or "ASU 2013-02" which requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income or loss. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012 andis&nbsp;notexpected tohavea material impact onthe Company&#x2019;sconsolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05 &#x201C;Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830): Parent&#x2019;s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity.&#x201D;The objective of ASU 2013-05 is to resolve the inconsistencies in practice about whether ASC Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation&#x2014;Overall, or ASC Subtopic 830-30, Foreign Currency Matters&#x2014;Translation of Financial Statements, applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity, or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets.This guidance is effective forreporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013 andis not expected to havea material impact on the Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, &#x201C;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists", or "ASU No. 2013-11" which requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, with limited exceptions. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013 and may be applied retrospectively. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2013-11 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.'

S"1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (policies):Organization&#x2013; Good Times Restaurants Inc. (Good Times or the Company) is a Nevada corporation. The Company operates through its wholly owned subsidiary Good Times Drive Thru Inc. (Drive Thru).Drive Thru commenced operations in 1986 and, as of September 30, 2012, operates twenty four company-owned and joint venture drive-thru fast food hamburger restaurants. &#xA0;The Company&#x2019;s restaurants are located in Colorado. In addition, Drive Thru has seventeen franchises, fourteen operating in Colorado, two in Wyoming and one in North Dakota, and is offering franchises for development of additional Drive Thru restaurants.We follow accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, commonly referred to as the &#x201C;FASB&#x201D;. The FASB sets generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Principles of Consolidation&#x2013; The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Good Times, its subsidiary and one limited partnership, in which the Company exercises control as general partner. The Company owns an approximate 51% interest in the limited partnership, is the sole general partner and receives a management fee prior to any distributions to the limited partner. &#xA0;Because the Company owns an approximate 51% interest in the partnership and exercises complete management control over all decisions for the partnership, except for certain veto rights, the financial statements of the partnership are consolidated into the Company&#x2019;s financial statements. &#xA0;The equity interest of the unrelated limited partner is shown on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the stockholders&#x2019; equity section as a non-controlling interest and is adjusted each period to reflect the limited partner&#x2019;s share of the net income or loss as well as any cash distributions to the limited partner for the period. The limited partner&#x2019;s share of the net income or loss in the partnership is shown as non-controlling interest income or expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. All inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated.Basis of Presentation&#x2013; The Company analyzes its operations on a regional basis, when evaluating closed restaurant operations for consideration as to the classification between continuing operations and discontinued operations. &#xA0;As most of the Company&#x2019;s restaurants are within the Denver metropolitan region and share common advertising, distribution, supervision, and to a certain extent even customers, the Company believes it appropriate to perform its analysis on a regional basis. During 2011 the Company closed two restaurants and in 2012, the Company has closed an additional two restaurants.&#xA0; The operations related to these restaurants are reflected as part of continuing operations as they were within one continuing operating region. The Company had minimal gains in connection with the sales of each of these restaurants and their combined operating losses were approximately $275,000 in 2011 and $158,000 in 2012.Accounting Estimates&#x2013; The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. &#xA0;Actual results could differ from those estimates.Reclassification&#x2013; Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year&#x2019;s presentation. &#xA0;Such reclassifications had no effect on the net income or loss.During the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 the Company incurred expenses of $15,000 and income of $22,000, respectively, and has a remaining lease liability of $82,000 as of September 30, 2012, related to a restaurant that was closed prior to 2011 and was previously classified as discontinued operations. Due to the insignificance of the amounts, the Company has reclassified such amounts as other expense in operations and as other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.Cash and Cash Equivalents&#x2013; The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.Accounts Receivable&#x2013; Accounts receivable include uncollateralized receivables from our franchisees and our advertising fund, due in the normal course of business, generally requiring payment within thirty days of the invoice date. On a periodic basis the Company monitors all accounts for delinquency and provides for estimated losses of uncollectible accounts. Currently and historically there have been no allowances for unrecoverable accounts receivable.Inventories&#x2013; Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, determined by the first-in first-out method, and consist of restaurant food items and related packaging supplies.Property and Equipment&#x2013; Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally three to eight years. Property and equipment under capital leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments and are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and expenditures for major improvements are capitalized. &#xA0;When assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the property accounts are relieved of costs and accumulated depreciation with any resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income.At September 30, 2012 we classified $1,380,000 as assets held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. These costs are related to a site in Firestone, Colorado which has been fully developed. Subsequent to September 30, 2012 we completed a sale lease-back transaction on the property. The $1,380,000 represents the fair market value of the assets. A charge of $61,000 is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations to adjust the assets to their fair market value. The net proceeds of $1,380,000 were used to pay down the PFGI II, LLC note payable by $765,000 and to purchase the real estate underlying an existing company-owned restaurant in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets&#x2013; We review our long-lived assets including land, property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the capitalized costs of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets and the expected cash flows are based on recent historical cash flows at the restaurant levelAn analysis was performed for impairment at September 30, 2012 and given the results of our analysis there were no restaurants which are impaired.Sales of Restaurants and Restaurant Equity Interests&#x2013; Sales of restaurants or non-controlling equity interests in restaurants developed by the Company are recorded under either the full accrual method or the installment method of accounting. &#xA0;Under the full accrual method, a gain is not recognized until the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and the earnings process is virtually complete without further contingencies. &#xA0;When a sale does not meet the requirements for income recognition, the related gain is deferred until those requirements are met. &#xA0;Under the installment method, the gain is incrementally recognized as principal payments on the related notes receivable are collected. &#xA0;If the initial payment is less than specified percentages, use of the installment method is followed.The Company accounts for the sale of restaurants when the risks and other incidents of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. &#xA0;Specifically, a) no continuing involvement by the Company exists in restaurants that are sold, b) sales contracts and related income recognition are not dependant on the future successful operations of the sold restaurants, and c) the Company is not involved as a guarantor on the purchasers&#x2019; debts.Deferred Liabilities&#x2013; Rent expense is reflected on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all leases containing step-ups in base rent. &#xA0;An obligation representing future payments (which totaled $283,000 as of September 30, 2012) is reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a deferred liability. &#xA0;Also included in the $652,000 deferred and other liabilities balance is a $282,000 deferred gain on the sale of the building and improvements of one Company-owned restaurant in a sale leaseback transaction. The building and improvements were subsequently leased back from the third party purchaser. The gain will be recognized in future periods in proportion to the rents paid on the twenty year lease.Opening Costs&#x2013; Restaurant opening costs are expensed as incurred.Advertising&#x2013; The Company incurs advertising expenses in connection with the marketing of its restaurant operations. &#xA0;Advertising costs are expensed when the related advertising begins.Franchise and Area Development Fees&#x2013; Individual franchise fee revenue is deferred when received and is recognized as income when the Company has substantially performed all of its obligations under the franchise agreement and the franchisee has commenced operations. &#xA0;The Company&#x2019;s commitments and obligations pursuant to the franchise agreements consist of a) development assistance; including site selection, building specifications and equipment purchasing and b) operating assistance; including training of personnel and preparation and distribution of manuals and operating materials. &#xA0;All of these obligations are effectively complete upon the opening of the restaurant at which time the franchise fee and the portion of any development fee allocable to that restaurant is recognized. &#xA0;There are no additional material commitments or obligations.The Company has not recognized any franchise fees that have not been collected. &#xA0;The Company segregates initial franchise fees from other franchise revenue in the statement of operations. &#xA0;Revenues and costs related to company-owned restaurants are segregated from revenues and costs related to franchised restaurants in the statement of operations.Continuing royalties from franchisees, which are a percentage of the gross sales of franchised operations, are recognized as income when earned. &#xA0;Franchise development expenses, which consist primarily of legal costs and restaurant opening expenses associated with developing and opening franchise restaurants, are expensed against the related franchise fee income.Income Taxes&#x2013; We account for income taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. Thedeferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability, and valuation allowances are adjusted as necessary. &#xA0;We believe it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized.The Company is subject to taxation in various jurisdictions. The Company continues to remain subject to examination by U.S. federal authorities for the years 2009 through 2012. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded. The Company's practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. No accrual for interest and penalties was considered necessary as of September 30, 2012.Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share&#x2013; Basic Earnings per Share is calculated by dividing the income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. &#xA0;Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Options for 175,289 and 166,022 shares of common stock, and warrants for 70,871 and 101,704 shares of common stock, were not included in computing diluted EPS for 2012 and 2011, respectively, because their effects were anti-dilutive.Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk&#x2013; Credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted. &#xA0;Concentrations of credit risk (whether on or off balance sheet) that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly effected by changes in economic or other conditions. &#xA0;Financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk to the Company include lease liabilities whereby the Company is contingently liable as a guarantor of certain leases that were assigned to third parties in connection with various sales of restaurants to franchisees (see Note 5).Financial instruments potentially subjecting the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of receivables. &#xA0;At September 30, 2012 notes receivable totaled $20,000 and are due from two entities. &#xA0;The Company has a $1,500,000 current receivable related to the preferred stock sale that occurred on September 28, 2012. The full $1,500,000 was received on October 1, 2012. Additionally, the Company has other current receivables totaling $145,000, which includes $64,000 of franchise receivables and $63,000 for a receivable from the advertising cooperative fund, which are all due in the normal course of business.The Company purchases 100% of its restaurant food and paper from one vendor. The Company believes a sufficient number of other suppliers exist from which food and paper could be purchased to prevent any long-term, adverse consequences.The Company operates in one industry segment, restaurants. &#xA0;A geographic concentration exists because the Company&#x2019;s customers are generally located in the State of Colorado.Comprehensive Income (Loss) &#x2013; Comprehensive income includes net income or loss, changes in certain assets and liabilities that are reported directly in equity such as adjustments resulting from unrealized gains or losses on held-to-maturity investments and certain hedging transactions.In May 2007, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, designated as a cash flow hedge, which hedges the Company&#x2019;s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the Company&#x2019;s floating rate $1,100,000 term loan. In fiscal 2008 the Company recorded the fair value of these contracts in the balance sheet, with the offset to other comprehensive loss. In fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2012 the fair value has been recognized in current earnings, as the cash flow hedge has been de-designated. The contract requires monthly settlements of the difference between the amounts to be received and paid under the agreement, the amount of which is recognized in current earnings as interest expense. See Note 3 for additional information.Stock-Based Compensation&#x2013; Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite employee service period (generally the vesting period of the grant). See Note 9 for additional information.Variable Interest Entities&#x2013; Once an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity (VIE), the party with the controlling financial interest, the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate it. &#xA0;The Company has two franchisees with notes payable to the Company. &#xA0;This franchisees are VIE&#x2019;s, however, the franchisees are the primary beneficiary of the entities, not the Company. &#xA0;Therefore they are not required to be consolidated.Fair Value of Financial Instruments&#x2013;Fair value, is defined under a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. See Note 8 for additional information. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in anorderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.The following three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value and requires that the assets or liabilities carried at fair value are disclosed by the input level under which they were valued.Non-controlling InterestsNon-controlling interests are presented as a separate item in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. The amount of consolidated net income or loss attributable to the non-controlling interests are clearly presented on the face of the consolidated income statement.Recent Accounting Pronouncements&#x2013; There are no current pronouncements that affect the Company."

S'Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2013-02, requiring the presentation of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to the respective line items in the statement of operations. For those amounts required by U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to earnings in their entirety in the same reporting period, this presentation is required either on the statement of operations or in a single footnote. For items that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to earnings, the presentation requirement can be met by cross-referencing disclosures elsewhere in the footnotes. For public companies, these amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The new guidance affects disclosures only and will have no impact on our results of operations or financial position. In January 2013, the FASB issued accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2013-01, to clarify the scope of ASU, No. 2011-11, issued in November 2011. ASU No. 2011-11 was issued to amend the disclosure requirements about offsetting assets and liabilities. The original guidance essentially clarified the FASB&#8217;s intent concerning the application of existing offsetting disclosure requirements. Entities were required to disclose gross and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions when those activities are subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. This scope was clarified and revised in January 2013 to only include derivatives, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements. The objective of this disclosure is to move toward consistency between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods and requires retrospective disclosures for all comparative periods presented. The adoption of this guidance will impact our financial statement disclosures, but it will not affect our financial position or results of operations. Recent accounting guidance not discussed above is not applicable, did not have, or is not expected to have a material impact to our business.'

S'(A)Nature of OperationsRemmington Enterprises, Inc. (an exploration\rstage company) (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 15, 2011. Remmington Enterprises,\rInc. is a precious metal mineral acquisition, exploration and development company. (B) Basis of PresentationThe Company is in the exploration stage\rin accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) Topic No. 915. These financial statements have been prepared\rin conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and include the have been consistently\rapplied in the preparation of the financial statements on a going concern basis, which assumes the realization of assets and the\rdischarge of liabilities in the normal course of operations for the foreseeable future. The Company has adopted a July 31 year\rend. (C) Use of EstimatesIn preparing financial statements in conformity\rwith generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\ramounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\rand expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (D) Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid\rtemporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At July 31, 2012, the Company\rhad no cash equivalents. (E) Exploration and Development CostsIn general, exploration costs are expensed\ras incurred. When the Company has determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing\rproven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized. Costs incurred to maintain current production\ror to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations. Costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon\rabandonment. During the year ended July 31, 2012, the Company recorded exploration costs of $560. (F) Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company accounts for its long-lived\rassets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10. ASC Topic 360-10 requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever\revents or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The\rCompany assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from\rthe asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment\rloss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset\'s carrying value and fair value or disposable value. During the period\rended July 31, 2012, no impairment was recognized. (G) Financial InstrumentsFinancial instruments consist of cash,\raccounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable and advances payable. Recorded values of cash, receivables, accounts payable\rand accrued liabilities approximate fair values due to the short maturities of such instruments. Recorded values for notes payable\rand related liabilities approximate fair values, since their stated or imputed interest rates are commensurate with prevailing\rmarket rates for similar obligations. (H) Loss Per ShareThe Company reports earnings (loss) per\rshare in accordance with ASC Topic 260-10. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common\rshareholders by the weighted average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to\rbasic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that\rwould have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. As\rof July 31, 2012, there were no potential common shares underlying warrants or options. (I) Revenue RecognitionThe Company currently has not generated\rrevenues. Any future revenues earned, primarily through the sale of extracted minerals, will be recognized utilizing the following\rgeneral revenue recognition criteria: 1) pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred; 3) the price to\rthe buyer is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery on mineral sales is determined\rto be complete for revenue recognition purposes when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer in accordance with stated\rcontractual terms and there is no future obligations related to the shipment. Title generally passes as the minerals are loaded\rinto transport carriers for delivery to the customer. (J) Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the\rasset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740-10. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future\rtax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities\rand their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted\rtax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or\rsettled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that\rincludes the enactment date. When it is considered to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a\rvaluation allowance is provided for the excess. (K) New Accounting StandardsWe do not believe there\rare any recently issued accounting standards that have not yet been adopted that will have a material impact on the Company&#146;s\rfinancial statements.'

S"NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of PresentationThese financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with US GAAP, and are presented in United States dollars. The Company has not produced revenues from its principal business and is an exploration stage company as defined by &#8220;Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises.&#8221;Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain of the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant areas of estimate include the carrying value of the mineral property and deferred income tax obligations. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company&#8217;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.Asset Retirement ObligationsThe Company records the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs an obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. The estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation is based on the current cost escalated at an inflation rate and discounted at a credit adjusted risk-free rate. This liability is capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset and amortized over its useful life.  The liability accretes until the Company settles the obligation.  To date the Company has not incurred any measurable asset retirement obligations.Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived AssetsThe carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsFair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk including the entity&#8217;s own credit risk.A fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs is established. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels and which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.These levels are:Level 1   inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.Level 2   inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3   inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management&#8217;s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.The Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist of cash, notes receivable, accounts payable and amounts due from related parties. The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair value based on their liquidity, their short-term nature or application of appropriate risk based discount rates to determine fair value. These financial assets and liabilities are valued using Level 3 inputs, except for cash which is at Level 1. The Company is not exposed to significant interest, exchange or credit risk arising from these financial instruments.Foreign Currency Translation and TransactionThe Company&#8217;s functional currency is the Canadian dollar and reporting currency is the United States dollar. The Company translates assets and liabilities to US dollars using year-end exchange rates, translates unproved mineral properties using historical exchange rates, and translates revenues and expenses using average exchange rates during the period. Gains and losses arising on settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the other comprehensive income. The Company has not to the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.Income TaxesIncome taxes are determined using the liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes that date of enactment.  In addition, a valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset for which it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes by applying a two-step method. First, it evaluates whether a tax position has met a more likely than not recognition threshold, and second, it measures that tax position to determine the amount of benefit, if any, to be recognized in the financial statements. The application of this method did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.Loss per ShareThe Company presents both basic and diluted loss per share (&#8220;LPS&#8221;) on the face of the statements of operations. Basic LPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted LPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including convertible debt, stock options, and warrants, using the treasury stock method. Diluted LPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.Mineral PropertiesThe Company classifies its mineral rights as tangible assets and accordingly acquisition costs are capitalized as mineral property costs. Mineral exploration costs are expensed as incurred until commercially mineable deposits are determined to exist within a particular property.When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs then incurred to develop such property, are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserves. If mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be charged to operations.Recently Adopted Accounting GuidanceThe Company has reviewed recently issued accounting pronouncements and plans to adopt those that are applicable to it. It does not expect the adoption of these pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows."

S'DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"Begin Block Tagged Note 3 - us-gaap:SignificantAccountingPoliciesTextBlock3) Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Star Gas Partners, L.P. and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Immaterial Balance Sheet Reclassification and RevisionThe accompanying September 30, 2011 balance sheet has been revised from its previous presentation to present certain insurance related assets and liabilities on a gross rather than net basis. The Partnership had recorded on a net basis insurance related receivables and payables for approved second injury fund reimbursements and for losses incurred that were in excess of the applicable self insured retention or deductible. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) permit a related asset and liability to be reported on a net basis only when a right of setoff exits, which includes all the conditions of having determinable amounts, rights to set off, intent and lawful enforceability. The Partnership should have grossed up its balance sheet for these amounts rather than offsetting them. This revision, which management has determined to be immaterial, had no impact on previously reported sales, operating expenses, working capital, operating cash flow, or cash position, but does affect certain components of our reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities. The revisions to present these insurance related receivables and payables on a gross basis are as follows: (in thousands) Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Revenue RecognitionSales of heating oil and other fuels are recognized at the time of delivery of the product to the customer and sales of heating and air conditioning equipment are recognized at the time of installation. Revenue from repairs and maintenance service is recognized upon completion of the service. Payments received from customers for equipment service contracts are deferred and amortized into income over the terms of the respective service contracts, on a straight-line basis, which generally do not exceed one year. To the extent that the Partnership anticipates that future costs for fulfilling its contractual obligations under its service maintenance contracts will exceed the amount of deferred revenue currently attributable to these contracts, the Partnership recognizes a loss in current period earnings equal to the amount that anticipated future costs exceed related deferred revenues.Cost of ProductCost of product includes the cost of heating oil, diesel, propane, kerosene, heavy oil, gasoline, throughput costs, barging costs, option costs, and realized gains/losses on closed derivative positions for product sales.Cost of Installations and ServiceCost of installations and service includes equipment and material costs, wages and benefits for equipment technicians, dispatchers and other support personnel, subcontractor expenses, commissions and vehicle related costs.Delivery and Branch ExpensesDelivery and branch expenses include wages and benefits and department related costs for drivers, dispatchers, garage mechanics, customer service, sales and marketing, compliance, credit and branch accounting, information technology, insurance, weather hedge contract costs and recoveries, and operational support.General and Administrative ExpensesGeneral and administrative expenses include wages and benefits and department related costs for human resources, finance and partnership accounting, administrative support and supply.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe allowance for doubtful accounts is the Partnership&#8217;s best estimate of the amount of trade receivables that may not be collectible. The allowance is determined at an aggregate level by grouping accounts based on the type of account and its receivable aging. The allowance is based on both quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience, historical collection patterns, overdue status, aging trends, and current economic conditions. The Partnership has an established process to periodically review current and past due trade receivable balances to determine the adequacy of the allowance. No single statistic or measurement determines the adequacy of the allowance. The total allowance reflects management&#8217;s estimate of losses inherent in its trade receivables at the balance sheet date. Different assumptions or changes in economic conditions could result in material changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Allocation of Net IncomeNet income for partners&#8217; capital and statement of operations is allocated to the general partner and the limited partners in accordance with their respective ownership percentages, after giving effect to cash distributions paid to the general partner in excess of its ownership interest, if any.Net Income per Limited Partner UnitIncome per limited partner unit is computed in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10-05 Earnings Per Share, Master Limited Partnerships (EITF 03-06), by dividing the limited partners&#8217; interest in net income by the weighted average number of limited partner units outstanding. The pro forma nature of the allocation required by this standard provides that in any accounting period where the Partnership&#8217;s aggregate net income exceeds its aggregate distribution for such period, the Partnership is required to present net income per limited partner unit as if all of the earnings for the periods were distributed, regardless of whether those earnings would actually be distributed during a particular period from an economic or practical perspective. This allocation does not impact the Partnership&#8217;s overall net income or other financial results. However, for periods in which the Partnership&#8217;s aggregate net income exceeds its aggregate distributions for such period, it will have the impact of reducing the earnings per limited partner unit, as the calculation according to this standard results in a theoretical increased allocation of undistributed earnings to the general partner. In accounting periods where aggregate net income does not exceed aggregate distributions for such period, this standard does not have any impact on the Partnership&#8217;s net income per limited partner unit calculation. A separate and independent calculation for each quarter and year-to-date period is performed, in which the Partnership&#8217;s contractual participation rights are taken into account.Cash, Accounts Receivable, Notes Receivable, Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings, and Accounts PayableThe carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, revolving credit facility borrowings, and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.Cash EquivalentsThe Partnership considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.InventoriesLiquid product inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method of accounting. All other inventories, representing parts and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or market using the FIFO method.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets using the straight-line method.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill and intangible assets include goodwill, customer lists, trade names and covenants not to compete.Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets in the acquisition of a company. In accordance with FASB ASC 350-10-05 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are annually tested for impairment. Also in accordance with this standard, intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment. The Partnership performs its annual impairment review during its fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill might be impaired.Customer lists are the names and addresses of an acquired company&#8217;s customers. Based on historical retention experience, these lists are amortized on a straight-line basis over seven to ten years.Trade names are the names of acquired companies. Based on the economic benefit expected and historical retention experience of customers, trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over seven to twenty years.Covenants not to compete are agreements with the owners of acquired companies and are amortized over the respective lives of the covenants on a straight-line basis, which are generally five years. Business CombinationsThe Partnership uses the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with FASB ASC 805 Business Combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires the Partnership to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date, and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which the amounts recognized for a business combination may be adjusted). Each acquired company&#8217;s operating results are included in the Partnership&#8217;s consolidated financial statements starting on the date of acquisition. The purchase price is equivalent to the fair value of consideration transferred. Tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition are recorded at the acquisition date fair value. The separately identifiable intangible assets generally are comprised of customer lists, trade names and covenants not to compete. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.Costs that are incurred to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration transferred, and are charged to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. For any given acquisition, certain contingent consideration may be identified. Estimates of the fair value of liability or asset classified contingent consideration are included under the acquisition method as part of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed. At each reporting date, these estimates are remeasured to fair value, with changes recognized in earnings.Impairment of Long-lived AssetsThe Partnership reviews intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-05-4 Property Plant and Equipment, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets subsection, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Partnership determines whether the carrying values of such assets are recoverable over their remaining estimated lives through undiscounted future cash flow analysis. If such a review should indicate that the carrying amount of the assets is not recoverable, the Partnership will reduce the carrying amount of such assets to fair value.Deferred ChargesDeferred charges represent the costs associated with the issuance of debt instruments and are amortized over the lives of the related debt instruments.Advertising and Direct Mail ExpensesAdvertising and direct mail costs are expensed as they are incurred. Advertising and direct mail expenses were $9.6 million, $9.5 million, and $9.6 million, in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively and are recorded in delivery and branch expenses.Customer Credit BalancesCustomer credit balances represent payments received in advance from customers pursuant to a balanced payment plan (whereby customers pay on a fixed monthly basis) and the payments made have exceeded the charges for liquid product and other services.Environmental CostsCosts associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution are expensed on a current basis. Accruals are made for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.Insurance ReservesThe Partnership uses a combination of insurance, self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks, including workers&#8217; compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and property. Reserves are established and periodically evaluated, based upon expectations as to what our ultimate liability may be for outstanding claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience, including frequency, severity, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions, supplemented with support from qualified actuaries.Income TaxesThe Partnership is a master limited partnership and is not subject to tax at the entity level for Federal and State income tax purposes. Rather, income and losses of the Partnership are allocated directly to the individual partners (the Partnership&#8217;s corporate subsidiaries are subject to tax at the entity level for federal and state income tax purposes). While the Partnership will generate non-qualifying Master Limited Partnership revenue through its corporate subsidiaries, distributions from the corporate subsidiaries to the Partnership are generally included in the determination of qualified Master Limited Partnership income. All or a portion of the distributions received by the Partnership from the corporate subsidiaries could be a dividend or capital gain to the partners. The accompanying financial statements are reported on a fiscal year, however, the Partnership and its Corporate subsidiaries file Federal and State income tax returns on a calendar year.As most of the Partnership&#8217;s income is derived from its corporate subsidiaries, these financial statements reflect significant Federal and State income taxes. For corporate subsidiaries of the Partnership, a consolidated Federal income tax return is filed. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence including historical tax losses, it is more likely than not that some or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized.Sales, Use and Value Added TaxesTaxes are assessed by various governmental authorities on many different types of transactions. Sales reported for product, installation and service excludes taxes.Derivatives and HedgingThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) ASC 815-10-05 Derivatives and Hedging, requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The Partnership has elected not to designate its derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance, and the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in our statement of operations.Weather Hedge ContractTo partially mitigate the adverse effect of warm weather on cash flows, the Partnership has used weather hedge contracts for a number of years. Weather hedge contracts are recorded in accordance with the intrinsic value method defined by FASB ASC 815-45-15 Derivatives and Hedging, Weather Derivatives (EITF 99-2). The premium paid is included in the caption prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying balance sheets and amortized over the life of the contract, with the intrinsic value method applied at each interim period.For the fiscal 2012 heating season, the Partnership had a weather hedge contract under which it was entitled to receive a payment of $35,000 per heating degree-day shortfall, when the total number of heating degree-days in the period covered is less than 92.5% of the ten year average (the &#8220;Payment Threshold&#8221;). The hedge covered the period from November 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012 taken as a whole, and had a maximum payout of $12.5 million. Temperatures for the period November 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012 taken as a whole met the Payment Threshold, and the heating degree-day shortfall during this period resulted in the Partnership contractually recovering the full $12.5 million, which was recorded as a reduction of expenses in the line item delivery and branch expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.In July 2012, the Partnership entered into a weather hedge contract for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015 with Swiss Re Financial Products Corporation under which we are entitled to receive a payment of $35,000 per heating degree-day shortfall, when the total number of heating degree-days in the period covered is less than 92.5% of the ten year average, the Payment Threshold. The hedge covers the period from November 1 through March 31 taken as a whole for each respective fiscal year and has a maximum payout of $12.5 million for each fiscal year.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Partnership adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) provisions of Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (&#8220;IFRS&#8221;). This standard provides for a consistent definition of fair value, and changes some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements under U.S. GAAP. There was no impact on our results of operations or the amount of assets and liabilities reported.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Partnership adopted the FASB provisions of ASU No. 2011-09, Compensation&#8212;Retirement Benefits&#8212;Multiemployer Plans (715-80): Disclosures about an Employer&#8217;s Participation in a Multiemployer Plan. This standard requires employers that participate in multiemployer pension plans to provide additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures such as significant multiemployer plan names, identifying number, employer contributions, an indication of the plan&#8217;s funded status, and the nature of the employer commitments to the plan. There was no impact on our results of operations or the amount of assets and liabilities reported. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This standard eliminates the option to present items of other comprehensive income (&#8220;OCI&#8221;) as part of the statement of changes in stockholders&#8217; equity, and instead requires either OCI presentation and net income in a single continuous statement to the statement of operations, or as a separate statement of comprehensive income. ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Partnership is required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. In August 2012, the FASB proposed ASU No. 2012-240, Presentation of Items Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This proposed standard would establish new requirements for disclosing reclassification of items out of OCI. The effective date for this proposed ASU No. 2012-240 is expected in fiscal 2013. The adoption of ASU No. 2011-05 or the proposed ASU No. 2012-240 will not impact our results of operations or the amount of assets and liabilities reported.In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This standard simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment by providing for an optional qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the first step, of the two-step goodwill impairment test. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Partnership has not early adopted this standard and is required to adopt this update in fiscal year 2013. The adoption of ASU No. 2011-08 will not impact our results of operations or the amount of assets and liabilities reported.'

S'Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated as part of the consolidation. Prior to the sale of the Company&#8217;s former specialty pharmaceutical business, assets and liabilities of the Company&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary were translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Currency translation adjustments were recorded in stockholders&#8217; equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Subsequent to the sale, the net assets (primarily cash) of the subsidiary were converted into U.S. dollars at current rates with fluctuations recognized in earnings. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include the carrying value of property and equipment, valuation of investments, legal and contractual contingencies, research and development expenses, stock-based compensation, and income taxes. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ from these estimates. Financial Instruments and Fair Value The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets approximated their fair values at December 31, 2012 and 2011 due to their short-term nature. Marketable securities are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Fair values and carrying amounts of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments at December 31, 2012 are indicated below (in thousands):  Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company held $50.5 million and $98.1 million of cash equivalents, respectively. Marketable Securities The Company classifies its investments in debt and equity securities as either short-term or long-term based upon their stated maturities and the Company&#8217;s ability and intent to hold them. Debt securities with stated maturities of one year or less are classified as current assets. Debt securities with stated maturities greater than one year are classified as noncurrent assets when the Company has the ability and intent to hold them for at least one year. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. Unrealized gains and losses (which are deemed to be temporary), net of related tax effect when appropriate, are included in the determination of other comprehensive income (loss) and reported in stockholders&#8217; equity. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization and accretion, along with realized gains and losses, are included in investment income, net. The cost of securities is based on the specific identification method. Notes Payable The carrying value of the Company&#8217;s 4% convertible senior unsecured notes outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $115.8 million and $129.5 million, respectively, and the fair value of these notes was $117.1 million and $129.8 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Fair value of the Company&#8217;s notes payable is based on quoted market prices. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost (reduced for any impairment charges), net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of fixed assets is provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations for the period. Amortization of leasehold improvements is calculated using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the lease or the life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred while significant improvements are capitalized. Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a property and equipment or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that property and equipment or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the property and equipment or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Deferred Debt Issuance Costs Costs incurred in issuing the Company&#8217;s notes payable have been recorded as deferred debt issuance costs and are included within the balances of other assets and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Such amounts are being amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the terms of the related financing. The amortization of deferred debt issuance costs is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. At the time of repurchase or other extinguishment of notes, a pro rata amount of deferred debt issuance costs is written off to interest expense. Upon conversion of notes, a pro rata amount of deferred issuance costs is written off against additional paid-in capital. Revenue Recognition Royalty revenue from the Company&#8217;s agreements with third parties is recognized when the Company can reasonably determine the amounts earned. In most cases, this will be upon notification from the third-party licensee, which is typically during the quarter following the quarter in which the sales occurred. The Company does not participate in the selling or marketing of products for which it receives royalties. No provision for uncollectible accounts is established upon recognition of revenues. Contingent payments due under the asset purchase agreement for the sale of the Company&#8217;s former specialty pharmaceutical business are recognized as income when the milestone has been achieved and collection is assured. Such payments are non-refundable and no further effort is required on the part of the Company or the other party to complete the earning process. The Company does not routinely participate in research and licensing arrangements that have multiple deliverables. The sale of the Company&#8217;s former specialty pharmaceutical business, however, did involve the application of the guidance regarding multiple deliverables in separating the revenues associated with the sale of in-process research and development from the other elements of the transaction, principally the assets sold as part of discontinued operations and the continuing involvement of the Company in contract research activities. The Company determined that the in-process research and development had value to the buyer of the Company&#8217;s former specialty pharmaceutical business on a stand-alone basis and that there was objective and reliable evidence available to support the allocation of the total purchase price to the respective units of accounting (see Note 22, Discontinued Operations). Research and Development Expenses All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These include the following types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities: preclinical research, clinical trials, clinical manufacturing costs, contract services, salaries, share-based compensation and benefits and administrative support costs. Non-refundable advance payments to acquire goods or pay for services that will be consumed or performed in future periods are capitalized and amortized over the period of expected benefit. Costs to acquire in-process research and development projects and technologies that have no alternative future use at the date of acquisition are expensed as incurred. Prior to the substantial suspension of the Company&#8217;s clinical development programs, substantial portions of the Company&#8217;s preclinical and clinical trial work were performed by third-party contract research organizations (CROs) and other vendors. The Company accrues expenses for costs for work performed by CROs based upon the estimated amount of the total effort completed on each study or project using factors such as the number of patients enrolled, the number of active clinical sites and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the study. Similar approaches are taken in estimating the percentage of completion in relation to contracts with contract manufacturing organizations. The Company bases the estimates on the information available at the time and records actual expenses as work is completed and invoiced. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates or laws on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date of the rate change. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized from operations. Tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to sustain a position taken on an income tax return. The Company has no liability for uncertain positions. Interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits, would be recognized as income tax expense. Concentrations of Risk The Company&#8217;s holdings of financial instruments are comprised principally of money market funds and debt securities. The Company does not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes. The Company seeks reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a reasonable rate of return. The Company&#8217;s market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company&#8217;s holdings of debt securities also are exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers. The Company typically invests the majority of its investments in the shorter-end of the maturity spectrum. At December 31, 2012 the portfolio had a weighted average effective maturity of less than a year and contained securities readily tradable in a market that enables flexibility in terms of timing of disposal. Cash equivalents are primarily held in a number of triple-A rated institutional money market funds as well as corporate debt securities. Stock-Based Compensation Plans The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based payment transactions at fair value. Compensation cost, measured by the fair value of the equity instruments issued, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is recognized in the financial statements as the respective awards are earned. The impact that share-based payment awards will have on the Company&#8217;s results of operations is a function of the number of shares awarded, the trading price of the Company&#8217;s stock at date of grant or modification and vesting, including the likelihood of achieving performance goals. Furthermore, the application of the Black-Scholes valuation model employs weighted average assumptions for expected volatility of the Company&#8217;s stock, expected term until exercise of the options, the risk free interest rate, and dividends, if any to determine fair value. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock; the expected term until exercise represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and the Company&#8217;s historical exercise patterns; and the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. Cash Flow Information Cash payments for interest on the Company&#8217;s 4% convertible notes were approximately $4.8 million, $5.4 million, and $5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There were $6,000, $0.2 million, and $0.1 million of income tax payments made for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company had a noncash conversion of $115.6 million principal amount of the 4% convertible notes into approximately 13.5 million shares of its common stock.'

S'Significant Accounting Policies Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Reverse Stock SplitOn February 6, 2014, the Company effected a1-for-6.5reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock and a proportional adjustment to the conversion ratio for the Company&#8217;s outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented in these financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect the reverse stock split and adjustment of the preferred share conversion ratios.Initial Public OfferingOn February 14, 2014, the Company completed its initial public offering of common stock (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;) pursuant to a registration statement that was declared effective on February 10, 2014. The Company sold3,100,000shares of its common stock, at a price of $12.00. The Company received a total of$33.4 millionin net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately $3.8 million. As of December 31, 2013, costs directly associated with the IPO were capitalized and recorded as deferred costs.  Upon closing of the IPO, these costs were recorded as a reduction of the proceeds received in arriving at the amount to be recorded as additional paid-in capital.In connection with the IPO,3,644,354shares of common stock were issued for the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred stock,1,197,289shares of common stock were issued for the conversion of outstanding convertible notes and accrued interest and593,589aggregate shares of common stock were issued in connection with the settlement of the Company&#8217;s outstanding preferred stock warrant liability.Warrant Liability Certain warrants to purchase the Company&#8217;s capital stock had historically been classified as liabilities and were recorded at estimated fair value. At each reporting period, any change in fair value of the freestanding warrants was recorded as other (expense) income. The preferred stock warrant liability was settled upon the closing of the IPO.Segment ReportingOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business inoneoperating segment.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.InvestmentsThe Company invests in money market funds and certificates of deposits and considers all investments purchased with original maturity dates greater than three months and less than one year to be short-term investments. Those investments with original maturity dates greater than one year at each balance sheet date are considered to be long-term investments. As of December 31, 2014, all investments were classified as available-for-sale and had original maturity dates less than one year. These investments are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders\' equity (deficit). The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which is included in interest income.Concentration of Credit RiskThe Company invests its available cash balances in bank deposits, money market funds and certificates of deposit. The Company maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. Management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held. Additionally, the Company has established guidelines regarding approved investments and maturities of investments, which are designed to maintain safety and liquidity.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Useful lives generally range fromthreetosevenyears.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsAs of December 31, 2014, financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, a note payable,  accounts receivable and accounts payable.The Company defines fair value (&#8220;FV&#8221;) as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ("the exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The FV hierarchy for inputs maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. The Company uses the following hierarchy of inputs to measure FV:&#8226;Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;The Company values investments using the most observable inputs available that are current as of the measurement date and classifies them according to the lowest level of inputs used. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed from market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are those which reflect the Company&#8217;s judgment concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed from the best information available under the circumstances.The Company targets investments principally in Level 1 and Level 2 cash equivalents and financial instruments and records them at FV. The Company did not rely on Level 3 inputs for the valuation of any investments at December 31, 2014. The Company expects that the carrying values of cash equivalents will approximate FV because of their short maturities.The Company classifies as Level 2 investments in certificates of deposits and values them using the market approach based on significant other observable inputs including quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar or quoted prices in markets that are not traded on a daily basis for identical or similar instruments.The following table sets forth our financial instruments carried at FV within the ASC 820 hierarchy and using the lowest level of input as of December 31, 2014:Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 were as follows: At December 31, 2013, certain warrants to purchase the Company&#8217;s capital stock were classified as liabilities and were recorded at estimated FV. The Company measured its warrant liability using significant unobservable inputs that were based on little or no verifiable market data, which is Level 3 in the FV hierarchy. At each reporting period, any change in fair value of the freestanding warrants was recorded as other (expense) income. The Company recorded a$140,000and$3.4 millionas other expense as as a result of the change in fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The preferred stock warrant liability was settled upon closing of the IPO.  As of December 31, 2014, the Company has no financial instruments that are valued using Level 3 inputs.Debt Issuance Costs    Debt issuance costs represent legal and other direct costs related to the Company\'s outstanding loan. These costs are recorded as an asset on the accompanying balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense utilizing the effective interest method through the earliest date at which the Company can be required to repay the notes. At December 31, 2014, the balance of debt issuance costs was$48,000.Research and Development CostsResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include personnel costs associated with research and development activities including non-cash share-based compensation, costs for third-party contractors to perform research, conduct clinical trials and manufacture drug supplies and materials. The Company accrues for costs incurred by external service providers, including contract research organizations and clinical investigators, based on its estimates of service performed and costs incurred. These estimates include the level of services performed by the third parties, patient enrollment in clinical trials, administrative costs incurred by the third parties, and other indicators of the services completed. Based on the timing of amounts invoiced by service providers, the Company may also record payments made to those providers as prepaid expenses that will be recognized as expense in future periods as the related services are rendered.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company estimates the FV of stock options and stock purchase rights using a Black-Scholes option valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option&#8217;s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The Company uses the simplified method for estimating the expected term as provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission\'s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined by examining the historical volatilities of a group of industry peers. The FV of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, and the resulting FV is expensed using the straight-line attribution method over the vesting period, which is the same as the requisite service period. Restricted stock units are measured at the FV of the Company\'s common stock on the date of grant and expensed over the period of vesting, which is the same as the requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method.Recent Accounting PronouncementsOccasionally, new accounting standards are issued or proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#8220;FASB&#8221;), or other standards-setting bodies that the Company adopts by the effective date specified within the standard. Unless otherwise discussed, standards that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements upon adoption.In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2013-11,Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. ASU 2013-11 provides explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, with an option for early adoption. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2014. The adoption did not impact the Company&#8217;s financial position or results of operations.In July 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10,Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest EntitiesGuidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The amendments in this ASU remove all incremental financial reporting requirements from U.S. GAAP for development stage entities, including the removal of Topic 915, Development Stage Entities, from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification&#8482;. A development stage entity is one that devotes substantially all of its efforts to establishing a new business and for which: (a) planned principal operations have not commenced; or (b) planned principal operations have commenced, but have produced no significant revenue. Current U.S. GAAP requires a development stage entity to present the same basic financial statements and apply the same recognition and measurement rules as established companies. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires a development stage entity to present inception-to-date information about income statement line items, cash flows, and equity transactions. For public business entities, the presentation and disclosure requirements in Topic 915 will no longer be required for the first annual period beginning after December 15, 2014. The revised consolidation standards are effective one year later, in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted the guidance for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2014.  The adoption did not impact the Company&#8217;s financial position or results of operations.In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-15, &#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221;(&#8220;ASU 2014-15&#8221;). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management&#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.  Specifically, ASU 2014-15 provides a definition of the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). It also requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated.  The new standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-14 on the Company\'s financial statements and disclosures.'

S'3. Significant accounting policiesThe accounting policies of the Company are in accordance with US GAAP applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year. Outlined below are those policies considered particularly significant.Principals of consolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its two subsidiaries, as noted in note 1. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.The Company&#8217;s subsidiaries functional currency is the Canadian dollar (CAD), while the Company&#8217;s reporting currency is the US dollar (USD). All transactions initiated in Canadian dollars are translated into US dollars in accordance with ASC 830, "Foreign Currency Translation" as follows:i)    Monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.ii)   Equity at historical rates.iii)  Revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period.Principals of consolidation (cont&#8217;d)Adjustments arising from such translations are deferred until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders&#8217; deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Therefore, translation adjustments are not included in determining net income (loss) but reported as other comprehensive income (loss).For foreign currency transactions, the Company translates these amounts to the Company&#8217;s functional currency at the exchange rate effective on the invoice date. If the exchange rate changes between the time of purchase and the time actual payment is made, a foreign exchange transaction gain or loss results which is included in determining net income for the period.Revenue recognitionThe Company recognizes revenue from the rendering of services when they are earned; specifically when all the following conditions are met:&#183;        the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to customers and the Company retains neither continuing involvement nor effective control;&#183;        there is clear evidence that an arrangement exists;&#183;        the amount of revenue and related costs can be measured reliably; and&#183;        it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company.In particular, the Company recognizes:&#183;        Fees for gastrointestinal clinical services, out-patient counseling, coaching, intervention, psychological assessments and other related services when patients receive the service; and&#183;        Fees for in-patient addiction treatments proportionately over the term of the patient&#8217;s treatment.Deferred revenue represents monies deposited by the patients for future services to be provided by the Company. Such monies will be recognized into revenue as the patient progresses through their treatment term. Rental income is recognized when on a straight-line basis over the term of the rental period, at which time title to the service, significant risks of ownership and ultimate collection is reasonably assured.Use of estimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recognition, measurement and disclosure of amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The reported amounts, including depreciation, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory, furniture and equipment additions, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, deferred revenue and note disclosures are determined using management\'s best estimates based on assumptions that reflect the most probable set of economic conditions and planned courses of action. Actual results will differ from such estimates.Non-monetary transactionsThe Company&#8217;s policy is to measure an asset exchanged or transferred in a non-monetary transaction at the more reliable measurement of the fair value of the asset given up and the fair value of the asset received, unless:i)    The transaction lacks commercial substance;ii)   The transaction is an exchange of a product or property held for sale in the ordinary course of business for a product or property to be sold in the same line of business to facilitate sales to customers other than the parties to the exchange;iii)  Neither the fair value of the asset received nor the fair value of the asset given up is reliably measurable; oriv)  The transaction is a non-monetary non-reciprocal transfer to owners that represents a spin-off or other form of restructuring or liquidation.CashThe Company\'s policy is to disclose bank balances under cash, including bank overdrafts with balances that fluctuate frequently from being positive to overdrawn and term deposits with a maturity period of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Accounts receivableThe Company\'s policy is to disclose accounts receivable net of a reserve for doubtful accounts.InventoryInventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method.Financial instruments The Company initially measures its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, except for certain non-arm\'s length transactions. The Company subsequently measures all its financial assets and financial liabilities at amortized cost. Financial assets measured at amortized cost include accounts receivable. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include bank indebtedness, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, harmonized sales tax payable, withholding taxes payable, convertible notes payable, loan payable and due to related party.Financial instruments (cont&#8217;d) Financial assets measured at cost are tested for impairment when there are indicators of impairment.  The amount of the write-down is recognized in net income. The previously recognized impairment loss may be reversed to the extent of the improvement, directly or by adjusting the allowance account, provided it is no greater than the amount that would have been reported at the date of the reversal had the impairment not been recognized previously. The amount of the reversal is recognized in net income. The Company recognizes its transaction costs in net income in the period incurred. However, financial instruments that will not be subsequently measured at fair value are adjusted by the transaction costs that are directly attributable to their origination, issuance or assumption.FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; andLevel 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.The Company does not have assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The Company did not have any fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.Fixed assetsFixed assets are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the declining balance method at the following annual rates: Computer equipment 30% Computer software 100%Furniture and equipment 30%Medical equipment 25%Vehicles 30%Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the term of the lease.  Half rates are used for all fixed assets in the year of acquisition.LeasesLeases are classified as either capital or operating leases.  Leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and inherent risks of ownership of property to the Company are accounted for as capital leases.  At the time a capital lease is entered into, an asset is recorded together with its related long-term obligation to reflect the acquisition and financing.  Equipment recorded under capital leases is amortized on the same basis as described above. Payments under operating leases are expensed as incurred.Income taxesThe Company uses the future income tax method to account for income taxes. Under this method, future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the carrying value and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities. Any change in the net amount of future income tax assets and liabilities is included in income. Future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on enacted or substantively enacted tax rates and laws which are expected to apply to the Company\'s taxable income for the periods in which the assets and liabilities will be recovered. Future income tax assets are recognized when it is more likely than not that they will be realized.Earnings per share information FASB ASC 260, &#8220;Earnings Per Share&#8221;provides for calculation of "basic" and "diluted" earnings per share.  Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity similar to fully diluted earnings per share.  Basic and diluted loss per share was the same, at the reporting dates, as there were no common share equivalents outstanding.Share based expensesASC 718"Compensation - Stock Compensation"codified SFAS No. 123 prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based payments awarded to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights that may be classified as either equity or liabilities. The Company should determine if a present obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction in cash or other assets exists. A present obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if: (a) the option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks commercial substance or (b) the present obligation is implied because of an entity\'s past practices or stated policies. If a present obligation exists, the transaction should be recognized as a liability; otherwise, the transaction should be recognized as equity.The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50"Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees"which codified SFAS 123 and the Emerging Issues Task Force consensus in Issue No. 96-18 ("EITF 96-18"),"Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services".Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction should be determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.'

S"SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany transactions and balances.EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and allowances for receivables and inventories.  These estimates are based on historical facts and various other factors, which the Company believes to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made. However, as the effects of future events cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from management&#8217;s estimates.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers cash invested in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.Marketable SecuritiesThe Company generally holds securities until maturity; however, they may be sold under certain circumstances including, but not limited to, when necessary for the funding of acquisitions and other strategic investments. As a result the Company classifies its investment portfolio as available-for-sale. The Company classifies all investments with a maturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase as short-term marketable securities in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. As ofDecember 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, the Company&#8217;s marketable securities consisted primarily of corporate bonds and other high-quality commercial securities. The weighted average interest rate of investments atDecember 31, 2015and December 31, 2014, was approximately0.84%and0.76%, respectively.Amortized cost and estimated fair market value of investments classified as available-for-sale (excluding cash equivalents) atDecember 31, 2015, were as follows:Amortized cost and estimated fair market value of investments classified as available-for-sale (excluding cash equivalents) atDecember 31, 2014, were as follows:    As of December 31, 2015, and 2014, there were no individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer.InventoriesInventories (which consist of costs associated with the purchases of wafers from domestic and offshore foundries and of packaged components from offshore assembly manufacturers, as well as internal labor and overhead associated with the testing of both wafers and packaged components) are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.  Provisions, when required, are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values.  Inventories consist of the following:Additional Components of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheet    Accounts receivable:    Prepaid expenses and other current assets:Property and Equipment        Property and equipment consist of the following:Depreciation expense for property and equipment for fiscal years endedDecember 31, 2015,2014and2013, was approximately$16.5 million,$15.9 millionand$16.1 million, respectively, and was determined using the straight-line method over the following useful lives:Total property and equipment (excluding accumulated depreciation) located in the United States atDecember 31, 2015,2014and2013, was approximately$150.1 million,$140.0 millionand$134.0 million, respectively. In2015and 2014, approximately12%and13%, respectively, of total property and equipment (excluding accumulated depreciation) was held in Thailand by one of the Company&#8217;s sub-contractors. In2013, no more than10%of total property and equipment was held in any foreign country.Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the three years endedDecember 31, 2015:_______________(1) This component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is included in the computation of net periodic pension cost for the years endedDecember 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.Business CombinationsThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is allocated to goodwill. The Company determines the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information, including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices and estimates made by management. The Company adjusts the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, during the measurement period of up to one year after the acquisition closing date as it obtains more information as to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date impacting asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill and the Company's domain name are evaluated in accordance with ASC 350-10,Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,and an impairment analysis is conducted on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators exist for a potential impairment.In accordance with ASC 360-10,Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.Employee Benefits PlanThe Company sponsors a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan for all employees in the United States who meet certain eligibility requirements.  Participants may contribute up to the amount allowable as a deduction for federal income tax purposes.  The Company is not required to contribute; however, the Company contributes a certain percentage of employee annual salaries on a discretionary basis, not to exceed an established threshold. In each of 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company provided for a contribution of approximately$1.1 million.Retirement Benefit Obligations (Pension)The Company recognizes the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit pension or post-retirement plan as an asset or liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders&#8217; equity, and are amortized as a component of net periodic cost over the remaining estimated service period of participants.Revenue RecognitionProduct revenues consist of sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), merchant power supply manufacturers and distributors. Approximately75%of the Company&#8217;s net product sales were made to distributors in2015. The Company applies the provisions of ASC 605-10,Revenue Recognition,and all related appropriate guidance. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred, (3) the price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the Company&#8217;s customer. The Company evaluates whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. With respect to collectability, the Company performs credit checks for new customers and performs ongoing evaluations of its existing customers&#8217; financial condition and requires letters of credit whenever deemed necessary.Sales to international OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers for shipments from the Company&#8217;s facility outside of the United States are pursuant to &#8220;EX Works&#8221; (EXW) shipping terms, meaning that title to the product transfers to the customer upon shipment from the Company&#8217;s foreign warehouse. Sales to international OEM customers and merchant power supply manufacturers that are shipped from the Company&#8217;s facility in California are pursuant to &#8220;delivered at frontier&#8221; (DAF) shipping terms. As such, title to the product passes to the customer when the shipment reaches the destination country and revenue is recognized upon the arrival of the product in that country. Shipments to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers in the Americas are pursuant to &#8220;free on board&#8221; (FOB) point of origin shipping terms meaning that title is passed to the customer upon shipment. Revenue is recognized upon title transfer for sales to OEMs and merchant power supply manufacturers, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.Sales to most of the Company's distributors are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments and rights of return on the Company's products held by its distributors. As a result of these rights, the Company defers the recognition of revenue and the costs of revenues derived from these sales until the Company's distributors report that they have sold the Company's products to their customers. The Company's recognition of such distributor revenue is based on point of sale reports received from the distributors, at which time the price is no longer subject to adjustment and is fixed, and the products are no longer subject to return to the Company except pursuant to warranty terms.  The gross profit that is deferred as a result of this policy is reflected as &#8220;deferred income on sales to distributors&#8221; in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The total deferred revenue as ofDecember 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, was approximately$25.7 millionand$25.0 million, respectively.  The total deferred cost as ofDecember 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, was approximately$10.6 millionand$9.8 million, respectively.Frequently, distributors need to sell at a price lower than the standard distribution price in order to win business. At or soon after the distributor invoices its customer, the distributor submits a &#8220;ship and debit&#8221; price adjustment claim to the Company to adjust the distributor's cost from the standard price to the pre-approved lower price. After verification by the Company, a credit memo is issued to the distributor for the ship and debit claim. The Company maintains a reserve for unprocessed claims and future ship and debit price adjustments.  The reserves appear as a reduction to accounts receivable and deferred income on sales to distributors in the Company's accompanying consolidated balance sheets. To the extent future ship and debit claims significantly exceed amounts estimated, there could be a material impact on the deferred revenue and deferred margin ultimately recognized.  To evaluate the adequacy of its reserves, the Company analyzes historical ship and debit payments and levels of inventory in the distributor channels.Sales to certain distributors of the Company are made under terms that do not include rights of return or price concessions after the product is shipped to the distributor.  Accordingly, product revenue is recognized upon shipment and title transfer assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.    Foreign Currency Risk and Foreign Currency TranslationAs ofDecember 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s primary transactional currency was U.S. dollars; in addition, the Company holds cash in Swiss francs and Euros to fund the operations of the Company&#8217;s Swiss subsidiary. The foreign exchange rate fluctuation between the U.S. dollar versus the Swiss franc and Euro is recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of income.Gains and losses arising from the re-measurement of non-functional currency balances are recorded in ''other income'' in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. For the years endedDecember 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 the Company realized foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) of$(0.5) million,$0.1 millionand$(0.1) million, respectively.The functional currencies of the Company&#8217;s other subsidiaries are the local currencies.  Accordingly, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates as of the applicable balance sheet date.  Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during the period.  Cumulative gains and losses from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries&#8217; financial statements have been included in stockholders&#8217; equity.WarrantyThe Company generally warrants that its products will substantially conform to the published specifications for12months from the date of shipment. The Company&#8217;s liability is limited to either a credit equal to the purchase price or replacement of the defective part.  Returns under warranty have historically been immaterial, and as a result, the Company does not record a specific warranty reserve.AdvertisingAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to$1.1 million,$1.5 million, and$1.4 million, in2015,2014and2013, respectively.    Research and DevelopmentResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.Income TaxesIncome tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carry-forwards that are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes.The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC 740,Income Taxes. Under the provisions of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, utilizing the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company recognizes valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets to the amount that it estimates will more likely than not be realized based on available evidence and management&#8217;s judgment. The Company limits the deferred tax assets recognized related to certain officers&#8217; compensation to amounts that it estimates will be deductible in future periods based upon Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). In the event that the Company determines, based on available evidence and management judgment, that all or part of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, it would record a valuation allowance in the period the determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial position.The Company engages in qualifying activities for R&amp;D credit purposes. On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 was signed into law, permanently extending the federal R&amp;D credit.During 2014, the Company settled with the IRS and closed out the examination of its income tax returns for the years 2007 through 2009. The resolution of the audit resulted in a federal tax benefit to the Company of$2.8 million; the Company also recorded a state tax benefit of approximately$0.5 million. The agreement with IRS also allowed the Company to repatriate$5.0 millionfrom its foreign subsidiary without incurring additional U.S. income taxes.Common Stock Repurchases and Common Stock DividendIn October 2012, the Company&#8217;s board of directors authorized the use of$50.0 millionfor the repurchase of the Company&#8217;s common stock. In 2014 and 2015, the Company&#8217;s board of directors authorized the use of an additional$75.0 millionand$60.0 million, respectively, for repurchase of the Company&#8217;s common stock, with repurchases to be executed according to pre-defined price/volume guidelines.NoShares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2013, as the stock price levels exceeded the pre-defined price guidelines mentioned above. In 2014, the Company purchased1.6 millionshares for approximately$80.8 million. In 2015, the Company purchased1.3 millionshares for$53.7 million. As ofDecember 31, 2015, the Company had$30.0 millionavailable for future stock repurchases. Authorization of future stock repurchase programs is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions as well as other factors.    The following table presents the quarterly dividends declared on the Company&#8217;s common stock for the periods indicated:The Company paid a total of approximately$13.9 million,$13.2 millionand$9.4 millionin cash dividends during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.    In January 2016, the Company&#8217;s board of directors declared a $0.13 quarterly dividend for each quarter in 2016. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of the Company&#8217;s stockholders.IndemnificationsThe Company sells products to its distributors under contracts, collectively referred to as Distributor Sales Agreements (DSA). Each DSA contains the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the distributor, and generally includes certain provisions for indemnifying the distributor against losses, expenses, and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the distributor in the event the Company&#8217;s products are found to infringe upon a patent, copyright, trademark, or other proprietary right of a third party (Customer Indemnification). The DSA generally limits the scope of and remedies for the Customer Indemnification obligations in a variety of industry-standard respects, including, but not limited to, limitations based on time and geography, and a right to replace an infringing product.  The Company also, from time to time, has granted a specific indemnification right to individual customers.    The Company believes its internal development processes and other policies and practices limit its exposure related to such indemnifications. In addition, the Company requires its employees to sign a proprietary information and inventions agreement, which assigns the rights to its employees' development work to the Company. To date, the Company has not had to reimburse any of its distributors or customers for any losses related to these indemnifications and no material claims were outstanding as ofDecember 31, 2015.  For several reasons, including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases, the Company cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, related to such indemnifications. Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition, ASU 2014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is required to adopt the amendments in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted; however, the Company is not permitted to adopt the standard earlier than January 1, 2017. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments and the transition alternatives on its consolidated financial statements.In July 2015, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for the measurement of inventory, ASU 2015-11,Inventory. The amendments require inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The Company is required to adopt the amendments in the first quarter of 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect that the adoption of these amendments will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In November 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on the classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities,  ASU 2015-17,Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The Company early adopted the new guidance as of the beginning of the year ended December 31, 2015 and have applied the amendments on a prospective basis. All deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015, have been classified as non-current in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. The adoption as of the beginning of the year resulted in a$2.2 milliondecrease to deferred tax liabilities, a$1.3 milliondecrease to non-current deferred assets and$0.9 millionincrease to non-current tax liabilities. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted."

S'Recent Account Pronouncements&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance which addresses the presentation of amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. This guidance does not change current financial reporting requirements. Instead, an entity is required to cross-reference to other required disclosures that provide additional detail about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, the guidance requires an entity to present significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by line item of net income if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. Adoption of this standard is required for periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2013. This new guidance impacts how the Company reports comprehensive income only, and had no effect on the Company\'s results of operations, financial position or liquidity during fiscal 2014 and 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", Topic 606. This ASU affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance in this ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to illustrate the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance also includes a set of disclosure requirements that will provide users of financial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a reporting organization\'s contracts with customers. This ASU is effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 for public companies. The Company is evaluating the effect, if any, on the Company\'s financial position and results of operations.'

S"2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Methods The Company recognizes income and expenses based on the accrual\rmethod of accounting. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts\rof Gamzio Mobile, Inc.  and I Like A Deal, LLC (ILAD). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been\reliminated in consolidation. Development Stage Enterprise The Company has not earned any revenue from operations since\rinception. Accordingly, the Company&#146;s activities have been accounted for as those of a &#34;Development Stage Enterprise&#34;\ras set forth in ASC 915, &#34;Development Stage Entities.&#34; Among the disclosures required by ASC 915, are that the Company&#146;s\rfinancial statements be identified as those of a development stage company, and that the statements of operations, stockholders'\requity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of the Company's inception. Dividend Policy The Company has not yet adopted a policy regarding payment\rof dividends. Basic and Diluted Net Income (loss) Per Share Basic net income (loss) per share amounts are computed based\ron the weighted average number of shares actually outstanding.   Diluted net income (loss) per share amounts are\rcomputed using the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding as if shares had been issued on the\rexercise of the common share rights unless the exercise becomes antidilutive and then the basic and diluted per share amounts are\rthe same. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 we had 7,263,240 and 0 common stock equivalents outstanding, respectively, related to convertible\rdebt Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically reviews its long term assets for\rimpairment and makes adjustments, if the carrying value exceeds fair value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciated\rover its estimated useful life. Furniture and Equipment The Company acquired office furniture and equipment during\rthe year ended December 31, 2013, of $2,550. Furniture and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over 3 years. Total\rdepreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $425. Computer Equipment The Company acquired computer and related equipment during\rthe year ended December 31, 2013, of $3,195. Computer equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over 3 years. Total depreciation\rexpense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $532. Income Taxes The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for\rincome taxes. Under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial\rreporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in\reffect, when the differences are expected to be reversed. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded, when it is more\rlikely than not, that such tax benefits will not be realized. Foreign Currency The books of the Company are maintained in United States\rdollars and this is the Company&#146;s functional and reporting currency.  Translations denominated in other than the\rUnited States dollar are translated as follows with the related transaction gains and losses being recorded in the Statement of\rOperations:    Revenue Recognition The Company earns revenue through consulting fees and from\rtransaction fees it charges customers. Consulting fees are recorded in revenue when the service is completed. Transaction fees\rare recorded in revenue when a customer completes a purchase on the Company&#146;s website and the related transaction fee is\rcharged to the customer&#146;s credit card. No revenues have been recognized to date. Advertising and Market Development The company expenses advertising and market development costs\ras incurred. Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments are considered\rby management to be their fair value due to their short term maturities. Estimates and Assumptions Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial\rstatements in accordance with general accepted accounting principles.  Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported\ramounts of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses.   Actual\rresults could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing these financial statements. Statement of Cash Flows For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company\rconsiders all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company does not expect the adoption of any other recent\raccounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial statements."

S'Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesRevenue RecognitionMRV\'s revenue-generating products consist of switches and routers, console management, physical layer products, and fiber optic components. We recognize product revenue, net of sales discounts, returns and allowances, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered reasonably assured. Products are generally shipped "FOB shipping point," with no right of return and revenue is recognized upon shipment. If revenue is to be recognized upon delivery, such delivery date is tracked through information provided by the third party shipping company we use to deliver the product to the customer.Sales of services and system support are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period. Sales to end customers with contingencies, such as rights of return, rotation rights, conditional acceptance provisions and price protection, are infrequent and insignificant and are deferred until the contingencies have been satisfied or the contingent period has lapsed. For sales to distributors, we generally recognize revenue when product is sold to the distributor rather than when the product is sold by the distributor to the end user. In certain circumstances, distributors have limited rights of return, including stock rotation rights, and/or are entitled to price protection, where a rebate credit may be provided to the customer if we lower our price on products held in the distributor\'s inventory.We estimate and establish allowances for expected future product returns and credits. We record a reduction in revenue for estimated future product returns and future credits to be issued to the customer in the period in which revenue is recognized, and for future credits to be issued in relation to price protection at the time we make changes to our distributor price book. We monitor product returns and potential price adjustments on an ongoing basis and estimate future returns and credits based on historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data, and other factors known at the time of revenue recognition.MRV collects sales taxes from its customers to remit to the applicable taxing authorities. These amounts are not included in revenues, but are included on the balance sheet in accrued liabilities.Amounts billed to customers in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling represent revenues earned for goods provided and are classified as revenue.  Shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.MRV generally warrants its products against defects in materials and workmanship for90days tothree-year periods. The estimated cost of warranty obligations and sales returns and other allowances are recognized at the time of revenue recognition based on contract terms and prior claims experience.Accounting for Multiple-Element Arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2011.Arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables involving combinations of equipment, services and software. In accordance withASC 605-25 Multiple-Element Arrangements, the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element is met. Fair value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is sold separately. If multiple element arrangements include software or software-related elements, we apply the provisions ofASC 985-605 Softwareto the software and software-related elements, or to the entire arrangement if the software is essential to the functionality of the non-software elements.Accounting for Multiple-Element Arrangements entered into or materially altered after January 1, 2011.We allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The selling price we use for each deliverable is based on (a) vendor-specific objective evidence if available; (b) third-party evidence if vendor-specific objective evidence is not available; or (c) best estimate of selling price if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. We allocate discounts in the arrangement proportionally on the basis of the selling price of each deliverable.Cash and Cash EquivalentsMRV treats highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less as cash equivalents. Investments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than 90 days and remaining time to maturity of one year or less as short-term and are included in restricted time deposits.  MRV maintains cash balances and investments in qualified financial institutions, and at various times such amounts are in excess of federal insured limits. As ofDecember 31, 2015, the Company\'s U.S. entities held$21.6 millionin cash and cash equivalents. The remaining$4.6 millionwas held by the company\'s foreign subsidiaries in foreign bank deposit accounts.Restricted Time DepositsRestricted time deposits represent investments that are restricted as to withdrawal or use and from time to time may include certificates of deposit. Restricted time deposits generally secure standby letters of credit, bank lines of credit, or bank loans. When investments in restricted time deposits are directly related to an underlying bank loan and the restricted funds will be used to repay the loans, the investment and the subsequent release of the restricted time deposit are treated as investing activities in the Company\'s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The other investments in and releases of restricted time deposits are included in investing activities because the funds are invested in certificates of deposit. As ofDecember 31, 2015, the Company held a$5.0 millioncertificate of deposit with a highly rated financial institution which matures in June 2016.Concentration of Credit Risk, Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents placed with high credit quality institutions and accounts receivable due from customers. Management evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. If management becomes aware of a customer\'s inability to meet its financial obligations after a sale has occurred, the Company records an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectable from the customer. If the financial conditions of MRV\'s customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsen, additional allowances may be required in the future. Accounts receivable are charged off at the point they are considered uncollectible.The following table summarizes the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):As ofDecember 31, 2015and 2014, one customer, accounted for15%and22%of gross accounts receivables, respectively.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and consist of material, labor and overhead. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. If management estimates that the net realizable value is less than the cost of the inventory, an adjustment to the cost basis is recorded through a charge to cost of sales to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value. At each balance sheet date, management evaluates the ending inventories for excess quantities or obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels and projections of future demand. Based on this evaluation, management writes down the inventory to net realizable value if necessary. At the time of recording the write-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of, or increase in, that newly established cost basis.Inventories, net of reserves, consisted of the following (in thousands):Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and the costs of additions and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. When property or equipment are disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in other income, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.Property and equipment, at cost, consisted of the following (in thousands):Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, as follows:Depreciation expense for the years endedDecember 31, 2015,2014and2013was$1.9 million,$1.9 millionand$1.6 million, respectively.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. The Company recorded an impairment charge of$0.1 millionduring the year endedDecember 31, 2014. The Company did not record any impairment charges for the years endedDecember 31, 2015and 2013. See Note 4"Intangible Assets"for further information.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsManagement evaluates its long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and other long-term assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be impaired. Management takes into consideration events or changes such as product discontinuance, plant closures, product dispositions and history of operating losses or other changes in circumstances to indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The carrying value of an asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Fair value is determined using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate based on our weighted average cost of capital, which represents the blended after-tax costs of debt and equity. There wasnoimpairment loss on long-lived assets during thethree yearsendedDecember 31, 2015.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsMRV\'s financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, restricted time deposits, accounts receivable, other receivables and  accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates their fair value. The fair values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.The Company follows a framework for measuring fair value, using a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the use of observable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is divided into three levels based on the source of inputs as follows: Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - Valuations for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, other than level 1 inputs for similar instruments;  Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.All of MRV\'s financial assets and a majority of its financial liabilities that are measured at fair value are measured using the unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the &#8220;exit price&#8221;) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Management has not elected the fair value option for non-financial assets and liabilities.As ofDecember 31, 2015and2014, the Company had cash equivalents consisting of money market funds of$1.8 millionand$10.6 million, respectively, that were classified as Level 1 investments and were quoted at market price.  Cash equivalents are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in thousands):During 2014, the Company updated the estimated fair value of250,000warrants originally recorded as a liability that was awarded to plaintiffs\' counsel on February 18, 2014 in a litigation matter, (see Note 9,Commitments and Contingencies). In calculating the fair value, Management used the Black Scholes option pricing model including a volatility of41%based on the Company\'s historical quoted prices and peer company data, the risk free interest rate of1.5%and the5 yearsexpected term of the warrants. Volatility based on both the Company\'s historical quoted prices and peer company data was used as the Company\'s stock is thinly traded.  The resulting fair value was$6.59per warrant. In relation to this revaluation, the Company recorded expense of$0.4 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2014. Upon issuance and revaluation, the warrants met the requirements necessary for equity classification and were removed from liabilities and recorded as a component of additional paid in capital.During the year ended December 31, 2014, one of plaintiffs\' counsel exercised152,500warrants under the \'cashless\' exercise provisions contained within the warrant agreement, leaving97,500warrants still available for future exercise. No warrants were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2015. The warrants expire on July 18, 2018.Other Current AssetsOther current assets include other accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets that will be consumed within a twelve month period. Other current assets as ofDecember 31, 2015included other accounts receivable of$4.8 millionrelated to the post-closing purchase price adjustment on the sale of Tecnonet and prepaid expenses of$1.2 millionand$0.9of other assets. Other current assets included pre-paid expenses of$1.2 millionand$1.5 millionof other assets as of December 31, 2014.Liability for Severance PayUnder the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions, MRV is obligated to make severance payments to employees in those foreign jurisdictions on the basis of factors such as each employee\'s current salary and length of employment. The liability for severance pay is calculated as the amount that the Company would be required to pay if every employee were to separate as of the end of the period, and is recorded as part of other long-term liabilities.Cost of SalesCost of sales includes material, depreciation on fixed assets used in the manufacturing process, shipping costs, direct labor and overhead.Product Development and EngineeringProduct development and engineering costs are charged to expense as incurred.Software Development CostsDevelopment costs related to software products for sale or to be included in our products are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product has been established. Technological feasibility occurs when a working model is completed. After technological feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalized. We believe that our process for internally developed software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility, and, accordingly,nosoftware development costs for internally developed software have been capitalized to date.Internal Use Software Development CostsAny software that we acquire, internally develop, or modify solely to meet our internal needs, and for which we have no substantive plan to market the software externally, is capitalized during the development phase. Costs incurred during the research phase are expensed as incurred. During theyear ended December 31,2013, we implemented a new enterprise-wide software for which we capitalized the development costs, the costs of which are included in property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no such costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing costs are charged to expense as incurred. For the years endedDecember 31, 2015,2014and2013, advertising and trade show costs were$0.4 million,$0.9 millionand$0.9 million, respectively.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.  In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.We use a risk based approach and analysis to identify potential tax exposures, estimate those tax exposures, and record appropriate uncertain tax liabilities based on whether or not the tax position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained under examination. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations if the sustainability of the uncertain tax position does not meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold based on its technical merits.  Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.Net Income (Loss) Per ShareBasic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock ("Common Stock") outstanding, including restricted shares which, although they are legally outstanding and have voting rights, are subject to vesting and are treated as common stock equivalents in calculating basic net income (loss) per share. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and dilutive potential shares of Common Stock from stock options and warrants outstanding during the period. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of in-the-money options, which is calculated based on the average share price for each period using the treasury stock method.Employee equity share options, non-vested shares and similar equity instruments granted by MRV, are treated as potential shares of common stock outstanding in computing diluted net income per share. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation cost for future service not yet recognized, and the amount of income tax benefits that would be realized and recorded in additional paid-in capital if the deduction for the award would reduce income taxes payable are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.Outstanding stock options to purchase295,366,309,309and325,837shares were excluded from the computation of dilutive shares for the years ended December 31,2015,2014and2013, respectively, as they were anti-dilutive because of the net loss from continuing operations. Treasury shares are excluded from the number of shares outstanding.Share-Based CompensationThe Company accounts for stock-based payment awards at fair value at the grant date. The estimated fair value of stock options and warrants are determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent MRV\'s best estimates. Those estimates may be impacted by certain variables including stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors, additional stock option grants, estimates of forfeitures, and the related income tax impact. Stock-based compensation cost is recorded as expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period.Recent Accounting PronouncementsWe consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (&#8220;ASUs&#8221;). The ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and/or results of operations.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. ASU 2014-09 was originally effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted after December 15, 2016. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact that adopting ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. The Company anticipates concluding its evaluation by December 31, 2016 and plans to adopt ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018.In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, &#8220;Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&#8221; (&#8220;ASU 2014-12&#8221;). The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 718, &#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 718&#8221;), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The amendments in ASU 2014-12 are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in ASU 2014-12 either: (i) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (ii) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of that adopting ASU 2014-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern" ("ASU 2014-15"). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management&#8217;s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the Company in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact that adopting ASU 2014-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory" (&#8220;ASU 2015-11&#8221;). ASU 2015-11 simplifies the guidance on the subsequent measurement if inventory, excluding inventory measured using the last-in, first out of the retail inventory method. Under the new standard, inventory should be at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact that adopting ASU 2015-11 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes" ("ASU 2015-17"). The amendments in ASU 2015-17 simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact that adopting ASU 2015-17 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases" ("ASU 2016-02"). The amendments in ASU 2016-02 requires companies that lease assets to recognize on their balance sheets the assets and liabilities for the  rights and obligations generated by contracts longer than a year. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied by the modified retrospective transition approach. Early adoption is permitted.  Management is currently evaluating the potential impact that adopting ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements require management to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, inventory valuation, accrued warranty, allowance for doubtful accounts, and accounting for income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.'

S'Note\r2 &#150; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis\rof Presentation The\raccompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\rUnited States of America (&#147;US GAAP&#148;) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\r(&#147;SEC&#148;). Principles\rof Consolidation The\rconsolidated financial statements include the accounts of FlikMedia, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Flikdate, Inc. All inter-company\raccounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of these consolidated statements. Use\rof Estimates The\rpreparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates\rand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\rat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual\rresults could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are\rreflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined. Cash\rand Cash Equivalents Cash\rand equivalents include cash in hand and cash in demand deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments\rwith original maturities of three months or less. Income\rTaxes The\rCompany accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, &#147;Income Taxes&#148;. Under FASB ASC 740, deferred income\rtaxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and\rtheir financial statement reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to\rthe periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary,\rto reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax expense\rfor the period, if any, and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The\rCompany has significant income tax net operating losses; however, due to the uncertainty of the realize-ability of the related\rdeferred tax asset and other deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance equal to the amount of deferred tax assets has been established\rat December 31, 2014 and 2013. FASB\rASC 740 also provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. A tax\rbenefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the position is sustainable\rbased on its technical merit. The\rCompany&#146;s federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2011, 2012 and 2013 remain subject to examination for federal\rand state taxes. Fair\rValue of Financial Instruments Disclosures\rabout fair value of financial instruments require disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in our consolidated\rbalance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of December 31, 2014, the amounts reported for cash, accrued\rliabilities and accrued interest approximated fair value because of their short maturities. In\raccordance with ASC Topic 820, &#147;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,&#148; we measure certain financial instruments at\rfair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance\rwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair\rvalue is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\rbetween market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes\rthe inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets\rfor identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).\rThese tiers include:  Property&#38;\requipment Property\rand equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of\rthe asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows:  Furniture\rand equipment consisted of the following at December 31, 2014 and 2013:  For\rthe years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, depreciation expense was $1,022 and $257, respectively. Intangible\rAssets The\rCompany records identifiable intangible assets at fair value on the date of acquisition and evaluates the useful life of each\rasset. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of software development capitalized. Finite-lived intangible assets are\ramortized on a straight-line basis and are tested for recoverability if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their\rcarrying amounts may not be recoverable. These intangibles have useful lives ranging from 1 to 10 years. No events or changes\rin circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of December 31, 2014. Valuation\rof Long-Lived Assets Long-lived\rassets include equipment and intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives. We assess the carrying value of our long-lived\rasset groups when indicators of impairment exist and recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset\ris not recoverable from the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Indicators\rof impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes\rin our use of the assets or in our business strategy, loss of or changes in customer relationships and significant negative industry\ror economic trends. When indications of impairment arise for a particular asset or group of assets, we assess the future recoverability\rof the carrying value of the asset (or asset group) based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If carrying value exceeds projected,\rnet, undiscounted cash flows, an additional analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the asset (or asset group), typically\ra discounted cash flow analysis, and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value over fair value. Research\rand Development Research\rand development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development.\rResearch and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate\rsoftware for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to\rsoftware development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached,\rwhich for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are put into service. Once technological feasibility\ris reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Research and\rdevelopment expense is included as an operating expense. Basic\rand Diluted Net Loss per Common Share Basic\rand diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders\rby the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Our potentially dilutive shares, which include\routstanding common stock warrants, have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common\rstockholders for all periods presented, as the results would be antidilutive. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when\rthe effect would be to reduce net loss per share.  Risks\rand Uncertainties The\rCompany is subject to risks from, among other things, competition associated with the industry in general, other risks associated\rwith financing, liquidity requirements, rapidly changing customer requirements and technologies and limited operating history. Contingencies Certain\rconditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will\ronly be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company&#146;s management and legal counsel assess\rsuch contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal\rproceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company&#146;s\rlegal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of\rthe amount of relief sought or expected to be sought. If\rthe assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability\rcan be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company&#146;s financial statements. If the assessment\rindicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be\restimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable\rand material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they\rinvolve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed. Goodwill Goodwill\rrepresents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill\ris not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of December 31, or more frequently if\revents or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Effective\rNovember 28, 2012, the Company adopted ASU 2011-08, which allows the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine\rwhether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This step serves as\rthe basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step test first compares\rthe fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment exists,\rand the second step is not performed. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is performed to compute\rthe amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.\rThe adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The\rCompany evaluated its goodwill for impairment on December 31, 2014, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Recently\rIssued Accounting Pronouncements In\rAugust 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements &#150; Going\rConcern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entities Ability to Continue as a Going Concern(ASU 2014-15).\rThe guidance in ASU 2014-15 sets forth management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an\rentity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern as well as required disclosures. ASU 2014-15 indicates that, when preparing\rfinancial statements for interim and annual financial statements, management should evaluate whether conditions or events, in\rthe aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date\rthe financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This evaluation should include consideration of conditions\rand events that are either known or are reasonably knowable at the date the financial statements are issued or are available to\rbe issued, as well as whether it is probable that management&#146;s plans to address the substantial doubt will be implemented\rand, if so, whether it is probable that the plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods\rending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company\ris currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. In\rJanuary 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-01, Income Statement &#150; Extraordinary and Unusual items\r(Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items (ASU 2015-01).\rThe amendment eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. This guidance is effective for the Company in the\rfirst quarter of fiscal 2017. Early adoption is permitted and allows the Company to apply the amendment prospectively or retrospectively.\rThe adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.'

S'1. NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&nbsp;a. Nature of the Business&nbsp;Learning Tree International, Inc. and subsidiaries (&#x201c;we,&#x201d; &#x201c;us,&#x201d; or &#x201c;our&#x201d;) develop, market, and deliver a broad proprietary library of instructor-led classroom courses that are designed to meet the professional development needs of information technology (&#x201c;IT&#x201d;) professionals and managers worldwide. These courses are delivered primarily at our leased education centers located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Sweden and Japan. Such course events are also conducted in hotel and conference facilities and at customer sites throughout the world. Approximately 90% of our course titles are also available to individuals located worldwide through Learning Tree AnyWare&#x2122;, our patent-pending live online learning interface that allows individuals at any location to attend a live instructor-led Learning Tree class via the Internet. Our courses provide both breadth and depth of education across a wide range of technical and management disciplines, including operating systems, databases, computer networks, computer and network security, web development, programming languages, software engineering, open source applications, project management, business skills, and leadership and professional development.&nbsp;We follow a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, with our quarter-end dates on the Friday nearest the end of the calendar quarter and our year-end dates on the Friday nearest the end of September. Accordingly, our fiscal year 2013 ended on September 27, 2013, and our fiscal year 2014 ended on October 3, 2014. Thus, these consolidated financial statements report our consolidated financial position as of September 27, 2013, and October 3, 2014 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders&#x2019; equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 27, 2013 and October 3, 2014. Fiscal year 2013 was a 52-week year, while fiscal year 2014 was a 53-week year.&nbsp;Certain items in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.&nbsp;b. Principles of Consolidation&nbsp;The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Learning Tree International, Inc. and our subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The following is a list of our subsidiaries:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning Tree International USA, Inc. (U.S.) &nbsp;Learning Tree International, K.K. (Japan) &nbsp;Learning Tree International Ltd. (United Kingdom) &nbsp;Learning Tree International S.A. (France) &nbsp;Learning Tree International AB (Sweden) &nbsp;Learning Tree International Inc. (Canada) &nbsp;Advanced Technology Marketing, Inc. (U.S.)AnyWare Live, Inc. (U.S.)&nbsp;c. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable&nbsp;Our revenues are received from business entities and government agencies for the professional training of their employees. Course events range in length from one to five days, and average approximately three and a half days. As stated above, we follow a 52- or 53-week fiscal year. This method is used in order to better align our external financial reporting with the way we operate our business. Since all courses have a duration of five days or less, and all courses begin and end within the same calendar week, under the 52- or 53-week fiscal year method all revenues and related direct costs for each course event are recognized in the week and the fiscal quarter in which the event takes place.&nbsp;We offer our customers a multiple-course sales discount referred to as a &#x201c;Learning Tree Training Passport&#x201d;. A Learning Tree Training Passport allows an individual Passport holder to attend up to a specified number of Learning Tree courses over a one or two-year period for a fixed price. During fiscal year 2012, we re-introduced for a limited time the Unlimited Training Passport which allowed an individual Passport holder to attend as many courses as they wanted by June 30, 2013. This Unlimited Passport program ended on June 30, 2013. For a Training Passport, the amount of revenue recognized for each attendance in a course is based upon the selling price of the Training Passport, the list price of the course taken, the weighted average list price of all courses taken and the estimated average number of courses Passport holders will actually attend. Upon expiration of each individual Training Passport, we record the difference, if any, between the revenues previously recognized and that specific Training Passport&#x2019;s total invoiced price. The estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average number of course events that Training Passport holders have been attending. The actual Training Passport attendance rate is reviewed at least semi-annually, and if the Training Passport attendance rates change, the revenue recognition rate for active Training Passports and for Training Passports sold thereafter is adjusted prospectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs, as the substantial majority of our Passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their Training Passport. We believe that the use of recent historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by Passport holders.&nbsp;The average attendance rate for all expired Training Passports has closely approximated the estimated rate we utilize. Although we have seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed, we monitor such potential effects. In general, determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a Training Passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future. These estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue. If the estimates are wrong, we would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that Training Passport and the Training Passport selling price upon expiration of that Training Passport. Thus, the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an inaccurate estimation, but the inaccuracy would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the one- to two-year life of each Training Passport.&nbsp;For Passport products for which historical utilization data is not available, we assume that the estimated average number of courses to be attended is equal to the number of courses available on the Passport. For the Unlimited Training Passport program, we utilize historical data to estimate the expected number of courses that would be attended. Assumed utilization rates may be revised in future periods after sufficient time has passed to amass additional historical trends.&nbsp;In addition to our Learning Tree Training Passports, we also offer a multiple-course sales discount referred to as Learning Tree Training Vouchers. With Learning Tree Training Vouchers, a customer buys the right to send a specified number of attendees to Learning Tree courses over a six to twelve-month period for a fixed price. Revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance. For the majority of Training Vouchers with unused seats at the expiration of the Voucher, we record the pro rata selling price of the expired unused seats as revenue. At times we make a business decision to extend a Training Voucher beyond the normal twelve month expiration date. Training Vouchers purchased under government rate schedules have no expiration date.&nbsp;Trade accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. We use estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, based on our analysis of various factors, including our historical collection experience, current trends, specific identification of invoices which are considered doubtful, and a percentage of our past due accounts receivable. These estimates could differ from actual collection experience and are subject to adjustment. Our trade accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible.&nbsp;d. Stock-Based Compensation&nbsp;We estimate the fair value of share-based option awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. We estimate the fair value of share-based restricted stock units and restricted stock grants using the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Our determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by assumptions regarding a number of variables, including our expected stock price volatility, expected term, dividend yield and risk-free interest rates.&nbsp;We analyzed our historical volatility to estimate the expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the U.S. Treasury rate at the date of grant, which most closely resembles the expected life of our options. The estimated expected life represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and has been determined based on the simplified method under Accounting Standards Codification (&#x201c;ASC&#x201d;) 718. We do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39&nbsp;&nbsp;As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated pre-vesting forfeitures. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience. The estimated forfeiture rates used for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 were zero.&nbsp;e. Course Development Costs&nbsp;Course development costs are charged to operations in the period incurred.&nbsp;f. Advertising&nbsp;Advertising costs are charged to expense in the period incurred. Advertising costs totaled $1,057 and $814 in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, respectively.&nbsp;g. Cash and Cash Equivalents, Available for Sale Securities, and Interest-bearing Investments&nbsp;&nbsp;We consider highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of ninety days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.&nbsp;We classify certain of our investments in marketable securities as &#x201c;available for sale&#x201d;. We do not have any investments classified as &#x201c;trading&#x201d; or &#x201c;held-to-maturity.&#x201d; Our policy is to invest cash with issuers that have high credit ratings and to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.&nbsp;As of October 3, 2014 and September 27, 2013, we had no available for sale securities.&nbsp;Restricted interest-bearing investments at October 3, 2014 consisted of cash deposits of $2,297 (1,439 British Pounds), $209 (1,519 Swedish Kroner) and $725 which were pledged as collateral to secure our obligations under leases for education center facilities located in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the United States, respectively. This compares to restricted interest-bearing investments of cash deposits of $2,725 (1,689 British Pounds) and $1,450 at September 27, 2013. The United Kingdom deposits are held in trust by the landlord with interest accruing to us and paid on an annual basis. The deposit will be released to us at the earlier of the end of the lease period or when certain financial ratios have been met. In the United States, the deposit is in a restricted account held by our bank and serves as collateral for a letter of credit issued to our landlord by our bank.&nbsp;h. Marketing Expenses&nbsp;Marketing expenses primarily include the external costs associated with the design, printing, postage, list rental and handling of direct mail advertising materials to be mailed in the future. These costs are charged to expense in the month in which the advertising materials are mailed since the benefit period for such costs is short and the amount of future benefit is not practically measurable. Marketing expenses for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 were $13,453 and $11,147 respectively.&nbsp;i. Equipment, Property and Leasehold Improvements&nbsp;Equipment, property and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:&nbsp;&nbsp;Software amortization amounted to $1 and $1 in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, respectively. Total depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $6,041 and $5,680 in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, respectively. Costs of normal maintenance and repairs and minor replacements are normally charged to expense as incurred. In those instances where we have determined we are contractually obligated to incur recurring repairs and maintenance costs related to our leased facilities, a provision is made in the financial statements at the earlier of the date the expense is incurred or the date of the obligation. The costs of assets sold or retired are eliminated from the accounts along with the related accumulated depreciation or amortization, and any resulting gain or loss is included in the statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2014, we sold and leased back for one year, with options for two six-month extensions, our corporate headquarters, located at 1831 Michael Faraday Dr., Reston, Virginia, which is a 38,500 square foot office facility that we currently use for our corporate headquarters, as well as the sales, administrative and operations groups of our United States subsidiary. The Company&#x2019;s carrying value of the headquarters property at the time of sale was approximately $3.6 million.The sale and the leaseback were accounted for as separate transactions based on their respective terms since the lease is determined to be minor.&nbsp; As such, we recognized a gain on the sale of $6.3 million which is shown on the other operating items line of our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).&nbsp;The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (&#x201c;ARO&#x201d;) associated with a leased facility is recorded as an asset (leasehold improvements) and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. See also Note 2 relating to AROs.&nbsp;j. Long-Lived Assets&nbsp;We periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, such as equipment, property and leasehold improvements for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In making such evaluations, we compare the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets. If the total of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the long-lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value of the assets and their book value. We make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain, such as estimating cash flows, remaining useful lives, discount rates and growth rates. The resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time, which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty. While we believe that our estimates are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuation of long-lived assets.&nbsp;k. Deferred Revenues&nbsp;Deferred revenues primarily relate to unearned revenues associated with Training Passports, Training Vouchers and advance payments received from customers for course events to be held in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;l. Comprehensive Income (loss)&nbsp;We report comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) represents changes in stockholders&#x2019; equity from non-owner sources and is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments. At the end of fiscal year 2014, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consisted of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments of $(325) compared to cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments of $(139) in fiscal year 2013.&nbsp;m. Income Taxes&nbsp;We provide for income taxes under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#x201c;FASB&#x201d;) ASC&nbsp;740,Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in our consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. Valuation allowances are provided against assets, including net operating losses, if it is anticipated that some or the entire asset may not be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies.&nbsp;The tax effects of uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a&nbsp;greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. It is our accounting policy to account for ASC 740-10 related penalties and interest&nbsp;as a component of the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).&nbsp;&nbsp;n. Foreign Currency&nbsp;We translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from the local (functional) currencies to U.S. dollars. The rates of exchange at each fiscal year end are used for translating the assets and liabilities and the average monthly rates of exchange for each year are used for the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses arising from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries&#x2019; financial statements are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of stockholders&#x2019; equity. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, we have not sought to hedge the risk associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and therefore we continue to be subject to such risk.&nbsp;o. Deferred Facilities Rent&nbsp;Operating Lease Activities:&nbsp;We lease education center and administrative office space under various operating lease agreements. Certain lease agreements include provisions that provide for cash incentives, graduated rent payments and other inducements. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the related terms of such leases. The value of lease incentives and/or inducements, along with the excess of the rent expense recognized over the rentals paid, is recorded as deferred facilities rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.&nbsp;Lease Termination Activities:&nbsp;We record liabilities for costs that will be incurred under a contract without economic benefit at estimated fair value. We have vacated space in leased facilities subject to operating leases and recorded the estimated liability associated with future rentals at the cease-use date. The fair value of the liability at the cease-use date was determined based on the remaining cash flows for lease rentals, and minimum lease payments, reduced by estimated sublease rentals and certain subtenant reimbursements that could be reasonably obtained for the property, discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. The liability is adjusted for changes, if any, resulting from revisions to estimated cash flows after the cease-use date, measured using the original historical credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Changes due to the passage of time are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as accretion expense.&nbsp;In September 2012, we announced our intention to close the Los Angeles, CA office facility effective December 2012. Our lease for these facilities runs through April 2016. We recorded a restructuring charge for the estimated liability associated with future rentals due under the property lease as of the cease use date. The fair value of the lease liability at the cease use date was determined based on the remaining cash flows for lease rentals, and minimum lease payments, reduced by estimated sublease rentals, discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate. In addition, the estimated useful life of leasehold improvements was adjusted for the December 2012 closure date. In June 2014, we re-evaluated the estimated sublease rentals as we have been unable to find a subtenant for the facility. As a result, we recorded an additional $0.5 million restructuring charge in our third quarter of fiscal year 2014.&nbsp;p. Fair Value of Financial Instruments&nbsp;The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;q. Use of Estimates&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.&nbsp;r. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2014, the FASB&nbsp;issued ASU&nbsp;No. 2014-09, &#x201c;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&#x201d;&nbsp;(&#x201c;ASU 2014-09&#x201d;). The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. Accordingly, the standard is effective for us on September 30, 2017 using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating which transition approach to use and the impact that the standard will have on our financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including the Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the SEC did not, or management believes will not, have a material impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;'

S'Nature of business:Electromed, Inc. (the "Company") develops, manufactures and markets innovative airway clearance products which apply High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation ("HFCWO") therapy in pulmonary care for patients of all ages. The Company markets its products in the United States to the home health care and institutional markets for use by patients in personal residences, hospitals and clinics. The Company also sells internationally both directly and through distributors. The Company had international sales of approximately $782,000and $547,000for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Since its inception, the Company has operated in a single industry segment: developing, manufacturing and marketing medical equipment.Principles of consolidation and related party transaction:The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Electromed, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Electromed Financial, LLC. Operating activities and net assets in Electromed Financial, LLC were insignificant as of and for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.Liquidity:For the year ended June 30, 2013 the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $1,329,000, primarily as a result of a decrease in domestic home care revenues. Cash provided by operating activities was $1,877,000 for the year ended June 30, 2013. The principal sources of liquidity in the future are expected to be cash flows from operations and availability on our line of credit. In order to operate profitably in the future, the Company must increase its revenue. The Company took actions, including workforce reductions, in seeking to achieve profitability and is prepared to take further actions as needed.The Company\'s ability to generate sufficient cash flows in fiscal 2014 could be negatively impacted by the business challenges in reimbursement from third party payers. There continues to be downward pressure on pricing and added administrative procedures implemented by third party payers in the insurance claims process which has lengthened the approval process compared to the prior year. Additionally, one of the largest domestic third party payers has decentralized its contracting process. As a result, the decentralization has required significantly more administrative efforts on the part of the Company to complete the necessary contracts to maintain our national coverage with that payer. Certain contracts have been resolved during the year, although the final completion of this process will extend into fiscal year 2014. The challenges the Company currently faces could result in future noncompliance with the covenants contained within the Company\'s credit facility. Any failure to comply with these covenants in the future may result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the lender accelerating the maturity of the Company\'s indebtedness or preventing access to additional funds under the credit facility, or requiring prepayment of outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility. If the maturity of the indebtedness is accelerated, or the company is unable to renew the line of credit, sufficient cash resources to satisfy the debt obligations may not be available and the Company may not be able to continue operations as planned. The indebtedness under the credit agreement is secured by a security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the Company. If the Company is unable to repay such indebtedness, the bank could foreclose on these assets.During fiscal year 2013, the Company has obtained waivers of noncompliance or entered into amendments with the lender to modify certain covenants. On July 8, 2013, the company entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement which removed all financial covenants as of June 30, 2013, and provided for adjustments to future financial and non-financial covenants. The company believes it will be able to maintain compliance with the future covenants set forth in the Sixth Amendment and negotiate an&nbsp;extension of the line of credit past its current expiration date of December 31, 2013, or obtain alternative financing.A summary of the Company\'s significant accounting policies follows:Use of estimates:Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were used. The Company believes the critical accounting policies that require the most significant assumptions and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition and the estimation of selling price adjustments, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, share-based compensation, income taxes and the warranty reserve.Revenue recognition:The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery of goods occurs through the transfer of title and risks and rewards of ownership, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues are primarily recognized upon shipment.Direct patient sales are recorded at amounts to be received from patients under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers, including private insurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the Company records an estimate for selling price adjustments which often arise from changes in a patient\'s insurance coverage, changes in a patient\'s domicile, insurance company coverage limitations or patient death. Other than the installment sales as discussed below, the Company expects to receive payment on the vast majority of accounts receivable within one year and therefore has classified all accounts receivable as current. However, in some instances, payment for direct patient sales can be delayed or interrupted, resulting in a portion of collections occurring later than one year.Certain third-party reimbursement agencies pay the Company on a monthly installment basis, which can span over several years. Due to the length of time over which cash is collected and the inherent uncertainty of collectability with these installment sales, the Company cannot make a reasonable estimate of revenue at the time of sale and does not record accounts receivable or revenue at the time of product shipment. Under the installment method, the Company defers the revenue associated with the sale and, as each installment is received, that amount is recognized as revenue. Deferred costs associated with the sale are amortized to cost of revenue ratably over the estimated period in which collections are scheduled to occur.A summary of sales made under the installment method are as follows:Unrecognized installment method sales were as follows:Shipping and handling expense:Shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company are included in cost of goods sold and were $259,000and $281,000for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Cash and cash equivalents:Cash equivalents consist of commercial paper with maturity dates of less than three months. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in these accounts.Accounts receivable:The Company\'s accounts receivable balance is comprised of amounts due from individuals, institutions and distributors. Balances due from individuals are typically remitted to the Company by third-party reimbursement agencies such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies. Accounts receivable are carried at amounts estimated to be received from patients under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers. Accounts receivable are also net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer\'s financial condition and credit history. Receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received. The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $45,000as of June 30, 2013 and 2012.Inventories:Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Work in process and finished goods are carried at standard cost, which approximates actual cost, and includes materials, labor and allocated overhead. Standard costs are reviewed at least quarterly by management, or more often in the event circumstances indicate a change in cost has occurred. The reserve for obsolescence is determined by analyzing the inventory on hand and comparing it to expected production requirements.Property and equipment:Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. The Company retains ownership of demonstration equipment in the possession of both inside and outside sales representatives, who use the equipment in the sales process.Finite-life intangible assets:Finite-life intangible assets include patents and trademarks. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, as described in Note 4.Long-lived assets:Long-lived assets, primarily property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. In evaluating recoverability, the following factors, among others, are considered: a significant change in the circumstances used to determine the amortization period, an adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a transition to a new product or service strategy, a significant change in customer base, and a realization of failed marketing efforts. The recoverability of an asset or asset group is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows.If the Company believes the carrying value is unrecoverable, it would recognize an impairment charge necessary to reduce the unamortized balance to the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. The amount of such impairment would be charged to operations in the current period. During the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company had no impairment associated with its long-lived assets.Warranty liability:For sales through June 30, 2013 we provide a lifetime warranty on products sold to patients in the United States and Canada, athree-year warranty for institutional sales within the United States and Canada, afive-year warranty on products sold to patients in Greece, and athree-year warranty on all other sales to individuals and institutions outside of the United States, Canada and Greece. For sales after June 30, 2013 we will provide a lifetime warranty on products sold to patients in the United States and a three year warranty on all other sales. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the product is shipped. Factors that affect the Company\'s warranty liability include the number of units shipped, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary.Changes in the Company\'s warranty liability were approximately as follows:Income taxes:Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.The Company recognizes tax liabilities when the Company believes that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Benefits from tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. Interest and penalties, if any, related to accrued liabilities for potential tax assessments are included in income tax expense.Research and development:Research and development costs include costs of research activities as well as engineering and technical efforts required to develop new products or make improvements to existing products. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.Advertising costs:Advertising costs are charged to expense when incurred. Advertising, marketing and trade show costs for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $628,000and $776,000, respectively.Share-based payments:Share-based payment awards consist of options issued to employees for services, and to non-employees in lieu of payment for services. Expense is estimated using the fair value of products or services rendered or the Black-Scholes pricing model at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service or vesting period of the award, or at the time services are provided for non-employee awards.Fair value of financial instruments:The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt is the remaining amount due to debtors under borrowing arrangements. To estimate the fair value of debt, the Company estimates the interest rate necessary to secure financing to replace its debt. At June 30, 2013, the fair value of long-term debt was not significantly different than its carrying value.Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share:Basic per share amounts is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted per share amounts assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock instruments unless their effect is anti-dilutive, thereby reducing the earnings or increasing the earnings per share. Common stock equivalents of&nbsp;599,900and&nbsp;636,200were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, as their impact was antidilutive (see Note 7 for information on stock options and warrants).Reclassifications:Certain items in the fiscal 2012 financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the classifications adopted for fiscal 2013. The fiscal 2012 reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income or equity.'

S'DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"StartFragment2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of Presentation- The accompanying financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Year-End- The Company had designated December 31 as its year end from November 5, 2005 (inception) through December 31, 2012. Effective January 14, 2013, the Company&#39;s Board of Directors elected to change its year end by adopting a fiscal year ending on the last day of February. The accompanying financial statements do not reflect the change in year end.Use of Estimates- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Cash- Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, and investment grade commercial paper that are readily convertible into cash and purchased with original maturities of three months or less.The Company maintains cash balances at an institution that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000.Accounts Receivable-The Company monitors its exposure to losses on accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for potential losses or adjustments. The Company reserves an amount based on the evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable, detailed analysis of high-risk customers&#39; accounts, and the overall market and economic conditions of our customers. Past due accounts receivable balances are written off when the Company&#39;s collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.Inventories- Inventories consisting of food, beverages, and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (FIFO) or market, including provisions for spoilage commensurate with known or estimated exposures which are recorded as a charge to cost of sales during the period spoilage is incurred. The Company did not incur significant charges to cost of sales for spoilage during the periods ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.Prepaid Expenses- Prepaid expenses include costs incurred for prepaid rents, insurance, non-inventory items, promotions and professional fees.Leasehold Improvements, Property and Equipment- Leasehold improvements, property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for property acquisitions, development, construction, improvements and major renewals are capitalized. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred. Depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term, which generally includes reasonably assured option periods, or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon sale or other disposition of a depreciable asset, cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected as a gain or loss from operations.The estimated useful lives are:U-Swirl caf&eacute;s currently under development are accounted for as construction-in-process. Construction-in-process is recorded at acquisition cost, including leasehold improvements, equipment expenditures, professional fees and interest expenses capitalized during the course of construction for the purpose of financing the project. Upon completion and readiness for use of the project, the cost of construction-in-process is transferred to an appropriate asset. Construction in process is valued at the lower of cost or market. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not have any construction-in-process.Deposits- Deposits consist of security deposits for multiple locations and a sales tax deposit held with the state of Nevada.Impairment of Long-lived Assets- The Company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements, property and equipment or whether the remaining balance of property and equipment should be evaluated for possible impairment. Based on its evaluation, the Company has determined that no impairment exists as of December 31, 2012.Revenue Recognition Policy- The Company recognizes revenue once pervasive evidence that an agreement exists; the product or service has been rendered; the fee is fixed and determinable; and collection of the amount due is reasonably assured.Revenue from U-Swirl caf&eacute; sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold. Caf&eacute; sales are reported net of sales discounts.Revenue earned as a U-Swirl Frozen Yogurt franchisor is derived from caf&eacute;s in the Company&#39;s worldwide territory and includes initial franchise fees and royalties.Initial franchise fee revenue from a the sale of a franchise is recognized when the Company has substantially performed or satisfied all of its material obligations relating to the sale up through the point at which the franchisee is able to open the franchised U-Swirl caf&eacute;, and the Company has no intention of refunding the entire initial franchise fee or forgiving an unpaid note for the entire initial franchise fee. Substantial performance has occurred when the Company has (a) performed substantially all of its initial services required by the franchise agreement, such as providing to the franchisee (1) a copy of the Operations Manual; (2) assistance in site selection and selection of suppliers of equipment, furnishings, and food; (3) lease review and comments about the lease; and (4) the initial training course to one or two franchisee representatives; and (b) completed all of its other material pre-opening obligations. The Company defers revenue from the initial franchise fee until (a) commencement of operations by the franchisee; or (b) if the franchisee does not open the franchised U-Swirl caf&eacute;, (1) the date on which all pre-opening services and obligations of the Company are substantially complete, or (2) an earlier date on which the franchisee has abandoned its efforts to proceed with the franchise operations, and in either situation, the franchisee is not entitled to, and is not given, a refund of the initial franchise fee. Royalties are recognized in the period in which they are earned.Rebates received from purveyors that supply products to our franchisees are included in franchise royalties and fees. Product rebates are recognized in the period in which they are earned. Rebates related to company-owned caf&eacute;s are offset against caf&eacute; operating costs.Rent- Rent expense for caf&eacute; leases, which provide for escalating rents over the terms of the leases, is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The lease terms began when the Company had the right to control the use of the property, which was before rent payments were actually due under the leases.The difference between the rent expense and the actual amount payable under the terms of the leases is recorded as a leasehold improvement asset and deferred rent liability on the Balance Sheet and as both an investing activity and a component of operating activities on the Statements of Cash Flows.Marketing and Advertising Expense- The Company recognizes marketing and advertising expense as incurred.Share-based Compensation Expense- The Company recognizes all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants, and restricted stock grants, at their fair value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.Share-based payments, excluding restricted stock, are valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.Share-based payment awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable.The grants are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period.When computing fair value of share-based compensation, the Company considers the following variables:Income Taxes- Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company&#39;s assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary.Assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. To the extent the Company believes it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against the Company&#39;s deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made.Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the statements of operations.Earnings (Loss) per Share- Basic earnings (loss) per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding common stock during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period.The computation of basic and diluted loss per share for the periods presented is equivalent since the Company had continuing losses. The Company had no common stock equivalents as of December 31, 2012.Fair Value of Financial Instruments- The Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") standard related to fair value measurement at inception. The standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and, accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The recorded values of long-term debt approximate their fair values, as interest approximates market rates. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the standard established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows.The Company&#39;s financial instruments consisted primarily of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying amounts of the Company&#39;s financial instruments generally approximated their fair values as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively due to the short-term nature of such items.New Accounting Pronouncements- There are no recent accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material effect on the Company&#39;s financial statements.EndFragment'

S'egxNOTE -2 &#150; BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES&nbsp;Basis of presentation&nbsp;The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our 51% owned subsidiary, Shandong Jiajia. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.&nbsp;Revenue Recognition&nbsp;We provide freight forwarding services generally under contract with our customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business model involves placing our customers&#146; freight on prearranged contracted transport.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 605, &#147;Revenue Recognition.&#148;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or product delivery has occurred, the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.&nbsp;Our revenue recognition is typically determined by our shipment/payment terms as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes direct shipping costs concurrently with the recognition of the related revenue for each shipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;These costs are generally isolated by billings as the Company does not own the shipping containers or transportation vessels.&nbsp;Use of Estimates&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods.&nbsp;Significant estimates for the periods reported include the allowance for doubtful accounts, which is based on an evaluation of our outstanding accounts receivable including the age of amounts due, the financial condition of our specific customers, knowledge of our industry segment in Asia, and historical bad debt experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;This evaluation methodology has provided a reasonable estimate of bad debt expense in the past and we intend to continue to employ this approach in our analysis of collectability.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are aware that given the varying recovery levels of our customers from the recent global economic situation meaningful time horizons may change.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also rely on certain assumptions when deriving the fair value of our derivative liability and calculations underlying our provision for taxes in China.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumptions and estimates employed in these areas can be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual results could differ from these estimates.&nbsp;Stock Based Compensation&nbsp;We account for equity-based compensation issued to employees by measuring the grant-date fair value of the securities issued to employees and recognize the associated compensation cost in the financial statements over the period during which the employees are required to provide services.&nbsp;Basic and Diluted Earnings per share&nbsp;Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 260-10-45, basic income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance&nbsp;of common stock that would then share in the income of the company, subject to anti-dilution limitations.&nbsp;Cash and Cash Equivalents&nbsp;The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these instruments approximates fair value.&nbsp;Concentration of Credit Risk&nbsp;Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. We deposit our cash with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States and China (the &#147;PRC&#148;). At December 31, 2011, we had deposits of $1,374,640 in banks in the PRC.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the PRC, there is no federal deposit insurance as in the United States; as such these amounts held in banks in the PRC are not insured. We have not experienced any losses in such bank accounts through December 31, 2011.&nbsp;Accounts Receivable&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for the estimated uncollectible portion of its accounts receivable. This estimate is based on the historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade receivables. There is no set threshold amount or age for accounts receivable write-offs; any decision is made by management on an account-by-account basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for doubtful accounts totaled $2,884,655 and $1,930,552 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.&nbsp;Advances to Vendors and Other Prepaid Expenses&nbsp;Advances to vendors and other prepaid expenses consist primarily of prepayments or deposits from us for contracted shipping arrangements that have not been utilized by our customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;These amounts are recognized as cost of revenues as shipments are completed and customers utilize the shipping arrangement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Advances to vendors totaled $24,356 and $347,409 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.&nbsp;Property and Equipment and Long-Lived assets&nbsp;Property and equipment are recorded at cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Depreciation of property and equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective estimated residual values) over the assets estimated useful lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leasehold improvements, if any, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease period or the estimated useful life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in the business, generally in conjunction with the annual business planning cycle, and when events and circumstances otherwise warrant. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value for assets to be held and used. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.&nbsp;Advances from Customers&nbsp;Advances from customers consist of prepayments to us for contracted cargo that has not yet been shipped to the recipient and for other advance deposits. These amounts are recognized as revenue as shipments are completed and customers take delivery of goods, in compliance with the related contract and our revenue recognition policy. Advances from customers totaled $485,102 and $466,056, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Currency Translation&nbsp;The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The functional currency of Shandong Jiajia is the Renminbi (&#147;RMB&#148;), the official currency of the PRC.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assets and liabilities are translated from the local currency into the reporting currency, U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period to approximate translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates those elements are recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Gains and losses resulting from the translation of local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of stockholders&#146; equity and comprehensive income (loss).&nbsp;RMB is not a fully convertible currency. All foreign exchange transactions involving RMB must take place through PRC authorized institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation of amounts from RMB into United States dollars (&#147;US$&#148;) has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-controlling Interest&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-controlling interests in our subsidiary are recorded as a component of our equity, separate from the parent&#146;s equity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchase or sale of equity interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Results of operations attributable to the non-controlling interest are included in our consolidated results of operations and upon loss of control the interest sold, as well as the interest retained, if any, will be reported at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.&nbsp;Income Taxes&nbsp;&nbsp;We follow the asset and liability method of accounting for taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. If it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized.&nbsp;Recent Accounting Pronouncements&nbsp;&nbsp;In September, 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&quot;ASU&quot;) No. 2011-08, Intangibles &#150; Goodwill and Other, which simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment. This ASU would allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under the ASU, an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The ASU includes a number of factors to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASU is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;Early adoption is permitted. This standard does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05,Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.Under the amendments, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The presentation option under current U.S. GAAP to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders&#146; equity has been eliminated. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively. For public entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted because compliance with amendments is already permitted. We already comply with this presentation.&nbsp;A variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and various regulatory agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the tentative and preliminary nature of those proposed standards, the Company&#146;s management has not determined whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material to its consolidated financial statements.'

S'DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"Begin Block Tagged Note 2 - us-gaap:SignificantAccountingPoliciesTextBlockPrinciples of Consolidation    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Glatfelter and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Accounting Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingencies as of the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are reasonable, based upon currently available facts and known circumstances, but recognizes that actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.Cash and Cash Equivalents    We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase as cash equivalents.Inventories    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Raw materials, in-process and finished inventories of our U.S. manufacturing operations are valued using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, and the supplies inventories are valued principally using the average-cost method. Inventories at our foreign operations are valued using the average cost method.Plant, Equipment and Timberlands    For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The range of estimated service lives used to calculate financial reporting depreciation for principal items of plant and equipment are as follows: Maintenance and Repairs    Maintenance and repairs costs are charged to income and major renewals and betterments are capitalized. At the time property is retired or sold, the net carrying value is eliminated and any resultant gain or loss is included in income.Valuation of Long-lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill    We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment when a specific event indicates that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed based on estimates of future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the asset&#8217;s fair value is estimated and an impairment loss is recognized for any deficiencies. Goodwill is reviewed, on a discounted cash flow basis, during the third quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Impairment losses, if any, are recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The carrying value of a reporting unit is defined using an enterprise premise which is generally determined by the difference between the unit&#8217;s assets and operating liabilities.Asset Retirement Obligations    In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) No. 410,Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations,we accrue asset retirement obligations in the period in which obligations relating to future asset retirements are incurred and when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be determined. Under these standards, costs are to be accrued at estimated fair value, and a related long-lived asset is capitalized. Over time, the liability is accreted to its settlement value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset for which the obligation exists. Upon settlement of the liability, we recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the settlement amount and the liability recorded. Income Taxes    Income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740Income Taxes(&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). Under ASC 740, tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. Tax credits and other incentives reduce tax expense in the year the credits are claimed. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported in deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years. We establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not more likely than not.Income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10-20Income Taxes. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. We and our subsidiaries are examined by various Federal, State, and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and record any necessary adjustments in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.Treasury Stock    Common stock purchased for treasury is recorded at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on the weighted-average cost basis.Foreign Currency Translation    Foreign currency translation gains and losses and the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions designated as hedges of net foreign investments are included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are included in income in the period in which they occur.Revenue Recognition    We recognize revenue on product sales when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Estimated costs for sales incentives, discounts and sales returns and allowances are recorded as sales deductions in the period in which the related revenue is recognized.Revenue from energy sales is recognized when electricity is delivered to the customer. Certain costs associated with the production of electricity, such as fuel, labor, depreciation and maintenance are netted against energy sales for presentation on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Our fixed-price contract to sell electricity generated in excess of our own use expired March 31, 2010. Subsequent to the expiration, we now sell excess power at market-rates.Revenue from renewable energy credits is recorded under the caption &#8220;Energy and related sales&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is recognized when all risks, rights and rewards to the certificate are transferred to the counterparty.Environmental Liabilities    Accruals for losses associated with environmental obligations are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing legislation and remediation technologies. Costs related to environmental remediation are charged to expense. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment and remediation actions continue and/or further legal or technical information develops. Such undiscounted liabilities are exclusive of any insurance or other claims against third parties. Environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life of the asset, increase its capacity and/or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties, including insurance carriers, are recorded as assets when their receipt is assured beyond a reasonable doubt.Earnings Per Share    Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the respective periods. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of common share equivalents is considered in the diluted earnings per share computation using the treasury stock method.Financial Derivatives and Hedging Activities     We use financial derivatives to manage exposure to changes in foreign currencies. In accordance with FASBASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging(&#8220;ASC 815&#8221;), we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Cash Flow Hedges    The effective portion of the gain or loss on those derivative instruments designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to forecasted transactions is deferred and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Deferred gains or losses are reclassified to our results of operations at the time the hedged forecasted transaction is recorded in our results of operations. The effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed at inception and quarterly thereafter. If the instrument becomes ineffective or it becomes probable that the originally   forecasted transaction will not occur, the related change in fair value of the derivative instrument is also reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings.Fair Value of Financial Instruments    Under the accounting for fair value measurements and disclosures, a fair value hierarchy was established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). A financial instrument&#8217;s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:  Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2011-05,&#8220;Presentation of Comprehensive Income.&#8221;This ASU is designed to improve the comparability and transparency of other comprehensive income components. The guidance provides an option to present total comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements. This ASU eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income components as part of the statement of changes in shareholders&#8217; equity. We have adopted this standard by presenting a separate consecutive statement of comprehensive income.In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02  &#8221;Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income&#8221; which will require new disclosures about items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The new standard is required to be adopted in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012. This standard is not expected to have a material impact on us.In September 2011, the FASB updated FASB ASC 350,Intangibles   Goodwill and Otherto provide an entity the option, when evaluating goodwill and other assets for possible impairment, to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after completing this assessment, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. We adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2012 and it did not have a material impact on us. This update became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012.'

S'DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"Begin Block Tagged Note 2 - us-gaap:SignificantAccountingPoliciesTextBlock  Principles of Consolidation.  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Variable Interest Entities.  In 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) amended the consolidation principles associated with variable interest entities (&#8220;VIE&#8221;). The new accounting guidance caused a change in our accounting policy effective January 3, 2010. Generally, the new qualitative approach replaced the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise, if any, has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. The qualitative approach is focused on identifying which company has both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity&#8217;s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. As a result of applying this qualitative analysis, effective January 3, 2010, the company is no longer required to consolidate the VIE that delivers a significant portion of its fresh bakery products from the company&#8217;s production facilities to outlying distribution centers under a transportation agreement. The company has elected to prospectively deconsolidate the VIE. Please see Note 14,Variable Interest Entity, for additional disclosure. Fiscal Year End.  The company operates on a52-53 weekfiscal year ending the Saturday nearest December 31. Fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2008 consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal 2011 will consist of 52 weeks. Revenue Recognition.  The company recognizes revenue from the sale of product at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive. Independent distributors receive a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to retailers and other customers. The company records such amounts as selling, distribution and administrative expenses. Independent distributors do not pay royalty or royalty-related fees to the company. The consumer packaged goods industry has used scan-based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer. An extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer. Consequently, revenue on these sales is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer. This technology is referred to aspay-by-scan(&#8220;PBS&#8221;). In fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 the company recorded $744.7 million, $674.9 million and $651.5 million, respectively, in sales through PBS. Revenue on PBS sales is recognized when the product is purchased by the end consumer because that is when title and risk of loss is transferred. Non-PBS sales are recognized when the product is delivered to the customer (i.e. the independent distributor or retail customers) since that is when title and risk of loss is transferred. The company&#8217;s production facilities deliver the products to independent distributors, who deliver the product to outlets of retail accounts that are within the distributors&#8217; geographic territory. PBS is utilized primarily in certain national and regional retail accounts (&#8220;PBS Outlet&#8221;). No revenue is recognized by the company upon delivery of the product by the company to the distributor or upon delivery of the product by the distributor to a PBS Outlet. It is recognized when the product is purchased by the end consumer. The product inventory in the PBS Outlet is reflected as inventory on the company&#8217;s balance sheet. The balance of PBS inventory at January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010 was $4.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively. A distributor performs a physical inventory of the product at each PBS Outlet weekly and reports the results to the company. The inventory data submitted by the distributor for each PBS Outlet is compared with the product delivery data. Product delivered to a PBS Outlet that is not recorded in the inventory data has been purchased by the consumer/customer of the PBS Outlet and is recorded as sales revenue by the company. The PBS Outlet submits the scan data that records the purchase by the consumer/customer to the company either daily or weekly. The company reconciles the scan data with the physical inventory data. A difference in the data indicates that &#8220;shrink&#8221; has occurred. Shrink is product unaccounted for by scan data or PBS Outlet inventory counts. A reduction of revenue and a balance sheet reserve is recorded at each reporting period for the estimated costs of shrink. The amount of shrink experienced by the company was immaterial in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. The company purchases territories from and sells territories to independent distributors from time to time. At the time the company purchases a territory from an independent distributor, the fair value purchase price of the territory is recorded as &#8220;Assets Held for Sale &#8212; Distributor Routes&#8221;. Upon the sale of that territory to a new independent distributor, generally a note receivable is recorded for the sales price of the territory (for those situations when the company provides direct financing to the distributor) with a corresponding credit to assets held for sale to relieve the carrying amount of the territory. Any difference between the amount of the note receivable and the territory&#8217;s carrying value is recorded as a gain or a loss in selling, distribution and administrative expenses because the company considers its distributor activity a cost of distribution. No revenue is recorded when the company sells a territory to an independent distributor. The deferred gains were $16.9 million and $19.3 million at January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, respectively. In the event the sales price of the territory exceeds the carrying amount of the territory, the gain is deferred and recorded over the10-yearlife of the note receivable from the independent distributor. In addition, since the distributor has the right to require the company to repurchase the territory at the original purchase price within the six-month period following the date of sale, no gain is recorded on the sale of the territory during this six-month period. Upon expiration of the six-month period, the amount deferred during this period is recorded and the remaining gain on the sale is recorded over the remaining nine and one-half years of the note. In instances where a territory is sold for less than its carrying value, a loss is recorded at the date of sale and any impairment of a territory held for sale is recorded at such time the impairment occurs. The company recorded net gains of $4.2 million during fiscal 2010, $3.9 million during fiscal 2009 and $2.1 million during fiscal 2008 related to the sale of territories as a component of selling, distribution and administrative expenses. Cash and Cash Equivalents.  The company considers deposits in banks, certificates of deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable.  Accounts receivable consists of trade receivables, current portions of distributor notes receivable and miscellaneous receivables. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Bad debts are charged to this reserve after all attempts to collect the balance are exhausted. If the financial condition of the company&#8217;s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In determining past due or delinquent status of a customer, the aged trial balance is reviewed on a weekly basis by sales management and generally any accounts older than seven weeks are considered delinquent. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows (amounts in thousands):  Concentration of Credit Risk.  The company performs periodic credit evaluations and grants credit to customers, who are primarily in the grocery and foodservice markets, and generally does not require collateral. Our top 10 customers in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 accounted for 46.5%, 46.0% and 45.6% of sales, respectively. Following is the effect our largest customer, Wal-Mart/Sam&#8217;s Club, had on the company&#8217;s sales for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008.  Inventories.  Inventories at January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010 are valued at the lower of cost or market using thefirst-in-first-outmethod. The company writes down its inventory for estimated unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Shipping Costs.  Shipping costs are included in the selling, distribution and administrative line item of the consolidated statements of income. For fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, shipping costs were $577.3 million, $578.0 million, and $548.4 million, respectively, including distributor discounts. Spare Parts and Supplies.  The company maintains inventories of spare parts and supplies, which are used for repairs and maintenance of its machinery and equipment. These spare parts and supplies allow the company to react quickly in the event of a mechanical breakdown. These parts are valued using thefirst-in-first-outmethod and are expensed as the part is used. Periodic physical inventories of the parts are performed, and the value of the parts is adjusted for any obsolescence or difference in the actual inventory count and the value recorded. Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation.  Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. Certain equipment held under capital leases of $13.4 million and $41.3 million at January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, respectively, is classified as property, plant and equipment and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities. Amortization of assets held under capital leases is included in depreciation expense. Total accumulated depreciation for assets held under capital leases was $3.3 million and $15.3 million at January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, respectively. The significant decrease in gross equipment held under capital leases is due to the deconsolidation of the variable interest entity as discussed in Note 14,Variable Interest Entity. Buildings are depreciated over ten to forty years, machinery and equipment over three to twenty-five years, and furniture, fixtures and transportation equipment over three to fifteen years. Property under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the property. Depreciation expense for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $79.1 million, $75.1 million and $70.3 million, respectively. The company recorded capitalized interest of $0.2 million during fiscal 2009 and $0.2 million during fiscal 2008. The company recorded an immaterial amount of capitalized interest during fiscal 2010.XBRL Pagebreak BeginEND PAGE WIDTHPAGEBREAKBEGIN PAGE WIDTHXBRL Pagebreak End The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal or retirement, the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets are eliminated from the respective accounts. Any gain or loss is reflected in the company&#8217;s income from operations. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  The company accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. The company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value) using a two-step method. The company conducts this review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year absent any triggering event. No impairment resulted from the annual review performed in fiscal years 2010, 2009 or 2008. Identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment, at least annually, using a one-step fair value based approach or when certain indicators of impairment are present. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.  The company determines whether there has been an impairment of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have indefinite useful economic lives, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset&#8217;s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market value is required. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying long-lived assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets that may not be reflected in the assets&#8217; current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. During fiscal 2008, the company had an impairment charge of $3.1 million as discussed in Note 5,Asset Impairment. There were no impairment charges during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. Derivative Financial Instruments.  The company enters into commodity derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges of existing or future exposure to changes in commodity prices. The company&#8217;s primary raw materials are flour, sweeteners and shortening, along with pulp, paper, and petroleum-based packaging products. The company uses natural gas and propane as fuel for firing ovens. The company also periodically enters into interest rate derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates. See Note 10,Derivative Financial Instruments, for further details. Treasury Stock.  The company records acquisitions of its common stock for treasury at cost. Differences between proceeds for reissuances of treasury stock and average cost are credited or charged to capital in excess of par value to the extent of prior credits and thereafter to retained earnings. Advertising and Marketing Costs.  Advertising and marketing costs are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising and marketing costs were $14.4 million, $11.3 million and $12.6 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation.  Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value. The company recognizes these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate, and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the share-based payment award. Software Development Costs.  The company expenses software development costs incurred in the preliminary project stage, and, thereafter, capitalizes costs incurred in developing or obtaining internally used software. Certain costs, such as maintenance and training, are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs are amortized over a period of three to eight years and are subject to impairment evaluation. The net balance of capitalized software development costs included in plant, property and equipment was $6.2 million and $2.5 million at January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, respectively. Amortization expense of capitalized software development costs, which is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of income, was $1.7 million, $1.1 million and $2.8 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income Taxes.  The company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method that recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. The company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recorded within the interest expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Self-Insurance Reserves.  The company is self-insured for various levels of general liability, auto liability, workers&#8217; compensation and employee medical and dental coverage. Insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends. Projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims, historical trends and data. Though the company does not expect them to do so, actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated. Material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Net Income Per Common Share.  Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding for the period. Common stock equivalents consist of the incremental shares associated with the company&#8217;s stock compensation plans, as determined under the treasury stock method. Our nonvested performance contingent restricted stock awards granted prior to the February 9, 2010 grant are considered participating securities since the share-based awards contain a non-forfeitable right to dividend equivalents irrespective of whether the awards ultimately vest. As a result, we computed basic earnings per common share under the two-class method for those awards. The performance contingent restricted stock awards granted on February 9, 2010 do not contain a non-forfeitable right to dividend equivalents and are included in the computation for diluted net income per share. A grant issued on February 10, 2011 also does not contain a non-forfeitable right to dividend equivalents and will be included in the computation for diluted net income per share. Use of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.'

S'NOTE A   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Business:Universal Security Instruments, Inc.&#8217;s (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) primary business is the sale of smoke alarms and other safety products to retailers, wholesale distributors and to the electrical distribution trade which includes electrical and lighting distributors as well as manufactured housing companies. The Company imports all of its safety and other products from foreign manufacturers. The Company, as an importer, is subject to numerous tariffs which vary depending on types of products and country of origin, changes in economic and political conditions in the country of manufacture, potential trade restrictions and currency fluctuations. Principles of Consolidation:The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We believe that our 50% ownership interest in the Hong Kong Joint Venture allows us to significantly influence the operations of the Hong Kong Joint Venture. As such, we account for our interest in the Hong Kong Joint Venture using the equity method of accounting. We have included our investment balance as a non-current asset and have included our share of the Hong Kong Joint Venture&#8217;s income in our consolidated statement of operations. The investment and earnings are adjusted to eliminate intercompany profits. Use of Estimates:In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP), management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.At times, the Company maintains cash and investment balances in financial institutions, which may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses relating to such accounts and believes it is not exposed to a significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents and investments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their fair value based on their short-term maturities at March 31, 2013 and 2012. Revenue Recognition:The Company recognizes sales upon shipment of products, when title has passed to the buyer, net of applicable provisions for any discounts or allowances. We recognize revenue when the following criterion are met: evidence of an arrangement, fixed and determinable fee, delivery has taken place, and collectability is reasonably assured. Customers may not return, exchange or refuse acceptance of goods without our approval. We have established allowances to cover anticipated doubtful accounts based upon historical experience. Warranties:We generally provide warranties, on the safety products, from one to ten years to the non-commercial end user on all products sold. The manufacturers of our safety products provide us with a one-year warranty on all products we purchase for resale. Claims for warranty replacement of products beyond the one-year warranty period covered by the manufacturers have not been historically material and we do not record estimated warranty expense or a contingent liability for warranty claims. Stock-Based Compensation:In October 2011, the stockholders approved the Company&#8217;s 2011 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan authorizing the issuance of 120,000 options to purchase the Company&#8217;s common stock. As of March 31, 2013, 97,000 options have been issued at an exercise price of $5.51 with a right to exercise until December 2013. We account for share-based payments using the fair value method. We recognize all share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors in our financial statements based on their grant date fair values, calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation expense related to share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the value of share awards that are expected to vest during the requisite service period on the grant date, which is revised if actual forfeitures differ materially from original expectations. The expected term of stock options granted was based on the Company&#8217;s historical option exercise experience and post-vesting forfeiture experience using the historical expected term from the vesting date. The expected volatility of the options granted was determined using historical volatilities based on stock prices over a look-back period corresponding to the expected term. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the yield available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the options. The forfeiture rate was determined using historical pre-vesting forfeiture rates since the inception of the plans. The company has never paid a dividend; and, as such, the dividend yield is zero. Stock Repurchase Program: In October 2011, the Company announced a stock buyback program under which the Board authorized the purchase of up to 100,000 shares of common stock. The program terminated in February 2013 when the purchase of 100,000 shares of common stock was completed by the Company pursuant to the program. The following table sets forth information with respect to purchases by the Company of its common stock during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013:  Research and Development:Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Accounts Receivable:The Company nets the factored accounts receivable with the corresponding advance from the Factor, with the net amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company assigns trade receivables on a pre-approved non-recourse basis to the Factor under the Factoring Agreement on an ongoing basis. Factoring charges recognized on assignment of receivables are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and amounted to $78,467 and $56,943 for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Agreement for the assignment of accounts receivable provides for continuation of the program on a revolving basis until terminated by one of the parties to the Agreement. Financing Receivables.In September 2010, the FASB issued, and the Company adopted, an Accounting Standards Update requiring enhanced disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables, as defined therein, and the adequacy of allowances for credit losses. Management considers amounts due from the Company&#8217;s factor to be &#8220;financing receivables&#8221;. Trade accounts receivable, other receivables, and receivables from our Hong Kong Joint Venture are not considered to be financing receivables. The Company assigns the majority of its short-term receivables arising in the ordinary course of business to our factor. At the time a receivable is sold to our factor the credit risk associated with the credit worthiness of the debtor is assumed by the factor. The Company continues to bear any credit risk associated with delivery or warranty issues related to the products sold. Management assesses the credit risk of both its trade accounts receivable and its financing receivables based on the specific identification of accounts that have exceeded credit terms. An allowance for uncollectible receivables is provided based on that assessment. Changes in the allowance account from one accounting period to the next are charged to operations in the period the change is determined. Amounts ultimately determined to be uncollectible are eliminated from the receivable accounts and from the allowance account in the period that the receivables&#8217; status is determined to be uncollectible. Based on the nature of the factoring agreement and prior experience, no allowance for uncollectible financing receivables has been provided. At March 31, 2013, an allowance of $57,000 has been provided for uncollectible trade accounts receivable. Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs:The Company includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers in net sales. Shipping and handling costs associated with inbound freight are included in cost of goods sold. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and totaled $309,533 and $356,171 in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. Inventories:Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in/first out method) or market. Included as a component of finished goods inventory are additional non-material costs. These costs include overhead costs, freight, import duty and inspection fees of $509,808 and $571,219 at March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Inventories are shown net of an allowance for inventory obsolescence of $70,000 as of March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company reviews inventory quarterly to identify slow moving products and valuation allowances are adjusted when deemed necessary. Income Taxes:The Company recognizes a liability or asset for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. These temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. The deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided, whenever it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company established a valuation allowance of $300,000 on its deferred tax asset during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 to recognize that certain foreign tax credits expiring over the next two fiscal years will likely not be realized. Our ability to realize our remaining deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible temporary differences and tax planning strategies. If such estimates and assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations. At this time, we believe that the earnings performance of our business will continue during the periods in which the applicable temporary income tax differences become deductible. Accordingly, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets. The Company follows the financial pronouncement that gives guidance related to the financial statement of recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recorded as income tax expenses,See Note F,Income Taxes. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:Changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US. GAAP) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standards updated (ASU&#8217;s) to the FASB&#8217;s Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASU&#8217;s. Recently issued ASU&#8217;s were evaluated and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency: The activity and accounts of the Hong Kong Joint Venture are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and are translated to US dollars in consolidation. The Company translates the accounts of the Hong Kong Joint Venture at the applicable exchange rate in effect at the year end date for balance sheet purposes and at the average exchange rate for the reporting period for statement of operation purposes. Transaction gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in the results of operations. The Company currently does not maintain cash in foreign banks to support its operations in Hong Kong. Net Income per Share:The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding (unless their effect is anti-dilutive) for the period. All common share equivalents are comprised of stock options. Diluted loss per common share for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 exclude the effect of all stock options, which amounted to $122,000 at both March 31, 2013 and 2012, as their effect is antidilutive. As a result, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is identical for the years ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 for both basic and diluted shares.'

S'2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesPrinciples of Consolidation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in prior periods may have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The effects of the reclassifications were not material to the consolidated financial statements.Use of Estimates&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosures regarding contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates used in our financial statements affect revenue and cost recognition for construction contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, self-insurance accruals, deferred tax assets, warranty accruals, fair value accounting for acquisitions and the quantification of fair value for reporting units in connection with our goodwill impairment testing. In 2015, two operating locations came to an agreement with customers on multiple jobs and received approved change orders, which resulted in the recognition of additional revenue with minimal additional costs resulting in a project gain of $3.4&nbsp;million, on a pre-tax basis. In the twelve months ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, one of our operating locations recorded a revision in contract estimate on a project in a loss position resulting in a writedown to this individual project of $4.4 million, on a pre-tax basis.Cash Flow Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash paid (in thousands) for:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent Accounting Pronouncements&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." ASU 2014-09 provides a framework that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance. The guidance can be applied on a full retrospective or modified retrospective basis whereby the entity records a cumulative effect of initially applying this update at the date of initial application. We currently plan to use the modified retrospective basis on the adoption date. It is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issue Costs." Under ASU 2015-03, an entity presents debt issue costs related to a note in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Entities would apply the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-15, "Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements." The amendment clarifies ASU 2015-03 and provides that an entity may defer and present debt issuance costs for a line-of-credit or other revolving credit facility arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. As such, we will continue to include debt issuance costs for our revolving credit facility arrangements in other noncurrent assets. These ASUs are effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period. We early adopted these ASUs on December&nbsp;31, 2015, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-11, "Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory", which requires that inventory within the scope of the guidance be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonable predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Inventory measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) and the retail inventory method (RIM) are not impacted by the new guidance. Entities should apply the new guidance prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on our consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments", which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We early adopted this ASU in the third quarter of 2015 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.&nbsp;2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes" ("ASU 2015-17"). The standard requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than being separated into current and noncurrent. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax assets and liabilities. We early adopted ASU 2015-17 in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis. Accordingly, we reclassified $19.4&nbsp;million of current deferred tax assets and $0.3&nbsp;million of current deferred tax liabilities to noncurrent as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.Revenue Recognition&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 82% of our revenue was earned on a project basis and recognized through the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, contract revenue recognizable at any time during the life of a contract is determined by multiplying expected total contract revenue by the percentage of contract costs incurred at any time to total estimated contract costs. More specifically, as part of the negotiation and bidding process in connection with obtaining installation contracts, we estimate our contract costs, which include all direct materials (exclusive of rebates), labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. These contract costs are included in our results of operations under the caption "Cost of Services." Then, as we perform under those contracts, we measure costs incurred, compare them to total estimated costs to complete the contract and recognize a corresponding proportion of contract revenue. Labor costs are considered to be incurred as the work is performed. Subcontractor labor is recognized as the work is performed, but is generally subjected to approval as to milestones or other evidence of completion. Non-labor project costs consist of purchased equipment, prefabricated materials and other materials. Purchased equipment on our projects is substantially produced to job specifications and is a value added element to our work. The costs are considered to be incurred when title is transferred to us, which typically is upon delivery to the work site. Prefabricated materials, such as ductwork and piping, are generally performed at our shops and recognized as contract costs when fabricated for the unique specifications of the job. Other materials costs are not significant and are generally recorded when delivered to the work site. This measurement and comparison process requires updates to the estimate of total costs to complete the contract, and these updates may include subjective assessments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We generally do not incur significant costs prior to receiving a contract, and therefore, these costs are expensed as incurred. In limited circumstances, when significant pre-contract costs are incurred, they are deferred if the costs can be directly associated with a specific contract and if their recoverability from the contract is probable. Upon receiving the contract, these costs are included in contract costs. Deferred costs associated with unsuccessful contract bids are written off in the period that we are informed that we will not be awarded the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project contracts typically provide for a schedule of billings or invoices to the customer based on reaching agreed upon milestones or as we incur costs. The schedules for such billings usually do not precisely match the schedule on which costs are incurred. As a result, contract revenue recognized in the statement of operations can and usually does differ from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any point during the contract. Amounts by which cumulative contract revenue recognized on a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative billings to the customer under the contract are reflected as a current asset in our balance sheet under the caption "Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings." Amounts by which cumulative billings to the customer under a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative contract revenue recognized on the contract are reflected as a current liability in our balance sheet under the caption "Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contracts in progress are as follows (in thousands):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts receivable include amounts billed to customers under retention or retainage provisions in construction contracts. Such provisions are standard in our industry and usually allow for a small portion of progress billings or the contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed work on the project, typically for a period of six months. Based on our experience with similar contracts in recent years, the majority of our billings for such retention balances at each balance sheet date are finalized and collected within the subsequent year. Retention balances at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 were $51.6&nbsp;million and $50.5&nbsp;million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts payable at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 included $7.8&nbsp;million and $8.9&nbsp;million of retainage under terms of contracts with subcontractors, respectively. The majority of the retention balances at each balance sheet date are finalized and paid within the subsequent year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The percentage of completion method of accounting is also affected by changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements. These factors may result in revisions to estimated costs and, therefore, revenue. Such revisions are frequently based on further estimates and subjective assessments. The effects of these revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. When such revisions lead to a conclusion that a loss will be recognized on a contract, the full amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the period such a conclusion is reached, regardless of the percentage of completion of the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revisions to project costs and conditions can give rise to change orders under which the customer agrees to pay additional contract price. Revisions can also result in claims we might make against the customer to recover project variances that have not been satisfactorily addressed through change orders with the customer. Except in certain circumstances, we do not recognize revenue or margin based on change orders or claims until they have been agreed upon with the customer. The amount of revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims was immaterial for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results, depending on project size, and the recoverability of the variation via additional customer payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue associated with maintenance, repair and monitoring services and related contracts are recognized as services are performed. Amounts associated with unbilled service work orders are reflected as a current asset in our balance sheet under the caption "Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings" and amounts billed in advance of work orders being performed are reflected as a current liability in our balance sheet under the caption "Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings."Accounts Receivable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying value of our receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents the estimated net realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the creditworthiness of our customers, prior collection history, ongoing relationships with our customers, the aging of past due balances, our lien rights, if any, in the property where we performed the work and the availability, if any, of payment bonds applicable to the contract. The receivables are written off when they are deemed to be uncollectible.Inventories&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories consist of parts and supplies that we purchase and hold for use in the ordinary course of business and are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average-cost method.Property and Equipment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the expected life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the equipment. Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in "Gain on sale of assets" in the statement of operations.Recoverability of Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We assess goodwill for impairment each year, and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carrying value of a given reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If other reporting units have had increases in fair value, such increases may not be recorded. Accordingly, such increases may not be netted against impairments at other reporting units. The requirements for assessing whether goodwill has been impaired involve market-based information. This information, and its use in assessing goodwill, entails some degree of subjective assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We perform our annual impairment testing as of October&nbsp;1 and any impairment charges resulting from this process are reported in the fourth quarter. We segregate our operations into reporting units based on the degree of operating and financial independence of each unit and our related management of them. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level. Each of our operating units represents an operating segment, and our operating segments are our reporting units.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of our reporting units is greater than its carrying value. If, after completing such assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then there is no need to perform any further testing. If we conclude otherwise, then we perform the first step of a two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying value of the reporting unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on two market approaches and an income approach, which utilizes discounted future cash flows. Assumptions critical to the fair value estimates under the discounted cash flow model include discount rates, cash flow projections, projected long-term growth rates and the determination of terminal values. The market approaches utilized market multiples of invested capital from comparable publicly traded companies ("public company approach") and comparable transactions ("transaction approach"). The market multiples from invested capital include revenue, book equity plus debt and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA").&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We amortize identifiable intangible assets with finite lives over their useful lives. Changes in strategy and/or market condition may result in adjustments to recorded intangible asset balances.Long-Lived Assets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-lived assets are comprised principally of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, property and equipment, and deferred income tax assets. We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining balances of these assets may not be recoverable. We use estimates of future income from operations and cash flows, as well as other economic and business factors, to assess the recoverability of these assets.Acquisitions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including contingent assets and liabilities, based on fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contingent Consideration&#x2014;In certain acquisitions, we agree to pay additional amounts to sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of certain predetermined profitability targets. We have recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition with any differences between the acquisition date fair value and the ultimate settlement of the obligations being recognized in income from operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contingent Assets and Liabilities&#x2014;Assets and liabilities arising from contingencies are recognized at their acquisition date fair value when their respective fair values can be determined. If the fair values of such contingencies cannot be determined, they are recognized at the acquisition date if the contingencies are probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Acquisition date fair value estimates are revised as necessary if, and when, additional information regarding these contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed.Self-Insurance Liabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are substantially self-insured for workers\' compensation, employer\'s liability, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims, in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Losses up to deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts, historical trends and industry averages. Loss estimates associated with the larger and longer-developing risks&#x2014;workers\' compensation, auto liability and general liability&#x2014;are reviewed by a third-party actuary quarterly. Our self-insurance arrangements are further discussed in Note&nbsp;12 "Commitments and Contingencies."Warranty Costs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We typically warrant labor for the first year after installation on new HVAC systems. We generally warrant labor for thirty days after servicing of existing HVAC systems. A reserve for warranty costs is estimated and recorded based upon the historical level of warranty claims and management\'s estimate of future costs.Income Taxes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to income tax in the United States and Puerto Rico and file&nbsp;a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes. Income taxes are provided for under the liability method, which takes into account differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carryforwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. We perform this evaluation quarterly. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, taxable income in prior carryback years and tax planning strategies in making this assessment, and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions may be disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and are classified as a component of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.Segment Disclosure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our activities are within the mechanical services industry, which is the single industry segment we serve. Each operating unit represents an operating segment and these segments have been aggregated, as the operating units meet all of the aggregation criteria.Concentrations of Credit Risk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide services in a broad range of geographic regions. Our credit risk primarily consists of receivables from a variety of customers including general contractors, property owners and developers and commercial and industrial companies. We are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States within the nonresidential construction industry. However, we are entitled to payment for work performed and have certain lien rights in that work. Further, we believe that our contract acceptance, billing and collection policies are adequate to manage potential credit risk. We regularly review our accounts receivable and estimate an allowance for uncollectible amounts. We have a diverse customer base, with no single customer accounting for more than 3% of consolidated 2015 revenue.Financial Instruments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable, life insurance policies, notes to former owners, capital leases, and a revolving credit facility. We believe that the carrying values of these instruments on the accompanying balance sheets approximate their fair values.'

S'The financial statements\rof the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;US GAAP&#148;)\rand are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company&#146;s fiscal year end is November 30.The preparation of\rfinancial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\ramounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and\rthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current\rfacts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\rwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses\rthat are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely\rfrom the Company&#146;s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future\rresults of operations will be affected.The Company considers\rall highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. As of November\r30, 2013 and 2012, there were no cash equivalents.c)In accordance with\rASC 360, &#147;Property Plant and Equipment&#148;, the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability\rwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger\ra review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in\rthe business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the\racquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast\rof continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be\rsold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount\rof the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result\rfrom the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is\rrecognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.The Company computes\rnet income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260,Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic\rand diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income\r(loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the\rperiod. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock\rmethod and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the\rperiod is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted\rEPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. During the twelve months ended November 30, 2013 and\r2012, the Company has no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding..  The Company accounts\rfor income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,Accounting for Income Taxes. The asset\rand liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences\rof temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax\rcredit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will\rbe in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets\rto the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.ASC\r220,Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components\rin the financial statements. During the twelve months ended November 30, 203 and 2012 our net loss was identical to our comprehensive\rloss.The\rCompany recognizes revenue from online advertising.  Revenue will be recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable,\rpersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been provided, and collectability is assured.  The Company\ris not exposed to any credit risks as amounts are prepaid prior to performance of services.Pursuant to ASC 820,Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the\ruse of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent,\robjective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument&#146;s categorization within the fair\rvalue hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes\rthe inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:Level\r1Level 1 applies to\rassets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level\r2Level 2 applies to\rassets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as\rquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets\rwith insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs\rare observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.Level 3Level 3 applies to\rassets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement\rof the fair value of the assets or liabilities.The Company&#146;s\rfinancial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and amounts due to related party.\rPursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of cash is determined based on &#147;Level 1&#148; inputs, which consist of quoted prices in\ractive markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values\rbecause of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.The Company records\rstock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,Compensation &#150; Stock Compensationusing the fair value method.\rAll transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted\rfor based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more\rreliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured\rand recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued.  As at November 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company had\rnot grant any stock options. The Company has reviewed\rall the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe that the future adoption of any\rsuch pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations as reported\rin its financial statements.Certain\rreclassifications have been made to the 2012 and March 15, 2010 (inception) to November 30, 2012 financial statements to conform\rto the 2013 presentation Advertising costs are\rexpensed as incurred. The Company recorded no advertising costs for during the twelve months ended November 30, 2013 or 2012.'

S'2.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and\rhighly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records its allowance for doubtful\raccounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable\rbalances, credit quality of the Company&#146;s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers&#146;\rability to pay. Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or\rmarket and cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory is primarily comprised of finished goods. As of December\r31, 2015, the majority of our inventory related to Government and Commercial Identity products for intended near-term sales. Long-Lived Assets and Impairment of Long-Lived\rAssets The Company&#146;s long-lived assets include\rproperty and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for\rimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable\rin accordance with ASC topic 350 and ASC Topic 360 to determine recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates\rthe probability that future undiscounted net cash flows, without interest charges, will be less than the carrying amount of the\rassets. Impairment is measured at fair value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost\rand are depreciated over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten-years using the straight-line method. Leasehold\rimprovements are amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or estimated useful life\rof the asset. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition\rcost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Pursuant to ASC Topic 350, the Company tests goodwill\rfor impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or between annual tests, in certain circumstances. Under guidance, the\rCompany first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill\rimpairment test. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based\ron a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Events or changes\rin circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost\rfactors, overall financial performance, other entity specific events and sustained decrease in share price. The Company performed its annual impairment\rtest of goodwill in the fourth quarter for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the\rCompany determined no impairment charge was required. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized an impairment\rcharge of $4,207,000. See Note 5 for further details. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include trade names, patents,\rdeveloped technology and non-contractual customer relationships as described more fully in Note 5. The Company uses the straight\rline method to amortize these assets over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment\rwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable in accordance\rwith ASC Topic 360. To determine recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted\rnet cash flows, without interest charges, will be less than the carrying amount of the assets. Impairment is measured at fair value.\rNo impairments were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Deferred Rent The Company received certain rent abatements\rand incentives from landlord as an inducement to move into its New York office facility. The Company is amortizing these incentives\ron a straight line basis over the period of its respective lease. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Revenue is generally recognized when persuasive\revidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable, collectability is probable, and there\ris no future Company involvement or commitment. The Company sells its commercial products directly through its sales force and\rthrough distributors. Revenue from directsales of products is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed. Under the provisions of ASC Topic 605-25, &#147;Revenue\rArrangements with Multiple Deliverables,&#148; for multi-element arrangements that include tangible products containing software\ressential to the tangible product&#146;s functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible product&#146;s\ressential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances,\rthe Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific\robjective evidence of fair value (&#147;VSOE&#148;), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price and (iii) best estimate of the\rselling price (&#147;ESP&#148;). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price\ractually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company&#146;s best estimates of what the selling prices\rof elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company also recognizes revenues from licensing\rof its patented software to customers. The licensed software requires continuing service or post contractual customer support and\rperformance; accordingly, a portion of the revenue is deferred based on its fair value and recognized ratably over the period in\rwhich the future service, support and performance are provided, which is generally one to three years. Royalties from the licensing\rof the Company&#146;s technology are recognized as revenues in the period they are earned. Revenue from research and development contracts\rare generally with government agencies under long-term cost-plus fixed-fee contracts, where revenue is based on time and material\rcosts incurred. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as time is spent on the contract and materials are purchased. Research\rand development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company also performs consulting work for\rother companies. These services are billed based on time and materials. Revenue from these arrangements is also recognized as time\ris spent on the contract and materials are purchased. Subscriptions to database information can be\rpurchased for month-to-month, one, two, and three year periods. Revenue from subscriptions are deferred and recognized over the\rcontractual period, which is typically three years. The Company offers enhanced extended warranties\rfor its sales of hardware and software at a set price. The revenue from these sales are deferred and recognized on a straight-line\rbasis over the contractual period, which is typically one to three years. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are charged\rto expense as incurred. Shipping Costs The Company&#146;s shipping and handling costs\rare included in cost of revenues for all periods presented. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes\runder in accordance with ASC Topic 740, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes.&#148; Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized\rfor the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing\rassets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\rare measured using expected tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered\ror settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management&#146;s judgment that realization is more likely than not.\rThe Company has recorded a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, due to the\runcertainty of the realizability of those assets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company adheres to the provisions of ASC\rTopic 820, &#147;Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures&#148;. This pronouncement requires that the Company calculate the fair\rvalue of financial instruments and include this additional information in the notes to financial statements when the fair value\ris different than the book value of those financial instruments. The Company&#146;s financial instruments include cash and cash\requivalents, accounts receivable, note receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying\rvalue of the Company&#146;s financial instruments approximated fair value, due to their short-term nature. Business Concentration and Credit Risk Financial instruments, which subject the Company\rto concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash with one financial\rinstitution. The cash equivalents consist of money market funds. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit\rstanding of these institutions. The Company&#146;s sales are principally made\rto large retail customers, financial institutions concentrated in the United States of America and to U.S. government entities.\rThe Company performs ongoing credit evaluations, generally does not require collateral, and establishes an allowance for doubtful\raccounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the\rCompany had one customer that accounted for 31% of revenue. The revenue was associated with a commercial identity sales customer.\rThis customer represented 11% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company\rdid not have any single customer account for 10% of revenue. At December 31, 2014, the Company had five customers whose accounts\rreceivable exceeded 10% of accounts receivable and represented 54% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had three\rsuppliers for the production of its input devices. The Company has modified its software to operate in windows based systems and\rcan integrate with different hardware platforms that are readily available in the marketplace. The Company does not maintain a\rmanufacturing facility of its own and is not dependent on maintaining its production relationships due to the flexibility of its\rsoftware to run on multiple existing platforms. Net Loss and Net Loss Per Share Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing\rthe net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per\rshare is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially\rdilutive common stock outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and restricted stock is reflected\rin diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes\rall anti-dilutive shares.  The following table summarizes the common\rstock equivalents excluded from loss per diluted share because their effect would be anti-dilutive:  Share Based Compensation The Company accounts for the issuance\rof equity awards to employees in accordance ASC Topic 715 and 505, which requires that the cost resulting from all share based\rpayment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. This pronouncement establishes fair value as the measurement objective\rin accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in\raccounting for all share based payment transactions with employees. Period compensation costs are included in selling, general\rand administrative and research and development expenses. The Company recognizes compensation\rexpense related to stock option grants on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Comprehensive Loss The Company&#146;s comprehensive loss\ris equal to its net loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Segment Information The Company adheres to the provisions\rof ASC Topic 280, which establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments\rin annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in financial\rstatements issued to shareholders. Management has determined that it has only one reporting segment. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company&#146;s financial\rstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make\restimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Company&#146;s financial statements and accompanying notes.\rSignificant estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements include impairment of goodwill and\rintangible assets, deferred tax valuation allowances, allowances for doubtful accounts, revenue allocation of multi-element arrangements\rand the fair value of options granted under the Company&#146;s share based compensation plans. Due to the inherent uncertainties\rinvolved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from those estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet\rEffective In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards\rBoard (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2014-09,&#147;Revenue from Contracts with\rCustomers (Topic 606).&#148; ASU 2014-09 completes the joint effort by the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board\r(&#147;IASB&#148;) to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and International\rFinancial Reporting Standards (&#147;IFRS&#148;). ASU 2014-09 applies to all companies that enter into contracts with customers\rto transfer goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning\rin the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2017 for public companies. . The Company\ris currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2014-09 and have not yet determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,Presentation of Financial Statements &#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#146;s\rAbility to Continue as a Going Concern(&#147;ASU 2014-15&#148;) which defines management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate,\rat each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s\rability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and to provide related\rfootnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In connection with each annual and interim period, management must assess if there\ris substantial doubt about the company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date.\rDisclosures are required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt. This standard is effective for all companies in the first\rannual period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently\revaluating the requirements of ASU 2014-15 and has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,Inventory(Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory(&#147;ASU 2015-11&#148;) which changes the measurement\rprinciple for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 defines net\rrealizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion,\rdisposal, and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for periods beginning after\rDecember 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have\ron its financial statements and related disclosures. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,Income Taxes(Topic 740):Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxeswhich simplifies the presentation\rof deferred income taxes by eliminating the separate classification of deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current\rand noncurrent amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. The amendments in the update require that all deferred tax liabilities\rand assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective for annual\rperiods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively\rto all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance is expected\rto have on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU\rNo. 2016-02,Leases, which requires that lease arrangements longer than 12 months result in an entity recognizing an asset\rand liability. The pronouncement is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The\rCompany is currently evaluating the impact this guidance is expected to have on its consolidated financial statements.'

S"Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Ltd., Universal Display Corporation Korea, Inc., Universal Display Corporation Japan, Inc. and UDC Ireland Limited.  All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.Management&#8217;s Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the area of revenue recognition for license agreements, useful life of acquired technology, stock-based compensation and the valuation of stock warrant and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Cash, Cash Equivalents and InvestmentsThe Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining investments as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders&#8217; equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method.   Investments at December 31,2012and2011consist of the following (in thousands):On July 13, 2012, the Company entered into athree-year joint development agreement with Plextronics, Inc. (Plextronics), a private company engaged in printed solar, lighting and other electronics related research and development. Under the joint development agreement, the Company is committed to pay$1 millionper year to Plextronics forthreeyears. In addition, the Company invested$4 millionin Plextronics through the purchase of a convertible promissory note. The Company also received warrants in connection with the purchase of the convertible note. The note accrues interest at the rate of3%per year and is due and payable by June 30, 2013. The note is included in short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.  Depending on certain conditions, the note may either convert automatically, or if other certain conditions are met, the Company has the option to convert the note into shares of Plextronics&#8217; preferred stock at a specified conversion price.On July 17, 2012, the Company invested$300,000in a private company engaged in plasma processing equipment research and development (the Borrower) through the purchase of a convertible promissory note. The note accrues interest at the rate of5%per year and is due and payable by August 1, 2015. The note is included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has the option to convert the note into shares of the Borrower&#8217;s preferred stock at a specified conversion price.All short-term investments held atDecember 31, 2012will mature within one year.  Long-term investments held at December 31, 2012 will mature between February 2014 and July 2015.Trade Accounts ReceivableTrade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect and do not bear interest. The Company considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms.  The Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balance is a result of chemical sales, royalties, license fees and U.S. government contract revenues.  These receivables have historically been paid timely.  Due to the nature of the accounts receivable balance, the Company believes there is no significant risk of collection.  If the financial condition of the Company&#8217;s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, allowances for doubtful accounts would be required.  The Company recorded no bad debt expense in the years ended December 31,2012,2011and2010.  InventoryInventory, which consists of materials that have been classified as commercial, is valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. Commercial materials are materials that have been validated by the Company for use in commercial OLED products.Fair Value MeasurementsThe following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as ofDecember 31, 2012(in thousands):The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as ofDecember 31, 2011(in thousands):Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management&#8217;s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability&#8217;s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.Our convertible promissory note investments were initially recorded at cost and are classified within both short-term and long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.These convertible promissory note investments are inherently risky as the notes lack a ready market for resale, and the note issuer's success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile, and other key business factors. The companies we have invested in could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as mergers and private sales.We determine the fair value of our convertible promissory note investments portfolio quarterly.  The fair value of our convertible promissory note investments is determined through the consideration of whether the investee is experiencing financial difficulty.  Management performs an evaluation of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future.  The evaluation requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances affecting the investee, which may impact the fair value of the investment, such as:     If the fair value of a convertible promissory note investment is below our carrying value, the asset will be written down to its fair value with a resulting charge to net income. Temporary impairments result in a write down of the investment to its fair value with the charge reported in shareholders' equity.  There were no impairments of non-marketable convertible debt as of December 31, 2012.The following table is a reconciliation of the changes in fair value of the Company&#8217;s investments in convertible notes for the year ended December 31, 2012, which had been classified in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):The following table is a reconciliation of the changes in fair value of the Company&#8217;s stock warrant liability for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, which had been classified in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (in thousands): The fair value of the stock warrant liability was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following inputs at December 31:Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable approximate fair value in the accompanying financial statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company&#8217;s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments are carried at fair value as noted above.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of30 years for building,15 years for building improvements, andthreetosevenyears for office and lab equipment and furniture and fixtures. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions and betterments are capitalized.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsCompany management continually evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances might indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision, or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows in measuring whether the long-lived asset should be written down to fair value. Measurement of the amount of impairment would be based on generally accepted valuation methodologies, as deemed appropriate. As of December 31,2012, Company management believed that no revision to the remaining useful lives or write-down of the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets was required, and similarly, no such revisions were required for the years ended December 31,2011or2010.Stock Warrant LiabilityThe Company had warrants to purchase shares of common stock outstanding containing a &#8220;down-round&#8221; provision.  In accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815,Derivatives and Hedging, the fair value of these warrants was required to be reported as a liability, with the changes of fair value recorded on the statement of operations.  The change in fair value of these warrants resulted in a non-cash loss on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statement of operations of$4.2 millionand$10.1 millionfor the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, all remaining outstanding stock warrants to purchase shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were exercised.The fair value of the stock warrant liability was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as noted above in &#8220;Fair Value Measurements.&#8221;Net Income (Loss) Per Common ShareBasic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, excluding unvested restricted stock awards.  Diluted net income (loss) per common share reflects the potential dilution from the exercise or conversion of securities into common stock, the effect of unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the ESPP. The following table is a reconciliation of net income (loss) and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for the years ended December 31,2012,2011and2010(in thousands, except share and per share data):For the year ended December 31, 2012, the combined effects of outstanding stock options, and unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, and outstanding stock options of212,941, and the impact of shares to be issued under the ESPP, which was minor, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, the effect of586,972warrants prior to their exercise was excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as the impact would have been antidilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the effects of the assumed exercise of the combined outstanding stock options and warrants and unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units of3,165,048and the impact of shares to be issued under the ESPP, which was minor, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as the impact would have been antidilutive.Revenue Recognition and Deferred RevenueMaterial sales relate to the Company&#8217;s sale of its OLED materials, for incorporation into its customers&#8217; commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time of shipment or at time of delivery, and passage of title, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties.The Company has received non-refundable advance license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements. Certain of the payments under development and technology evaluation agreements are creditable against future amounts payable under commercial license agreements that the parties may subsequently enter into and, as such, are deferred until such commercial license agreements are executed or negotiations have ceased and Company management determines that there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a commercial license agreement with the other party. Revenue would then be recognized over the term of the agreement or the expected useful life of the relevant licensed technology, for perpetual licenses, if there is an effective commercial license agreement or amounts are not creditable against future commercial license fees, or at the time Company management determines that there is no appreciable likelihood of an executable commercial license agreement. Amounts deferred are classified as current and non-current based upon current contractual remaining terms; however, based upon on-going relationships with customers, as well as future agreement extensions, amounts classified as current as of December 31, 2012, may not be recognized as revenue over the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2012,$7.4 millionwas recorded as deferred revenue, of which$1.5 millionis creditable against future commercial license agreements that have not yet been executed or deemed effective. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2010, respectively,$1.9 millionand$2.1 millionof revenue was recognized relating to cash payments received that were creditable against license fees and/or royalties for which the Company determined there was no appreciable likelihood of executing a commercial license agreement with the customer.  For arrangements with extended payment terms where the fee is not fixed and determinable, the Company recognizes revenue when the payment is due and payable. Royalty revenue is recognized when earned and the amount is fixed and determinable.Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which includes reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs in relation to its government contracts. Revenues are recognized proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved.Included in accounts receivable as of December 31,2012and2011are unbilled receivables of$308,000and$870,000, respectively. All amounts are billed and due within one year. Cost of Material SalesCost of material sales represents costs associated with the sale of materials that have been classified as commercial.Research and DevelopmentExpenditures for research and development are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of the following (in thousands):Patent Costs and Amortization of Acquired TechnologyCosts associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense.  Amortization costs relate to acquired technology from FUJIFILM and Motorola in 2012 and 2011, respectively.Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency TransactionsThe Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which it believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive  loss.  The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date have been insignificant.Statement of Cash Flow InformationThe following non-cash activities occurred (in thousands):During the year ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company paid cash of$5.3 million,$2.0 million, and$330,000for income taxes.Income TaxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. The Company accounts for the sale of its state net operating losses on a cash basis; therefore, it does not record an income tax benefit until the cash is received. The Company classifies interest and penalties, if any, as a component of tax expense.Share-Based Payment AwardsThe Company recognizes in the statements of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation, such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards and units and stock appreciation rights (SARs), issued to employees and directors.The grant-date fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures.  The Company relies primarily upon historical experience to estimate expected forfeitures and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis from the date of the grant.  The Company issues new shares upon the exercise or vesting of share-based payment awards.Cash-settled SARs awarded in share-based payment transactions are classified as liability awards; accordingly, the Company records these awards as a component of accrued expenses on its consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of each SAR is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is remeasured at each reporting period until the award is settled. Changes in the fair value of the liability award are recorded as expense or income in the statements of operations.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended standards that revised the application of the valuation premise of highest and best use of an asset, the application of premiums and discounts for fair value determination, as well as the required disclosures for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measures and the highest and best use of nonfinancial assets. The update provides additional disclosures regarding Level 3 fair value measurements and clarifies certain other existing disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations or financial position.In June 2011, the FASB issued amended standards for the reporting of other comprehensive income.  The amendments require that all non-owner changes in shareholders&#8217; equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.  In either case, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.  Regardless of which option is chosen, the entity is required to present on the face of the financial statements any adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. In December 2011, the FASB issued additional standards which defer specific requirements to present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The new guidance is effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. This new guidance did not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations or financial position, but changed the Company&#8217;s presentation of comprehensive income (loss).In February 2013, the FASB issued amended standards that revised the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and addressed certain matters from the June 2011 standards for reporting of other comprehensive income that were deferred pending additional consideration.  The amendment requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, entities are required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.  For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, entities are required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail on these amounts. This guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. This new guidance will not have an impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations or financial position, but may change the Company&#8217;s presentation of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), and/or disclosures to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements."

S'Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsInventory Measurement (Evaluating)In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-11, which amended Inventory (Topic 330) Related to Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory of the Accounting Standards Codification. The amended guidance applies to all inventory except that which is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. Inventory measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost is included in the new amendments. Inventory within the scope of the new guidance should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. The amendments will take effect for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The new guidance should be applied prospectively, and earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.&nbsp; The Company does not expect this standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.&nbsp;Contract Revenue Recognition (Evaluating)In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 which was amended in August 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;This standard amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) of the Accounting Standards Codification. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will apply the guidance using a modified retrospective approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company does not expect this standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.'

S'Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EndoChoice Holdings, Inc. (formerly ECPM Holdings, LLC prior to the corporate conversion discussed above; EndoChoice Innovation Center, Ltd.; EndoChoice GmbH; and Robert S. Smith, M.D., Inc. d/b/a EndoChoice Pathology ("EC Pathology")). The Company also owns a67%interest in EndoChoice Israel, Ltd., which had no material transactions during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. All significant intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.Foreign Exchange TransactionsThe Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars (USD). Its foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency and maintain their records in the local currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into USD using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and equity accounts are translated into USD using historical rates. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect when the transaction occurs. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. Transactions denominated in foreign currency are remeasured at exchange rates at the date of transaction with foreign currency gains (losses) recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. The Company recognized net foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of$(1,521),$(1,027)and$202for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangibles, tax related contingencies and valuation allowances, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, litigation contingencies, and certain accrued liabilities. Estimates are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ given the inherent uncertainty of estimates.Cash and Cash Equivalents    The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid marketable securities with remaining maturities at the purchase date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company invests the majority of its cash in interest-bearing accounts in U.S. banks, and the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries maintain cash accounts denominated in Euros and Shekels. Foreign currency accounts are remeasured to U.S. dollars at each month-end. At times, deposit balances in the U.S. may exceed the FDIC insured limit. The Company had$16,104of money market funds classified as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015. The Company heldnomoney market funds classified as cash equivalents as of December 31, 2014.Marketable SecuritiesThe Company&#8217;s short-term and long-term marketable securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate securities. The Company&#8217;s marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of stockholders&#8217; equity. Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument&#8217;s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable securities not classified as cash equivalents that have remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term marketable securities, and marketable securities with remaining maturities one year or greater are classified as long-term marketable securities. The cost of marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method. In addition, interest income for marketable debt securities is recorded when earned using an effective yield method, giving effect to the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.The Company regularly reviews its marketable securities portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company&#8217;s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company&#8217;s assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsTrade accounts receivable are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at outstanding amounts, less the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is set at a level that represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable balance. The allowance is based on various factors, including an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts. In circumstances where a specific customer&#8217;s inability to meet its financial obligations is known or expected, we record a specific provision for bad debts to reduce the receivable to the amount that we believe will be collected. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is deemed to be uncollectible.During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded bad debt expense of$979,$466, and$992, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of$940and$860, respectively.InventoriesInventories are valued at lower of cost or market value. Cost includes all purchase, conversion, and other direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location. Wages and other related benefit costs of employees directly attributable to the production process and an allocated portion of other indirect production expenses (overhead) are included in inventory costs. Overhead includes both fixed and variable expenses which are allocated to inventory produced on a systematic basis. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand in consideration of projected future demand, product life cycles, design changes, and remaining shelf life to record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when appropriate.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the respective assets:Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life or lease term. Upon retirement or disposal of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the Company&#8217;s accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in the period of retirement or disposal.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and intangible assets and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of an asset in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the asset. If circumstances indicate potential impairment of a long-lived asset, the Company compares the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset to the carrying amount of the asset. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The Company determines fair value using the income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows or other appropriate measures of estimated fair value. In 2015, the Company recorded impairment charges of$1,070, primarily related to the replacement of certain demonstration equipment with newer versions of Fuse&#174;as indicated in Note 6. No impairment charges related to long-lived assets were recorded during 2014 and 2013.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets from the businesses that we acquire. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The annual impairment test is conducted as of September 30.The Company reviews goodwill for impairment by applying a quantitative impairment analysis using the two step method. Under the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired, and we are not required to perform additional analysis. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company will recognize the amount of the impairment loss for any excess carrying amount of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. As of December 31, 2015, there has been no impairment of goodwill.Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates revenue primarily from the sales of GI products and pathology services. The Company sells products through direct sales representatives in the U.S. and Germany and independent distributors in international markets. Sales to distributors are recorded when title and risk of loss transfer. No direct sales customers or distributors have price protection.We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) delivery obligations to the customer related to the products or services have been satisfied; (3) the arrangement consideration is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of the revenues is reasonably assured. GI pathology service revenue is recognized as services are performed, net of estimated reimbursement adjustments by payors. These adjustments include contractual write-downs under health insurance contracts, rebates for billing errors, and out-of-network charges. These estimates are based on the terms of contracts with health insurance payors and historical collections experience. Revenue from endoscope repair services, included in GI equipment and supplies revenue, are recognized ratably over the life of the contract. Deferred revenue is recorded for consideration received that is not yet earned due to outstanding obligations related to sales of products and services. The Company&#8217;s policy is to classify shipping and handling costs billed to customers as revenues and the related expenses as costs of revenues.Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and, therefore, are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.The Company accrues estimated warranty reserves at the time of shipment based on contractual obligations and historical experience of related repair costs. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had an allowance for estimated warranty claims of$922and$207, respectively, included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Cost of RevenuesCost of revenues consist primarily of manufacturing overhead costs, direct material costs, and direct labor. A significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of manufacturing overhead costs, which include the cost of quality assurance, material procurement, inventory control, warehousing and shipment, facilities, equipment and operations supervision and management. Cost of revenues also includes depreciation expense for production equipment and certain direct costs such as shipping costs.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development costs, including new product development, regulatory compliance and clinical research, are charged to operations as incurred in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Such costs include personnel-related costs, supplies, services, depreciation, allocated facilities overhead and information services, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, fees paid to investigative sites and other indirect costs. Research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 includes$1,345,$3,422, and$5,749, respectively, of labor and overhead costs associated with certain engineering activities required to advance the design of the Fuse&#174; product for manufacture.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation &#8212; Stock Compensation. The Company measures stock-based compensation cost at grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost of awards expected to vest over the requisite service period.The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the closing price of the Company&#8217;s stock on the grant date. The fair value of stock option awards and employee stock purchase plan grants are determined on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model (&#8220;Black-Scholes model&#8221;). The determination of fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes model is affected by the Company\'s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include but are not limited to the expected dividend yield, expected volatility over the term of the award, risk-free interest rate, expected term, and the actual and projected employee option exercise behavior.Expected dividend yield:A zero percent dividend yield is assumed as the Company has not paid and does not expect to pay dividends on common stock.Expected volatility:Volatility is estimated for each stock option grant based on a study of publicly traded industry peer companies. In evaluating similarity, the Company considered factors such as industry, stage of development, and size.Risk-free interest rate:The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options.Expected term: The expected term represents the period that option awards are expected to be outstanding. Due to our limited trading history as a public company as well as limitations on the sale or transfer of stock-based compensation awards granted prior to the initial public offering discussed in Note 1, we do not believe our historical exercise pattern is indicative of the pattern that we will experience as a publicly traded company. We have consequently used the simplified method available under Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB) 110 to calculate the expected term, which utilizes the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.In the event the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities result in deferred tax assets, an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such assets is required. A valuation allowance is provided for the portion of the deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable earnings, and tax planning strategies.The income tax benefit or expense is the total current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; test, no tax benefit is recorded. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has not identified any uncertain tax positions that require adjustment to or disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company&#8217;s federal and state income tax returns since 2011 are subject to examination by tax authorities and may change upon examination.Comprehensive Income (Loss)Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that under U.S. GAAP are included in comprehensive income (loss) but are excluded from net earnings, as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders&#8217; equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale marketable securities. These amounts are presented in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and redeemable members\' capital and stockholders&#8217; equity/members\' deficit.Fair ValueFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date under current market conditions. The Company categorizes its financial assets and liabilities into a three-level hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation, pursuant to the Fair Value Measurements and disclosures of ASC Topic 820. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement of the instrument.Level 1   Quoted prices available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date; Level 2   Inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date; and,Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability. These inputs reflect management judgment about the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability.Net Loss per Common ShareBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. Stock options, warrants, and restricted shares are considered to be common stock equivalents and are evaluated for dilutive effect using the treasury-stock method. Basic and diluted net loss per common share are the same for years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 due to the Company\'s reported net losses during those periods and the exclusion of dilutive common stock equivalents from diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding.'

S'Principles of Consolidation We consolidate entities when we have the ability to control the operating and financial decisions and policies of that entity and record the portion we do not own as non-controlling interest. The determination of our ability to control, or exert significant influence over, an entity involves the use of judgment. We apply the equity method of accounting if we can exert significant influence over, but do not control the policies and decisions of an entity. We use the cost method of accounting if we are unable to exert significant influence over the entity. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, investments, intangible assets and goodwill, property, plant and equipment, income taxes, employment benefits and contingent liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value U. S. generally accepted accounting principles defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. The three levels are as follows: Level 1 &#150; Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2 &#150; Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 &#150; Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which we make our own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets and liabilities. The following describes the valuation methodologies used by us to measure fair value: Real estate held for sale is recorded at fair value less selling costs. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are recorded at carrying value and tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, using projections of undiscounted future cash flows. Interest rate swaps are adjusted on a recurring basis pursuant to accounting standards for fair value measurements. We categorize our interest rate swap as Level 2 for fair value measurement. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider short-term investments with an original maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash accounts in major U.S. financial institutions. The terms of these deposits are on demand to minimize risk. The balances of these accounts occasionally exceed the federally insured limits, although no losses have been incurred in connection with such cash balances. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We establish provisions for losses on accounts and notes receivable if we determine that we will not collect all or part of the outstanding balance. We regularly review collectability and establish or adjust our allowance as necessary using the specific identification method. We make advances to third parties under executed promissory notes for project costs related to the development of gaming and entertainment properties. Due diligence is conducted by our management with the assistance of legal counsel prior to entering into arrangements with third parties to provide financing in connection with their efforts to secure and develop the properties. Repayment terms are largely dependent upon the operating performance of each opportunity for which the funds have been loaned. Interest income is not accrued until it is reasonably assured that the project will be completed and that there will be sufficient profits from the facility to cover the interest to be earned under the respective note. If projected cash flows are not sufficient to recover amounts due, the note is evaluated to determine the appropriate discount to be recorded on the note for it to be considered a performing loan. If the note is performing, interest is recorded using the effective interest method based on the value of the discounted note balance. Each reporting period we review each of our receivables to evaluate whether the collection of such receivable is still probable. In our analysis, we review the economic feasibility and the current financial, legislative and development status of the project. If our analysis indicates that the project is no longer economically feasible then the receivable would be written down to its estimated fair value. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and payable, and long term debt. At April 30, 2014 and April 30, 2013, we had three notes receivable, as well as the BVD/BVO receivable, outstanding. Two of these notes were issued in connection with a potential gaming project and the third was to the investors who purchased the Colorado Grande Casino from us. Management performs periodic evaluations of the collectability of these notes. Our cash deposits are held with large, well-known financial institutions, and, at times, such deposits may be in excess of the federally insured limit. The recorded value of cash, accounts receivable and payable, approximate fair value based on their short term nature; the recorded value of long term debt approximates fair value as interest rates approximate current market rates. Capitalized Development Cost We capitalize certain third party, professional, and other miscellaneous fees directly related to the procurement, evaluation and establishment of contracts for development projects. Development costs are recorded on the cost basis and are amortized over the estimated economic term of the contract. We review each project on an annual basis to assess whether any changes to our estimates are appropriate. If accumulated costs of a specific project exceed the net realizable value of such project, or if the project is abandoned, the costs are charged to earnings. Real Estate Held for Sale Real estate held for sale consists of undeveloped land located in and around Black Hawk, Colorado. Property held for sale is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Property and Equipment Expenditures for property and equipment are capitalized at cost. We depreciate property and equipment over their respective estimated useful lives, ranging from three to thirty years, using the straight-line method. When items are retired or otherwise disposed of, a gain or loss is recorded for the difference between net book value and proceeds realized. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings, and replacements and betterments are capitalized. Property and equipment at April 30, 2014 and April 30, 2013 consist of the following: Deferred Loan Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are capitalized and amortized over the expected terms of the related debt agreements and are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of our goodwill below its carrying value. We review goodwill at the reporting level unit, which is the same as our operating segments. We compare the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, based upon a multiple of estimated earnings. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment indicator exists and an estimate of the impairment loss is calculated. The fair value calculation uses level 3 inputs and includes multiple assumptions and estimates, including the projected cash flows and discount rates applied. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in goodwill impairment that could materially adversely impact our financial position or results of operations. All of our goodwill is attributable to reporting units within our gaming segment. We use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charges, litigation charges, and net losses/gains from asset dispositions (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) as the measure for future earnings in our impairment test. Management estimates future adjusted EBITDA based primarily on its projections of future revenues. We utilized comparable industry average multiples of adjusted EBITDA rates based on industry standards ranging from4.5to7.5times adjusted EBITDA for the estimated fair values of our operating facilities as of April 30, 2014. Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets also comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets if impairment indicators are present or if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist under authoritative guidance. When management believes impairment indicators may exist, projections of the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the use of and eventual disposition of long-lived assets held for use are prepared. If the projections indicate that the carrying values of the long-lived assets are not recoverable, we reduce the carrying values to fair value. For property held for sale, we compare the carrying values to an estimate of fair value less selling costs to determine potential impairment. We test for impairment of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are measurable. These impairment tests are heavily influenced by assumptions and estimates that are subject to change as additional information becomes available. Slot Club Awards We reward our slot customers for their loyalty based on the dollar amount of play on slot machines. We accrue for these slot club awards based on an estimate of the value of the outstanding awards utilizing the age and prior history of redemptions. Future events such as a change in our marketing strategy or new competition could result in a change in the value of the awards. Advertising Costs We expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense related primarily to our casino operations and for the years ended April 30, 2014 and April 30, 2013 was approximately $2,097,000and $2,067,000, respectively. These costs are included in marketing and administrative on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue Recognition We record revenues from casino operations and interest on notes receivable on the accrual basis as earned. The dates on which payments are collected may vary depending upon the term of the contracts or note receivable agreements. Interest income related to notes receivable is recorded when earned and its collectability is reasonably certain. The retail value of food and beverage and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and deducted as promotional allowances. Net revenues do not include the retail amount of food, beverage and other items provided gratuitously to customers. We record the redemption of coupons and points for cash as a reduction of revenue as they are earned. These amounts are included in promotional allowances in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.The estimated cost of providing such complimentary services that is included in casino expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was as follows:  Accrued Jackpot Liability We accrue slot jackpot liability as games are played under a matching concept of coin-in. We also maintain accrued player-supported jackpot liabilities. Player-supported jackpot is a progressive game of chance, allowed in Washington State, directly related to the play or outcome of an authorized non-house-banked card game separately funded by our patrons. Any jackpots hit in these card games are paid from such reserved funds. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences, using currently enacted tax laws, attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We record current income taxes based on our current taxable income, and we provide for deferred income taxes to reflect estimated future tax payments and receipts. We account for tax credits under the flow-through method, which reduces the provision for income taxes in the year the tax credits first become available. We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance when, based on our estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period. We recognize the impact of uncertain tax positions in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authority. Should interest and penalty be incurred as a result of a review of our income tax returns, we will record the interest and penalty in accordance with applicable guidance. Our federal tax returns for years after 2010, which pertains to fiscal year 2011, remain subject to examination. Stock-Based Compensation Under ASC Topic 718,&#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation,&#8221; the fair value and compensation expense of each option award is estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock over a preceding period commensurate with the expected term of the option. The expected term of the option is an estimate of the time that the option is expected to be outstanding and is based on our historical experience. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected dividend yield was not considered in the option pricing formula since we historically have not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future. The compensation cost related to these share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period. The requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Total stock-based compensation for the years ended April 30, 2014 and April 30, 2013 was $54,479and $137,858, respectively. Earnings Per Share Earnings per share, both basic and diluted, are presented on the consolidated statement of operations. Basic earnings per common share amounts are calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share assumes the exercise of all stock options having exercise prices less than the average market price of the common stock using the &#8220;treasury stock method&#8221; and for convertible debt securities using the &#8220;if converted method&#8221;. Accrued Contingent Liabilities We assess our exposure to loss contingencies including legal matters. If a potential loss is justified, probable, able to be quantified, and material, we will provide for the exposure. If the actual loss from a contingency differs from management&#8217;s estimate, operating results could be impacted. As of April 30, 2014 and April 30, 2013, we did not record any accrued contingent liabilities. Derivative Financial Instruments We have managed our market risk, including interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings with the use of derivative financial instruments. The fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value affecting net income (loss). The Company&#8217;s interest rate swap did not qualify for hedge accounting. Accordingly, change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is presented as an increase (decrease) in fair value of swaps in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. New Accounting Pronouncements Since the filing of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2013, there are no new accounting standards effective which are material to our financial statements or that are required to be adopted by the Company.'

S"NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\rPOLICIES Basis of presentation The Company&#146;s financial statements have\rbeen prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).The\rpreparation offinancial statements\rinconformitywithaccounting principlesgenerally\racceptedintheUnited StatesofAmerica\rrequiresmanagementtomakeestimates\randassumptions\rthataffect\rthereported\ramountsof assetsandliabilities\randdisclosureofcontingent\rassetsandliabilitiesatthedateofthefinancial\rstatementsandthe reported\ramountsofrevenues\randexpensesduringthereporting\rperiod.\rActualresults\rcoulddifferfrom those estimates.

The Company is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business\rand, therefore, still qualifies as a development stage company. All losses accumulated since September 1, 2008 have been considered\ras part of the Company&#146;s development stage activities Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in\rconformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\rreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\rand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the estimated useful\rlives of property and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments\rwith a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Fair value of financial instruments The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10\rof the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37\rof the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#148;) to measure the fair value of its financial\rinstruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted\rin the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and\rcomparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which\rprioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy\rgives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority\rto unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below: The carrying amount of the Company&#146;s\rfinancial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the\rshort maturity of those instruments. The Company&#146;s notes payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon\rmanagement&#146;s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at\rMay 31, 2013. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities\rmeasured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis. Equipment Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures\rfor major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Depreciation\rof equipment is computed by the straight-line method (after taking into account their respective estimated residual values) over\rthe assets estimated useful life of three (3) or seven (7) years. Upon sale or retirement of equipment, the related cost and accumulated\rdepreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. Impairment of long-lived assets The Company follows paragraph 360-10-05-4 of\rthe FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company&#146;s long-lived assets, which includes computer\requipment is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset\rmay not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of\rits long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group\rof long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any,\ris based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the\rasset&#146;s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined\rto be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book\rvalues of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. The Company determined that there were no impairments\rof long-lived assets as of August 31, 2013. Commitments and contingencies The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the\rFASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies.  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising\rfrom claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has\rbeen incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Revenue recognition The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1\rof the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or\rrealizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met:\r(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,\r(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Income taxes The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the\rFASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future\rtax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax\rassets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using\renacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced\rby a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred\rtax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which\rthose temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change\rin tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the\rFASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Section 740-10-25&#148;) with regards to uncertainty income taxes. Section 740-10-25\raddresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the\rfinancial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if\rit is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical\rmerits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on\rthe largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section\r740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim\rperiods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income\rtax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25. Net income (loss) per common share Net income (loss) per common share is computed\rpursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed\rby dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net\rincome (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock\rand potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding\rand potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding\ras of August 31, 2013. Cash flows reporting The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24\rof the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether\rthey stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or\rreconciliation method (&#147;Indirect method&#148;) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification\rto report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities\rby removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating\rcash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.  The\rCompany reports the reporting currency equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current exchange rate at the time of\rthe cash flows and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is reported as a separate item in the\rreconciliation of beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately provides information about investing\rand financing activities not resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB\rAccounting Standards Codification. Advertising Costs The Company expenses the cost of advertising\rand promotional materials when incurred. Total Advertising costs were $0 for years ended August 31,2013 and 2012. Subsequent events The Company follows the guidance in Section\r855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent\revents through the date when the financial statements were issued.  Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting\rStandards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed\rto users, such as through filing them on EDGAR. Recently issued accounting pronouncements The following accounting standards were\rissued as of December 26, 2011:"

S'Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&nbsp;Business.Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") is an off-price retailer of first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family. At the end of fiscal 2010, the Company operated&nbsp;988Ross Dress for Less&#174;("Ross") locations in&nbsp;27 states and Guamand&nbsp;67dd\'s DISCOUNTS&#174;stores in&nbsp;sixstates, all of which are supported by&nbsp;fourdistribution centers. The&nbsp;Company\'s headquarters, one buying office, two distribution centers, and 26% of its storesare located in California.&nbsp;Segment reporting.The Company has one reportable segment. The Company\'s operations include only activities related to off-price retailing in stores throughout the United States.&nbsp;Basis of presentation and fiscal year.The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company follows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal years ended January 29, 2011, January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 are referred to as fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008, respectively, and had 52 weeks.&nbsp;Use of accounting estimates.The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company\'s significant accounting estimates include valuation reserves for inventory shortage, packaway inventory costs, useful lives of fixed assets, self-insurance reserves, and uncertain tax position reserves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchase obligations.As of January 29, 2011, the Company had purchase obligations of approximately $1,332million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $1,250million represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of January 29, 2011.&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents.Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.&nbsp;Investments.The Company\'s investments are comprised of various debt securities. At January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, these investments were classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Investments are classified as either short- or long-term based on their original maturities and the Company\'s intent. Investments with an original maturity of less than one year are classified as short-term. See Note B for additional information.&nbsp;Merchandise inventory.Merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted average basis) or net realizable value. The Company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the Company\'s warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway inventory accounted for approximately47% and38% of total inventories as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory.The cost of the Company\'s merchandise inventory is reduced by valuation reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the Company\'s physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts.&nbsp;Cost of goods sold.In addition toproduct costs, the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution and freight expenses as well as occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization related to the Company\'s retail stores, buying, and distribution facilities. Buying expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses include the cost of operating the Company\'s distribution centers.&nbsp;Property and equipment.Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from&nbsp;fiveto&nbsp;12years for equipment and&nbsp;20to&nbsp;40years for real property. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $160.7million, $159.0million, and $141.8million for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less. Computer hardware and software costs, net of amortization, of $102.0million and $106.7million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively, are included in fixtures and equipment and are amortized over their estimated useful life generally ranging from&nbsp;fiveto&nbsp;sevenyears. The Company capitalizes interest during the construction period. Interest capitalized was $0.1million and $1.8million in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.&nbsp;Other long-term assets.Other long-term assets as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010 consisted of the following:&nbsp;Other assetsare principally comprised of prepaid rent and other long-term prepayments.&nbsp;Property, other long-term assets, and certain identifiable intangibles that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, including goodwill, are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Based on the Company\'s evaluation during fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008, no impairment charges were recorded.&nbsp;Store closures.The Company continually reviews the operating performance of individual stores. For stores that are closed, the Company records a liability for future minimum lease payments net of estimated sublease recoveries and related ancillary costs at the time the liability is incurred. In 2010, the Company closed&nbsp;sixRoss stores. In 2009, the Company closed&nbsp;threeRoss and&nbsp;fourdd\'s DISCOUNTS locations. The lease loss liability related to certain of these closed stores was $4.9million and $6.2million, as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. Operating costs, including depreciation, of stores to be closed are expensed during the period they remain in use.&nbsp;Accounts payable.Accounts payable represents amounts owed to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable includes book cash overdrafts (checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet presented for payment) in excess of cash balances in such accounts of approximately $53.4million and $125.7million at January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. The Company includes the change in book cash overdrafts in operating cash flows.&nbsp;Self-insurance.The Company is self-insured for workers\' compensation, general liability insurance costs, and costs of certain medical plans. The self-insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-insurance reserves as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010 consisted of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers\' compensation and self-insured medical plan liabilities are included in accrued payroll and benefits, and accruals for general liability are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.&nbsp;Other long-term liabilities.Other long-term liabilities as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010 consisted of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;Lease accounting.When a lease contains "rent holidays" or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, the Company records rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. The Company&nbsp;begins recording rent expense on the lease possession date. Tenant improvement allowances are included in other long-term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. Changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.&nbsp;Estimated fair value of financial instruments.The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, accounts receivable, other long-term assets, accounts payable, and other long-term liabilities approximates their estimated fair value. See Note B and Note D for additional fair value information.&nbsp;Revenue recognition.The Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale and maintains an allowance for estimated future returns. Sales of gift cards are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of Company merchandise. Sales tax collected is not recognized as revenue and is included in accrued expenses and other.&nbsp;Allowance for sales returns.An allowance for the gross margin loss on estimated sales returns is included in accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for sales returns consists of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;Store pre-opening.Store pre-opening costs are expensed in the period incurred.&nbsp;Advertising.Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising costs for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $54.3million, $53.5million, and $53.9million, respectively.&nbsp;Stock-based compensation.The Company recognizes compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards, typically over the vesting period. See Note C for more information on the Company\'s stock-based compensation plans.&nbsp;Taxes on earnings.The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company\'s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than changes in the tax law or tax rates. ASC 740 also clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company\'s consolidated financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement standard for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. See Note F.&nbsp;Treasury stock.The Company records treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax withholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock grants.&nbsp;Earnings per share("EPS").The Company computes and reports both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the total potential dilution that could occur from outstanding equity plan awards, including unexercised stock options and unvested shares of both performance and non-performance based awards of restricted stock.&nbsp;In fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 there were3,200,19,800, and&nbsp;583,000weighted average shares, respectively, that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for those years.&nbsp;The following is a reconciliation of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales mix.The Company\'s sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008:&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive income.Comprehensive income consists of net earnings and other comprehensive income (loss), principally unrealized investment gains or losses. Components of comprehensive income are presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders\' equity.'

S"egx&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES4.&nbsp;Principles of Consolidation&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include those of the Company and its subsidiaries. One hundred percent of assets and liabilities as well as revenues and expenses of all consolidated companies are included. Receivables, payables, as well as revenues and expenses between consolidated companies are eliminated. Unrealized intercompany profits, which may be included in assets as of the end of the respective periods are also eliminated. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.&nbsp;Fiscal year&nbsp;The fiscal year of the Company and all its subsidiaries correspond with the calendar year.&nbsp;Use of estimates&nbsp;These consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;US GAAP&#148;) and require management to make assumptions and estimates, which have an impact on the reported assets and liabilities as well as on the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates. These considerations also impact reported income statement items. While the effective amounts may vary from the estimates, management is convinced that all relevant information having an impact on the estimates have been taken into consideration and are appropriately disclosed. Management believes that the valuation of property and equipment includes substantial estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents include petty cash, post and bank accounts as well as time deposits with maturities of less than three months.&nbsp;Other assets&nbsp;Other assets include items, such as value added tax, withholding tax or similar credits with maturities less than one year.&nbsp;Property and equipment&nbsp;Property and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation. Repair and maintenance expenses are charged to the income statement when incurred. The cost of fixed assets, including leasehold improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the following useful lives:&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet at the time of disposal. Project in process relates to costs incurred directly related to the planning and construction of the hotel in the Papagayo Gulf Tourism Project of Costa Rica and are reasonably recoverable from future hotel and rental operations or the sale of certain apartments. Once the project in process is finished the Company will reclassify the capitalized costs to corresponding categories and determine the depreciation method and depreciation period.&nbsp;Interest capitalization&nbsp;Interest expense is capitalized on the carrying value of the construction in progress during the construction period, in accordance with ASC 835-20,Capitalization of Interest. With respect to the construction in progress, the Company capitalized $6,030,000 and $3,254,000 of interest expense and debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively to property and equipment.&nbsp;Deposits related to construction work&nbsp;The Company prepays deposits for construction work, which costs are capitalized initially and will be amortized once construction has begun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED3.&nbsp;Debt issuance costs&nbsp;Debt issuance costs arise as a result of issuing debt, i.e. the EUR bonds, CHF bonds and the loan with Aires International Investments Inc., and are amortized over the life of the debt using the effective interest method. The costs comprise of finder's fees of generally between three and 12 percent of the amount issued and costs incurred in connection with issuing the bonds, such as legal and accounting fees, and stamp duty taxes. The accumulated amortization of debt issuance costs was $4,345,089 and $2,399,005 as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;Down payment for property and equipment&nbsp;Down payments for property and equipment are recorded at cost. Once the corresponding property and equipment item has been completely purchased, it will be reclassified to a corresponding subcategory within property and equipment and amortized. The Company assesses regularly if the down payments are recoverable in accordance with ASC 360Property, Plant, and Equipment.Should any down payments due to specific circumstances not be assessed as recoverable, they will be impaired.&nbsp;Restricted Cash&nbsp;Restricted cash includes cash that is not disposable for the Company without third party permission such as rental deposits or deposits related to the project in process. Based on the nature of the Company&#146;s underlying business it will be determined whether a deposit is recorded as a current or non-current asset.&nbsp;Impairment of Long-Lived Assets&nbsp;Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted expected cash flows from the asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices, where available, or is estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows from the asset or asset group discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED&nbsp;Income taxes&nbsp;The Company has not incurred material current taxes on income as it has not generated taxable income in any of the jurisdictions in which it operates.&nbsp;Deferred taxes are calculated on the temporary differences that arise between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying value on the balance sheet of the Company prepared for consolidation purposes, with the exception of temporary differences arising on investments in foreign subsidiaries where the Company has plans to permanently reinvest profits into the foreign subsidiaries.&nbsp;Deferred tax assets on tax loss carry-forwards are only recognized to the extent that it is more likely than not, that future profits will be available and the tax loss carry-forward can be utilized.&nbsp;Changes to tax laws or tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date are taken into account in the determination of the applicable tax rate provided that they are likely to be applicable in the period when the deferred tax assets or tax liabilities are realized.&nbsp;The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States of America, Switzerland and Costa Rica. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.&nbsp;The Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax position. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as income tax expense.&nbsp;Concentration of risks&nbsp;Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand. Cash and cash equivalents are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED3.&nbsp;Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented in US Dollars (&#147;$&#148;) which is also the functional currency of the parent company. The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are determined using the currency of the environment in which an entity primarily generates and expends cash as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Statement of comprehensive loss accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#146; deficit. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income and expenses (exchange differences), except intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term-investment nature which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders&#146; equity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonds&nbsp;Bonds comprise of bonds payable in Euros (&#147;EUR&#148;) and Swiss Francs (&#147;CHF&#148;), which bear fixed interest rates. Bonds are carried at notional value. If a bond becomes repayable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date on, such bond or the corresponding portion of this bond will be categorized as current. Commissions paid to bondholders themselves are reflected as debt discounts and amortized over the term of the bond, based on the &#147;effective interest method&#148;. The amortization expense is reflected in amortization of debt issuance cost.Pension Plan&nbsp;The Company maintains a pension plan covering all employees in Switzerland; it is considered a defined benefit plan and accounted for in accordance with ASC 715 Compensation - Retirement Benefits. This model allocates pension costs over the service period of employees in the plan. The underlying principle is that employees render services ratably over this period, and therefore, the statement of comprehensive loss effects of pensions should follow a similar pattern. ASC 715 requires recognition of the funded status, or difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of the pension plan on the balance sheet, by recording a corresponding expense in the net loss. If the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, then that difference or unfunded status represents the pension liability.&nbsp;The Company records a net periodic pension cost in the statement of comprehensive loss. The liabilities and annual income or expense of the pension plan is determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long-term rate of asset return (based on the market-related value of assets). The fair values of plan assets are determined based on prevailing market prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -  CONTINUED&nbsp;Related parties&nbsp;Parties are considered to be related if one party directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the other party, if it has an interest in the other party that gives significant influence over the party, if it has joint control over the party, or if it is an associate or a joint venture. Senior management of the Company or close family members is also deemed to be related parties.&nbsp;Earnings per Share&nbsp;Basic earnings per share are calculated using the Company&#146;s weighted-average outstanding common shares. When the effects are not anti-dilutive, diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average outstanding common shares and the dilutive effect of warrants and stock options, if any, as determined under the treasury stock method.&nbsp;Fair Value of Financial Instruments&nbsp;The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables from related parties, bank liabilities, accounts payable to third or related parties, note payables to third or related parties and bonds. The fair value of these financial instruments approximate their carrying value due to the short maturities of these instruments, unless otherwise explicitly noted.&nbsp;ASC 820Fair Value Measurementsestablishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.&nbsp;Stock-based compensation&nbsp;Stock-based compensation costs are recognized in earnings using the fair value based method for all awards granted. Compensation costs for unvested stock options and awards are recognized in earnings over the requisite service period based on the fair value of those options and awards. For employees, fair value is estimated at the grant date and for non-employees fair value is re-measured at each reporting date as required by ASC 718Compensation-Stock Compensation, and ASC 505-50Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Fair values of awards granted under the share option plans are estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model&#146;s input assumptions are determined based on available internal and external data sources. The risk-free rate used in the model is based on the US treasury rate for the expected contractual term. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of a peer group of similar companies in the same industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED3.&nbsp;New accounting standards &#150; adopted&nbsp;In June 2014, the FASB Accounting Standards Update 2014-10,Income Taxes Topic 915: Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements,Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.The amendments in this update eliminated the concept of a development stage entity (&#147;DSE&#148;) from US GAAP. This change rescinds financial reporting requirements that have historically applied to DSEs such as labeling financial statements as those of a DSE, providing inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash-flows and shareholder equity and certain specific disclosures. This ASU has been early adopted by the Company as of April 1, 2014 and therefore for the year ended December 31, 2014. Early adoption is permitted for all financial statements that have not been issued or made available for issuance.."

S"Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased\rwith a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Net Loss per Share Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the\rweighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by Financial Accounting Standards, ASC Topic 260, &#34;Earnings\rper Share&#34;. Basic earnings per common share (&#147;EPS&#148;) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the\rweighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are\rdetermined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding.\rDuring periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting\rprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\rthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements\rand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those\restimates. Management believes that the estimates used are reasonable. In Management's opinion all adjustments necessary for a fair statement\rof the results for the interim periods have been made. All adjustments are normal and recurring. Reclassifications Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to\rthe current year presentation. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue on an accrual basis. Revenue is generally\rrealized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists between\rthe Company and our customer(s); 2) services have been rendered; 3) our price to our customer is fixed or determinable; and 4)\rcollectability is reasonably assured. Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents and accrued expenses approximates\rfair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Stock-based compensation The Company recognizes stock-based compensation in accordance with\rASC Topic 718 &#147;Stock Compensation&#148;, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all\rshare-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related\rto an Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on the estimated fair values. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company has evaluated all of the recent accounting pronouncements\rthrough the filing date of these financial statements and feels that none of them will have a material effect on the Company&#146;s\rinterim financial statements."

S'2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESspacespaceThe following are significant accounting policies in addition to those included in other notes to the consolidated financial statements.spaceUse of Estimates in Financial StatementsspaceThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.spaceRevenue RecognitionspaceSales of equipment and service parts are recorded when the sales price is determinable and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to independent parties based on the sales agreements in effect. In the U.S. and most international locations, this transfer occurs primarily when goods are shipped. In Canada and some other international locations, certain goods are shipped to dealers on a consignment basis under which the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the dealer. Accordingly, in these locations, sales are not recorded until a retail customer has purchased the goods. In all cases, when a sale is recorded by the company, no significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchaser&#8217;s obligation to pay. No right of return exists on sales of equipment. Service parts and certain attachments returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized.The company makes appropriate provisions based on experience for costs such as doubtful receivables, sales incentives and product warranty.spaceFinancing revenue is recorded over the lives of related receivables using the interest method. Insurance premiums recorded in other income are generally recognized in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. Deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are recognized as a reduction in finance revenue over the expected lives of the receivables using the interest method. Income and deferred costs on the origination of operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms in finance revenue.spaceSales IncentivesspaceAt the time a sale is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when a dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on historical data, announced incentive programs, field inventory levels and retail sales volumes.spaceProduct WarrantiesspaceAt the time a sale is recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs. These costs are usually estimated based on historical warranty claims (see Note 22).spaceSales TaxesspaceThe company collects and remits taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the company and its customers. These taxes may include sales, use, value-added and some excise taxes. The company reports the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues).spaceShipping and Handling CostsspaceShipping and handling costs related to the sales of the company&#8217;s equipment are included in cost of sales.spaceAdvertising CostsspaceAdvertising costs are charged to expense as incurred. This expense was $174 million in 2014, $183 million in 2013 and $177 million in 2012.spaceDepreciation and AmortizationspaceProperty and equipment, capitalized software and other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. These assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. Equipment on operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised products, increased capacity and the replacement or major renewal of significant items are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred.spaceSecuritization of ReceivablesspaceCertain financing receivables are periodically transferred to special purpose entities (SPEs) in securitization transactions (see Note 13). These securitizations qualify as collateral for secured borrowings and no gains or losses are recognized at the time of securitization. The receivables remain on the balance sheet and are classified as &#8220;Financing receivables securitized - net.&#8221; The company recognizes finance income over the lives of these receivables using the interest method.spaceReceivables and AllowancesspaceAll financing and trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses, and any deferred fees or costs on originated financing receivables. Allowances for credit losses are maintained in amounts considered to be appropriate in relation to the receivables outstanding based on collection experience, economic conditions and credit risk quality. Receivables are written-off to the allowance when the account is considered uncollectible.spaceImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsspaceThe company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets (including property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) when events or circumstances warrant such a review. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually at the end of the third fiscal quarter each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below the carrying value. Goodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by reporting units, which consist primarily of the operating segments and certain other reporting units. The goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill or long-lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset (see Note 5).spaceDerivative Financial InstrumentsspaceIt is the company&#8217;s policy that derivative transactions are executed only to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The company&#8217;s financial services manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies.spaceAll derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Cash collateral received or paid is not offset against the derivative fair values on the balance sheet. Each derivative is designated as either a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or remains undesignated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the income statement when the effects of the item being hedged are recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as fair value hedges are recognized currently in net income. These changes are offset in net income to the extent the hedge was effective by fair value changes related to the risk being hedged on the hedged item.Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges are recognized currently in the income statement. All ineffective changes in derivative fair values are recognized currently in net income.spaceAll designated hedges are formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, or the hedge designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, the hedge accounting discussed above is discontinued (see Note 27).spaceForeign Currency TranslationspaceThe functional currencies for most of the company&#8217;s foreign operations are their respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the end of the period exchange rates. The revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or losses from these translations are recorded in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved and foreign exchange forward contracts are included in net income. The pretax net losses for foreign exchange in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $47 million, $26 million and $96 million, respectively.'

S'Basis of Presentation and Principles of ConsolidationRaven Industries, Inc. (the Company or Raven) is a diversified technology company providing a variety of products to customers within the industrial, agricultural, energy, construction, and military/aerospace markets.  The Company conducts this business through the following direct and indirect subsidiaries: Aerostar International, Inc. (Aerostar); Vista Research, Inc. (Vista); Raven International Holding Company BV (Raven Holdings); Raven Industries Canada, Inc. (Raven Canada); SBG Innovatie BV; Navtronics BVBA; Raven Industries GmbH (Raven GmbH); Raven Industries Australia Pty Ltd (Raven Australia) and Raven Do Brazil Participacoes E Servicos Technicos LTDA (Raven Brazil).  The Company and these subsidiaries comprisethreeunique operating units, or divisions, classified into reportable segments (Applied Technology, Engineered Films, and Aerostar).The consolidated financial statements for the periods included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned or controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Noncontrolling InterestNoncontrolling interests represent capital contributions, income and loss attributable to the owners of less than wholly-owned and consolidated entities.  The Company owns75%of a business venture to pursue potential product and support services contracts for agencies and instrumentalities of the United States government.  The business venture, Aerostar Integrated Systems (AIS), is included in the Aerostar business segment.Nocapital contributions were made by the noncontrolling interest since the initial capitalization in fiscal year2012.  Given the Company\'s majority ownership interest, the accounts of the business venture have been consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a noncontrolling interest has been recorded for the noncontrolling investor\'s interests in the net assets and operations of the business venture.Investments in AffiliateAn affiliate investment over which the Company has significant influence, but neither a controlling interest nor a majority interest in the risks or rewards of the investee, is accounted for using the equity method.  The investment balance is included in &#8220;Other assets, net,&#8221; while the Company\'s share of the investee\'s results of operations is included in &#8220;Other income (expense), net.&#8221;  The Company considers whether the value of any of its equity method investments has been impaired whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable.  If the Company considered any such decline to be other than temporary (based on various factors, including historical financial results, product development activities and the overall health of the affiliate\'s industry), an impairment loss would be recorded.Use of EstimatesPreparing the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions.  These affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.Foreign CurrencyThe Company\'s subsidiaries that operate outside the United States use the local currency as their functional currency.  The functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using the period-end exchange rates and average exchange rates for the statement of income and comprehensive income.  Adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as foreign currency translation adjustments in &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&#8221; within shareholders\' equity. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recognized in the period incurred and are included in &#8220;Other income (expense), net&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses on intercompany notes receivable and notes payable denominated in foreign currencies for which settlement is not planned in the foreseeable future are considered part the net investment and are reported in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three or fewer months to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalent balances are principally concentrated in checking, money market and savings accounts.  Certificates of deposit that mature in over 90 days but less than one year are considered short-term investments.  Certificates of deposit that mature in one year or more are considered to be other long-term assets and carried at cost.Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, do not bear interest and are considered past due based on invoice terms.  Unbilled receivables arise when revenues have been earned, but not billed, and are related to differences in timing.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company\'s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses.  This is based on historical write-off experience by segment and an estimate of the collectability of any known problem accounts.Inventory ValuationInventories are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on the first-in, first-out basis.   Market value encompasses consideration of all business factors including price, contract terms, and usefulness.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment held for use is carried at the asset\'s cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets primarily using accelerated  methods.  The estimated useful lives used for computing depreciation are as follows:The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense in the period incurred, and renewals and betterments are capitalized.  The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or disposed are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.The Company capitalizes certain internal costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal-use software in accordance with the accounting guidance for such costs.  These capitalized software costs totaled$0in fiscal2015,$203in fiscal2014and$7in fiscal2013.  The costs are included in &#8220;Property, plant and equipment, net&#8221; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Software costs that do not meet capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred.  Amortization expense related to capitalized software is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated lives ranging from3to5years and is included in depreciation.Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is defined as an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company uses the established fair value hierarchy, which classifies or prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  These classifications include:Level 1- Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;Level 2- Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; andLevel 3- Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore, requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.The Company\'s financial assets required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.  The Company determines fair value of its cash equivalents and short-term investments through quoted market prices.The Company\'s goodwill and long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These valuations are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are not observable.  Our accounting policy and methodology for assessing impairment of these assets is further described below and in theCritical Accounting Estimatessection of the Management\'s Discussion and Analysis in Part 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Form 10-K).For all acquisitions, the Company is required to measure the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, excluding goodwill and deferred income taxes. In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of the acquisition date, and subsequently at the end of each reporting period.  These valuations are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are not observable.  Fair value measurements associated with acquisitions, including acquisition-related contingent liabilities, are described in Note 5Acquisition of and Investments in Businesses and Technologies.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets, primarily comprised of technologies acquired through acquisition, are recorded at cost and are presented net of accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed either on a straight-line basis or under the undiscounted cash flows methodover the estimated useful lives ranging from3to20years. The straight-line method of amortization is used when it reflects an appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to earnings in each reporting period.GoodwillThe Company recognizes goodwill as the excess cost of an acquired business over the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Earn-out payments are accrued at fair value as of the purchase date and payments reduce the accrual without affecting goodwill. Any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration after the acquisition date is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever a triggering event indicates there may be an impairment. Impairment tests of goodwill are performed at the reporting unit level.  A qualitative impairment assessment over relevant events and circumstances may be assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If events and circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the fair values are estimated based on discounted cash flows and are compared with the corresponding carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the amount of the impairment loss must be measured and then recognized to the extent the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value.Long-Lived AssetsThe Company periodically assesses the recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the assets. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.Long-lived assets determined to be held for sale and classified as such in accordance with the applicable guidance are reported as long-term assets at the lower of  the asset\'s carrying amount or fair value less the estimated cost to sell.  Depreciation is not recorded once a long-lived asset has been classified as held for sale.Insurance ObligationsThe Company utilizes insurance policies to cover workers\' compensation and general liability costs.  Liabilities are accrued related to claims filed and estimates for claims incurred but not reported.  To the extent these obligations are expected to be reimbursed by insurance, the probable insurance policy benefit is included as a component of &#8220;Other current assets.&#8221;ContingenciesThe Company is involved as a defendant in lawsuits, claims, regulatory inquiries, or disputes arising in the normal course of business.  An estimate of the loss on these matters is charged to operations when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  While the settlement of any claims cannot be determined, management believes that any liability resulting from these claims will be substantially covered by insurance.  Accordingly, management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a significant impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and has been earned.  Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and shipment or delivery has occurred (depending on the terms of the sale).   The Company sells directly to customers or distributors who incur the expense and commitment for any post-sale obligations beyond stated warranty terms.  Estimated returns, sales allowances or warranty charges are recognized upon shipment of a product.For certain service-related contracts, the Company recognizes revenue under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, whereby contract revenues are recognized on a pro-rata basis based upon the ratio of costs incurred compared to total estimated contract costs.  Contract costs include labor, material, subcontracting costs, as well as allocation of indirect costs.  Revenues including estimated profits are recorded as costs are incurred.  Losses estimated to be incurred upon completion of contracts are charged to operations when they become known.Certain contracts contain provisions for incentive payments that the Company may receive based on performance criteria related to product design, development and production standards.  Revenue related to the incentive payments is recognized when ultimate realization by the Company is assured, which generally occurs when the provisions and performance criteria required by the contract are met.Operating ExpensesThe primary types of operating expenses are classified in the income statement as follows:The Company\'s gross margins may not be comparable to industry peers due to variability in the classification of these expenses across the industries in which the Company operates.WarrantiesAccruals necessary for product warranties are estimated based on historical warranty costs and average time elapsed between purchases and returns for each division. Additional accruals are made for any significant, discrete warranty issues.Share-Based CompensationThe Company records compensation expense related to its share-based compensation plans using the fair value method.  Under this method, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined as of the grant date and the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests.Income TaxesDeferred income taxes reflect future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting basis of the Company\'s assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods when the temporary differences will affect taxable income.  When necessary, deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect realizable value.  Accruals are maintained for uncertain tax positions.Accounting PronouncementsAccounting Standards AdoptedThere were no accounting standards adopted or effective in fiscal year 2015 that were of significance, or potential significance, to the Company.Pending Accounting StandardsIn January 2015 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01, "Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items" (ASU 2015-01).  The amendments in ASU 2015-01 eliminate the GAAP concept of extraordinary items and no longer requires that transactions that met the criteria for classification as extraordinary items be separately classified and reported in the financial statements.  ASU 2015-01 retains the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently and expands them to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring.  ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.  The amendments may be applied prospectively or retrospectively to all prior periods presented.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.In August 2014 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern" (ASU 2014-15). The amendments in ASU 2014-15 require management to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards.  ASU 2014-15 requires certain financial statement disclosures when there is "substantial doubt about the entity\'s ability to continue as a going concern" within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).  ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures.In June 2014 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, &#8220;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period" (ASU 2014-12).  ASU 2014-12 affects entities that grant their employees stock-based payments in which terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition and specifies that a reporting entity should apply existing guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards.  ASU 2014-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not believe the guidance applies to any awards that have been granted under the Company\'s share-based compensation plan.  Accordingly, the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, &#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#8221; (ASU 2014-09).   ASU 2014-09 provides a comprehensive new recognition model that requires recognition of revenue when a company transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  This guidance supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, &#8220;Revenue Recognition,&#8221; and most industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. It also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts.  This guidance will be effective for the Company for fiscal 2018 and interim periods therein.  The guidance may be applied using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures).  Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position and results of operations.In April 2014 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, "Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity" (ASU No. 2014-08).  ASU No. 2014-8 changes the criteria for determining which disposals should be presented as discontinued operations and modifies the related disclosure requirements.  Additionally, the new guidance requires that a business that qualifies as held for sale upon acquisition should be reported as discontinued operations.  The new guidance is effective for the Company on February 1, 2015 and applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale after the effective date.  The Company does not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In January 2014 the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-05,  "Service Concession Arrangements" (ASU No. 2014-05).  ASU No. 2014-05 specifies that an operating entity entering into a service concession arrangement with a public-sector entity grantor within the scope of this guidance should not account for such arrangement as a lease in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 840,  "Leases."  This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.'

S"Key Technology, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) design, manufacture, sell and service process automation systems that integrate electro-optical inspection and sorting systems with process systems that include specialized conveying and product preparation equipment.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Key Technology, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries:  Key Technology Holdings USA LLC; Productos Key Mexicana S. de R. L. de C.V.; Key Technology (Shanghai) Trading Co. Ltd.; Key Technology Asia-Pacific Pte. Ltd.; and Key Technology Australia Pty Ltd.  Suplusco Holding B.V. is a wholly-owned European subsidiary of Key Technology Holdings USA LLC that includes the accounts of Key Technology B.V.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Revenue Recognition-The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, the sale price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.  Additionally, the Company sells its goods on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location, typically shipping point, port of loading or port of discharge, depending on the final destination of the goods.  Accordingly, revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all criteria are met, including transfer of title and risk of loss, which occurs either upon shipment by the Company or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale.  Sales of system upgrades are recognized as revenue upon completion of the conversion of the customer's existing system when this conversion occurs at the customer site.  Revenue earned from services (maintenance, installation support, and repairs) is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are performed.  If any contract provides for both equipment and services (multiple deliverables), the sales price is allocated to the various elements based on the relative selling price.  Each element is then evaluated for revenue recognition based on the previously described criteria.  The Company typically has a very limited number of contracts with multiple deliverables and they are not material to the financial statements.  The Company's sales arrangements provide for no other significant post-shipment obligations.  If all conditions of revenue recognition are not met, the Company defers revenue recognition.  In the event of revenue deferral, the sale value is not recorded as revenue to the Company, accounts receivable are reduced by any related amounts owed by the customer, and the cost of the goods or services deferred is carried in inventory.  In addition, the Company periodically evaluates whether an allowance for sales returns is necessary.  Historically, the Company has experienced few sales returns.  If the Company believes there are potential sales returns, the Company would provide any necessary provision against sales.  The Company accounts for cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that are given to customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless an identified benefit is received for which fair value can be reasonably estimated.  Upon receipt of an order, the Company generally receives a deposit which is recorded as customers' deposits.  The Company makes periodic evaluations of the creditworthiness of its customers and generally does not require collateral.  An allowance for credit losses is provided based upon historical experience and anticipated losses.  The Company records revenues net of any taxes, such as sales tax, which are passed through to the customer. Cash andCashEquivalents-The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.  Accounts at each institution regularly exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance coverage.  The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.  Inventoriesare stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Property, Plant and Equipmentare recorded at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives on the straight-line basis, and depreciation commences at the time assets are placed in service.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of useful life or the term of the applicable lease using the straight-line method.  The range of useful lives for fixed assets is as follows:Goodwill and Other Intangibles-The Company has only one reporting unit, and the estimated fair value of the Company approximates the market capitalization of the Company.  The Company performed its annual assessment on July 31, 2011 and determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill due to the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding its carrying amount by a significant margin.  The fair value of the Company was calculated based on the market capitalization of the Company as of July 31, 2011. Other intangibles, which consist of patents, developed technologies, trademarks and trade names, and customer related intangible assets, are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are 10 years for the majority of the assets.  Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of other intangibles based upon current and anticipated results of operations and undiscounted future cash flows.  Amortization of other intangibles was $15,000, $930,000, and $1,270,000 for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively (see Note 2). Product Warranties-The Company provides a warranty on its products ranging from ninety days to five years following the date of shipment, the majority of which are for periods of one year or less.  Management establishes allowances for warranty costs based upon the types of products shipped and product warranty experience.  The provision for warranty costs is charged to cost of sales at the time of sale, and it is periodically assessed for adequacy based on changes in these factors. A reconciliation of the changes in the Company's allowances for warranties is as follows (in thousands): Deferred Income Taxes-Deferred income taxes are provided for the effects of temporary differences arising from differences in the reporting of revenues and expenses for financial statement and for income tax purposes under the asset and liability method using currently enacted tax rates. Research and Development-Expenditures for research and development are expensed when incurred. Foreign Currency Translation-Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.  Translation adjustments are shown as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Revenues, costs, and expenses are translated using an average rate.  Realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the consolidated statement of operations. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets-The Company regularly reviews all of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  If the total of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets, an impairment loss, if any, based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets, is recorded. Estimates-The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. Termination Costs-During fiscal 2011, the Company announced a restructuring of its global operations.  As a result, the Company expects to incur approximately $1.1 million in costs related to the reduction in force, the majority of which relates to one-time termination benefits.  Approximately $700,000 and $400,000 of these costs were expensed as operating expenses and cost of goods sold, respectively, in fiscal 2011.  At September 30, 2011 approximately $1.1 million remained accrued as liabilities for amounts expensed in fiscal 2011 that were not paid as of September 30, 2011.  The Company expects that all of these amounts will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Financial Instruments-The carrying value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued payroll liabilities and commissions, accrued customer support and warranty costs, and other accrued liabilities approximates their estimated fair values due to the short maturities of those instruments. Derivative Financial Instruments-The Company recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The Company enters into such instruments only with financial institutions of good standing, and the total credit exposure related to non-performance by those institutions is not material to the operations of the Company. Earnings Per Share-Basic earnings (loss) per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;) is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average common stock and common stock equivalent shares outstanding during each period using the treasury stock method for employee stock option plans and service-based stock awards.  The calculation of the basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations is as follows (in thousands except per share data):  The weighted average number of diluted shares does not include potential common shares which are anti-dilutive.  The following potential common shares were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as they were anti-dilutive: The options expire on dates beginning in February 2012 through February 2015.  The restrictions on stock grants may lapse between October 2011 and July 2014. Comprehensive Income (loss)-Comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and unrealized gains and losses related to changes in value of an interest rate swap agreement, a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge. The components of accumulated comprehensive income (loss) were as follows (in thousands): Share-Based Compensation-The Company measures the cost of share-based payments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  The cost is recognized as expense over the requisite service period required in exchange for the award.  No compensation cost is recognized for awards where the requisite service period is not completed.  For awards with a performance condition, compensation cost is only recognized if the performance condition is probable of being achieved. Accounting for Income Taxes-The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements-Effective October 1, 2010, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2009-13, &#8220;Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables&#8221; and ASU 2009-14, &#8220;Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software.&#8221;  These ASUs revise and clarify accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables, including how to separate deliverables into units of accounting determining the allocation of revenue to the units of accounting and the application of these provisions to tangible products containing software components.  There are also expanded disclosure requirements for significant judgments made in the application of these standards, if material.  The adoption of these pronouncements did not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted- In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2011-08, &#8220;Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.&#8221;  This standards update amends the goodwill impairment testing standard to allow an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount for purposes of determining whether it is even necessary to perform the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test.  This pronouncement is effective December 15, 2011 and earlier application is permitted.  The Company adopted this pronouncement effective at the beginning of its 2012 fiscal year.  The Company does not expect that adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant effect on its financial statements."

S'SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBASIS OF PRESENTATION &#8212;The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively the &#8220;Company&#8221;) which require consolidation, after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to December 31. There were52weeks in the fiscal year2015, 53 weeks in the fiscal year2014and 52 weeks in the fiscal year2013.During the first quarter of 2015, the Company combined the Construction &amp; Do-It-Yourself ("CDIY") business with certain complementary elements of the Industrial and Automotive Repair ("IAR") and Healthcare businesses (formerly part of the Industrial and Security segments, respectively) to form one Tools &amp; Storage business.  The Company recast segment net sales and profit for all years presented to align with this change in organizational structure.  There was no impact to the consolidated financial statements of the Company as a result of this change.During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company classified the Security segment&#8217;s Spain and Italy operations as held for sale based on management\'s intention to sell these businesses. In July 2015, the Company completed the sale of these businesses. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company classifiedtwosmall businesses within the Security and Industrial segments as held for sale based on management\'s intention to sell these businesses.  These businesses were sold in 2014.  In December 2012, the Company sold its Hardware &amp; Home Improvement business ("HHI"), including the residential portion of Tong Lung Metal Industry Co. ("Tong Lung"), to Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. ("Spectrum") for approximately$1.4 billionin cash.  The purchase and sale agreement stipulated that the sale occur in a First and Second Closing.  The First Closing, which excluded the residential portion of the Tong Lung business, occurred on December 17, 2012 and resulted in an after-tax gain of$358.9 million.  The Second Closing, in which the residential portion of the Tong Lung business was sold for$93.5 millionin cash, occurred on April 8, 2013 and resulted in an after-tax gain of$4.7 million.  The operating results of the above businesses have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The consolidated balance sheet as of January 3, 2015 aggregates amounts associated with discontinued operations as described above.  Refer toNote T, Discontinued Operations,for further discussion.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. While management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from these estimates.  Certain amounts reported in the previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation.FOREIGN CURRENCY &#8212;For foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates, while income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reported in a separate component of shareowners&#8217; equity and exchange gains and losses on transactions are included in earnings.CASH EQUIVALENTS &#8212;Highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.ACCOUNTS AND FINANCING RECEIVABLE &#8212;Trade receivables are stated at gross invoice amounts less discounts, other allowances and provisions for uncollectible accounts. Financing receivables are initially recorded at fair value, less impairments or provisions for credit losses. Interest income earned from financing receivables that are not delinquent is recorded on the effective interest method. The Company considers any financing receivable that has not been collected within 90 days of original billing date as past-due or delinquent. Additionally, the Company considers the credit quality of all past-due or delinquent financing receivables as nonperforming.ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS &#8212;The Company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts using two methods. First, a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations. Second, a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories. These percentages are based on historical collection and write-off experience. Actual write-offs are charged against the allowance when collection efforts have been unsuccessful.INVENTORIES &#8212;U.S. inventories are predominantly valued at the lower of Last-In First-Out (&#8220;LIFO&#8221;) cost or market because the Company believes it results in better matching of costs and revenues. Other inventories are valued at the lower of First-In, First-Out (&#8220;FIFO&#8221;) cost or market because LIFO is not permitted for statutory reporting outside the U.S. SeeNote C, Inventories, for a quantification of the LIFO impact on inventory valuation.PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT &#8212;The Company generally values property, plant and equipment (&#8220;PP&amp;E&#8221;), including capitalized software, at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs related to maintenance and repairs which do not prolong the asset\'s useful life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease.The Company reports depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses based on the nature of the underlying assets. Depreciation and amortization related to the production of inventory and delivery of services are recorded in cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization related to distribution center activities, selling and support functions are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses.The Company assesses its long-lived assets for impairment when indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable are present. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are generated (&#8220;asset group&#8221;) and estimates the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with, and expected to be generated from, the use of and eventual disposition of the asset group. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss must be determined and the asset group is written down to fair value. The impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated fair value, which is determined using weighted-average discounted cash flows that consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the asset group.GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS &#8212;Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired are recorded at estimated fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually during the third quarter, and at any time when events suggest an impairment more likely than not has occurred. To assess goodwill for impairment, the Company, depending on relevant facts and circumstances, performs either a qualitative assessment, as permitted by ASU 2011-08, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment," or a quantitative analysis utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation model.In performing a qualitative assessment, the Company first assesses relevant factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.  The Company identifies and considers the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit. These factors include external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. The Company also assesses changes in each reporting unit\'s fair value and carrying amount since the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed.  In performing a quantitative analysis, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using management&#8217;s assumptions about future cash flows based on long-range strategic plans. This approach incorporates many assumptions including discount rates, future growth rates and expected profitability.  In the event the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill.Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amounts to the current fair market values, usually determined by the estimated cost to lease the assets from third parties. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally using an accelerated method. Under this accelerated method, intangible assets are amortized reflecting the pattern over which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. Definite-lived intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are present. If the carrying amount exceeds the total undiscounted future cash flows, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset were to exceed the fair value, it would be written down to fair value.  No significant goodwill or other intangible asset impairments were recorded during 2015, 2014 or 2013, with the exception of the goodwill and intangible assets related to the Security segment\'s Spain &amp; Italy operations, which were classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2014 and subsequently sold in 2015.  Refer toNote T, Discontinued Operations,for further discussion.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS &#8212;Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including foreign currency, interest rate exposures and commodity prices and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, foreign currency options, commodity contracts and foreign exchange contracts, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in shareowners&#8217; equity as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument is undesignated or qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it represents a fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedge. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings in the same caption as the changes in the fair value of the hedged items. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.In the event it becomes probable the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates will not occur, the derivative would be terminated and the amount in other comprehensive income would generally be recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net investment in foreign operations, to the extent they are effective, are reported in other comprehensive income and are deferred until the subsidiary is sold. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges under ASC 815, &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging&#8221;, including any portion that is considered ineffective, are reported in earnings in the same caption where the hedged items are recognized. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges under ASC 815 are reported in earnings in Other-net.  Refer toNote I, Derivative Financial Instruments,for further discussion.The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.REVENUE RECOGNITION &#8212;General: The majority of the Company&#8217;s revenues result from the sale of tangible products, where revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete, collectability is reasonably assured, and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment of the finished product, but sometimes is upon delivery to customer facilities.Provisions for customer volume rebates, product returns, discounts and allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is an identifiable benefit and evidence of the fair value of the advertising, in which case the expense is classified as Selling, general, and administrative expense.Multiple Element Arrangements: Approximatelyseven percentof the Company&#8217;s revenues are generated from multiple element arrangements, primarily in the Security segment. When a sales agreement involves multiple elements, deliverables are separately identified and consideration is allocated based on their relative selling price in accordance with ASC 605-25, &#8220;Revenue Recognition &#8212; Multiple-Element Arrangements.&#8221;Sales of security monitoring systems may have multiple elements, including equipment, installation and monitoring services. For these arrangements, the Company assesses its revenue arrangements to determine the appropriate units of accounting, with each deliverable provided under the arrangement considered a separate unit of accounting. Amounts assigned to each unit of accounting are based on an allocation of total arrangement consideration using a hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (&#8220;VSOE&#8221;) if available, Third Party Evidence (&#8220;TPE&#8221;) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Revenue recognized for equipment and installation is limited to the lesser of their allocated amounts under the estimated selling price hierarchy or the non-contingent up-front consideration received at the time of installation, since collection of future amounts under the arrangement with the customer is contingent upon the delivery of monitoring services.The Company&#8217;s contract sales for the installation of security intruder systems and other construction-related projects are recorded under the percentage-of-completion method.  Profits recognized on security contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related total cost of the project at completion. The extent of progress toward completion is generally measured using input methods based on labor metrics. Revisions to these estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. For certain short duration and less complex installation contracts, revenue is recognized upon contract completion and customer acceptance. The revenues for monitoring and monitoring-related services are recognized as services are rendered over the contractual period.Customer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are rendered. The associated deferred revenue is included in Accrued expenses or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate.COST OF SALES AND SELLING, GENERAL &amp; ADMINISTRATIVE &#8212;Cost of sales includes the cost of products and services provided reflecting costs of manufacturing and preparing the product for sale. These costs include expenses to acquire and manufacture products to the point that they are allocable to be sold to customers and costs to perform services pertaining to service revenues (e.g. installation of security systems, automatic doors, and security monitoring costs). Cost of sales is primarily comprised of inbound freight, direct materials, direct labor as well as overhead which includes indirect labor and facility and equipment costs. Cost of sales also includes quality control, procurement and material receiving costs as well as internal transfer costs. SG&amp;A costs include the cost of selling products as well as administrative function costs. These expenses generally represent the cost of selling and distributing the products once they are available for sale and primarily include salaries and commissions of the Company&#8217;s sales force, distribution costs, notably salaries and facility costs, as well as administrative expenses for certain support functions and related overhead.ADVERTISING COSTS &#8212;Television advertising is expensed the first time the advertisement airs, whereas other advertising is expensed as incurred. Advertising costs are classified in SG&amp;A and amounted to$101.7 millionin2015,$121.5 millionin2014, and$121.1 millionin2013. Expense pertaining to cooperative advertising with customers reported as a reduction of Net Sales was$211.9 millionin2015,$206.5 millionin2014, and$172.4 millionin2013. Cooperative advertising with customers classified as SG&amp;A expense amounted to$6.4 millionin2015,$6.2 millionin2014, and$6.0 millionin2013.SALES TAXES &#8212;Sales and value added taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from Net Sales reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS &#8212;The Company generally does not bill customers for freight. Shipping and handling costs associated with inbound freight are reported in Cost of sales. Shipping costs associated with outbound freight are reported as a reduction of Net Sales and amounted to$183.0 million,$226.2 million, and$201.6 millionin2015,2014, and2013, respectively. Distribution costs are classified as SG&amp;A and amounted to$229.3 million,$243.2 millionand$229.5 millionin2015,2014and2013, respectively.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION &#8212;Compensation cost relating to stock-based compensation grants is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generallyfouryears. The expense for stock options and restricted stock units awarded to retirement eligible employees (those aged55and over, and with10or more years of service) is recognized on the grant date, or (if later) by the date they become retirement-eligible.POSTRETIREMENT DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN &#8212;The Company uses the corridor approach to determine expense recognition for each defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan. The corridor approach defers actuarial gains and losses resulting from variances between actual and expected results (based on economic estimates or actuarial assumptions) and amortizes them over future periods. For pension plans, these unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. For other postretirement benefits, amortization occurs when the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. For ongoing, active plans, the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period for active plan participants. For plans with primarily inactive participants, the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants.INCOME TAXES &#8212;The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes", which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Any changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized.  In making this determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing temporary differences, estimates of future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and the realizability of net operating loss carry forwards.  In the event that it is determined that an asset is not more likely that not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded against the asset. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels.  In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made.  Conversely, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period that the determination was made.The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which requires a two-step process. First, management determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and second, for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxing authority.  The Company maintains an accounting policy of recording interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of Income taxes on continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company is subject to income tax in a number of locations, including many state and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required when calculating the worldwide provision for income taxes. Many factors are considered when evaluating and estimating the Company\'s tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the Company\'s unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters. The Company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information, which involves inherent uncertainty.EARNINGS PER SHARE &#8212;Basic earnings per share equals net earnings attributable to Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc., less earnings allocated to restricted stock units with non-forfeitable dividend rights (if applicable), divided by weighted-average shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share include the impact of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method when the effect is dilutive.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS &#8212;In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-01, &#8220;Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10):  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.&#8221;  The main objective of this update is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information.  The new guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, &#8220;Income Taxes (Topic 740):  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.&#8221;   The objective of this update is to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position.  The amendments in this update do not affect the current requirement to offset deferred tax assets and liabilities for each tax-paying component within a tax jurisdiction.  This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, &#8220;Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.&#8221;  This update requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The ASU requires that the acquirer record, in the financial statements of the period in which adjustments to provisional amounts are determined, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This ASU is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30):  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line of Credit Arrangements."  This ASU provides additional guidance to ASU 2015-03, discussed further below, which did not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. ASU 2015-15 noted that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330):  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory." This ASU changes the measurement principle for certain inventory methods from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  This ASU does not apply to inventory that is measured using Last-in First-out ("LIFO") or the retail inventory method.  The provisions of ASU 2015-11 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-04, "Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Subtopic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer\'s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets."  This update provides a practical expedient that permits a company to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end date that is closest to the company\'s fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient consistently from year to year.  The practical expedient should be applied consistently to all plans if the company has more than one plan.  This ASU is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard in 2015 and it did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs."  The new standard requires that all costs incurred to issue debt be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount.  The standard also indicates that debt issuance costs do not meet the definition of an asset because they provide no future economic benefit.  This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  The new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis.  The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2016 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis." The new standard amends the consolidation guidance in ASC 810 and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under current generally accepted accounting principles. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this new guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, "Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items," which eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items stating that the concept causes uncertainty because it is unclear when an item should be considered both unusual and infrequent and that users do not find the classification and presentation necessary to identify those events and transactions. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted provided the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not expect this standard to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern," which requires management of a company to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.  This ASU is effective for the annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not expect this standard to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)."  The new revenue recognition standard outlines a comprehensive model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.  The new model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.  The core principle of the new guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In July 2015, the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date of the standard to annual reporting periods (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities are permitted to apply the new revenue standard early, but not before the original effective date of annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard shall be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements.In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, "Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360):  Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity."  The amendments contained in this update change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhance the reporting requirements for discontinued operations.  Under the revised standard, a discontinued operation must represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity\'s operations and financial results. Examples could include a disposal of a major line of business, a major geographical area, a major equity method investment, or other major parts of an entity.  The revised standard will also allow an entity to have certain continuing cash flows or involvement with the component after the disposal.  Additionally, the standard requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. This ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 with early adoption permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as held for sale) that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issue.  The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2015.'

S'Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.&#xA0;Restricted CashRestricted cash was used solely to fund the research and development efforts under the High Risk Plaque Initiative Program (HRP) (Note 15). The Company has reported the changes in restricted cash as an operating activity in the statements of cash flows as a result of the Company receiving cash in prepayment of planned expenditures that was restricted for funding HRP expenses. At December&#xA0;31, 2013, the HRP initiative had met its goals and all funding from the participating companies had been applied to initiative expenses, with no restricted cash remaining.Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Allowances for doubtful accounts are provided for those outstanding balances considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and management&#x2019;s evaluation of the outstanding balances at year end. Bad debts, if any, are written off against the allowance when identified and offset by recoveries when received.Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant CustomersFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution that management believes to be of high quality, which balance exceeds federally insured limits throughout the year. To reduce credit risk associated with accounts receivable, the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, as a consequence, believes that accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. The Company does not require collateral from its customers.The Company has one customer which generated 73%, 80% and 74% of its product revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. That same customer represented 87% and 78% of its accounts receivable at December&#xA0;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Concentration of Supplier RiskThe Company obtains materials included in its BGM Galectin-3 Test from a small group of suppliers. The Company carries significant strategic inventories of these materials to reduce the risk associated with this small group of suppliers. Strategic inventories are managed based on demand. To date, the Company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of the materials used in the production of its products in a timely manner from existing sources.InventoryInventory is stated at the lower of cost or market.&#xA0;Costs are determined under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventories consisted of the following at December&#xA0;31:&#xA0;Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met: (i)&#xA0;persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii)&#xA0;delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed; (iii)&#xA0;the seller&#x2019;s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and (iv)&#xA0;collectability is reasonably assured.&#xA0;RevenuesWe recognize four classes of revenues. Product revenues are comprised of payments made to us from the sale of our products to laboratory testing services, hospitals and clinics and diagnostic testing distributors. Partnership and product fee revenues are comprised of payments made to us by our automated partners in consideration for the rights and licenses granted by us to our automated partners. Service revenues have historically been generated through initiatives, collaborations and biomarker discovery and analysis service agreements.Product RevenuesThe Company sells its products through supply agreements with laboratory testing services and diagnostic testing distributors and directly to hospitals and clinics. The Company recognizes revenue when products are received by customers, at which time both title and risk of loss have passed to the customers. The Company negotiates credit terms on a customer-by-customer basis and products are shipped at an&#xA0;agreed-upon&#xA0;price.Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. Freight costs billed to customers are recorded as revenue.The Company does not currently provide a reserve for sales returns as returns are only allowed for defects in workmanship. Allowances for doubtful accounts are provided for those outstanding balances considered to be uncollectible based upon historical experience and management&#x2019;s evaluation of the outstanding balances at year end.Partnership RevenuesPartnership revenues are comprised of payments made to us by our automated partners in consideration for modifications made to our license and distribution agreements or in consideration for achievement of specified commercial milestones. These payments are non-refundable and not to be applied against future product fees owed to us. In the case of contract modifications, we recognize revenue upon receipt of the payments or deferred over an appropriate period based on the nature of the underlying contract changes. We recognize revenue in consideration for achievement of specified commercial milestones as the milestones are met or exceeded.Partnership revenue increased in 2015 to $21,000, from $0 in 2014. The increase relates to a $500,000 payment made to us upon execution of the fourth amendment to our agreement with Abbott, which occurred in November 2015. The amendment was principally in regard to the product fees paid to us by Abbott for galectin-3 tests sold by Abbott to reference laboratories, while retaining the previously negotiated product fee for the other customer segments. This payment has been recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized over 24 months beginning in December 2015.Product Fee RevenuesThe Company recognizes product fee revenue when it receives quarterly test sales reporting and payments thereunder from its partners. The Company has entered into worldwide license, development and commercialization agreements with Abbott, bioM&#xE9;rieux SA, (&#x201C;bioM&#xE9;rieux&#x201D;), Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., (&#x201C;Siemens&#x201D;), and Alere Inc., (&#x201C;Alere&#x201D;). As consideration for the rights and licenses granted by the Company to its partners, the licensees pay to the Company a product fee, as set forth in the respective agreements, for tests sold to third parties. To date, only Abbott and bioM&#xE9;rieux have paid product fees to the Company.&#xA0;Service RevenuesService revenues are primarily attributable to the activities from the HRP initiative, for which all revenue has been recorded as of December&#xA0;31, 2013. The Company did not record service revenues in 2014 or 2015 and does not expect to record service revenues in 2016 or beyond.The Company&#x2019;s revenue has historically been generated through initiatives, collaborations and biomarker discovery and analysis services agreements. The services the Company provides under these agreements typically include the integrated analysis of preclinical and/or clinical samples to identify biomarkers related to disease mechanisms. In some cases, the Company has retained certain intellectual property rights to the biomarkers identified in the course of these arrangements. The revenue arrangements have a stated term and the Company has no obligations or ongoing commitments after the specified term of the arrangement.Revenue generated from collaborations and initiatives, such as the HRP initiative described in Note 15, includes revenue from research services and technology licensing agreements. Under these arrangements, the Company is contractually obligated to provide research services and project oversight and administration. The rights to the results of the research, including any intellectual property developed, are licensed to all the members of the collaboration at the inception of the arrangement. The Company has accounted for all deliverables, which include the research services, oversight and administration and the rights to the intellectual property developed, as a single unit of accounting as there is no stand-alone value to the individual elements. The Company considers the terms and conditions of each agreement and recognizes revenues based upon a proportional performance methodology. This methodology involves recognizing revenue over the term of the agreement, as underlying research costs are incurred, and measured on the basis of input measures such as labor or instrument hours expended. The Company believes that these input measures approximate the output measures as the costs incurred are directly proportional to the services that are being provided. The Company makes adjustments, if necessary, to the estimates used in its calculations as work progresses and as such changes are known. The principal costs under these agreements are for personnel and instrumentation expenses to conduct research and development but also include costs for materials and other direct and indirect items necessary to complete the research under these agreements. Actual results may vary from the Company&#x2019;s estimates.Payments received on uncompleted long-term contracts may be greater than incurred costs and estimated earnings and have been recorded as deferred revenues and classified as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Product Fee ReclassificationBeginning in the third quarter of 2015, the Company began disclosing product fee revenue separately from product revenue. To maintain comparability, all previously reported product revenue figures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to break out the product fee revenue recognized during those periods. Management evaluated the amount and nature of the change and concluded that it was not material to either the previously reported annual or quarterly financial statement results of operations. Nonetheless, the Company has reclassified the historical statements of operations amounts included in this filing as follows (in thousands):&#xA0;&#xA0;Product and Product Fee CostsProduct and product fee costs consist of contract-manufacturing for the BGM Galectin-3 Test, freight, and revenue-based royalty expenses for certain galectin-3 in-licensed intellectual property. In 2013, the Company became subject to excise taxes due to the classification of the galectin-3 test as a taxable medical device. The excise tax is included in product costs.Service CostsService costs consist primarily of expenses incurred in connection with the collaborative research and development agreements and biomarker discovery and analysis services agreements. Expenses include outside services and internal personnel costs, laboratory consumables, license fees and overhead expenses related to providing these services. The majority of the cost of service revenue in the periods presented was incurred in connection with the HRP initiative discussed in Note 15.Research and Development CostsResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments, if any, for goods and services used in research and development are recognized as expenses as the related goods are delivered or services are performed. Research and development costs include labor, materials and supplies and overhead.Intangible Assets and Long Lived AssetsThe only intangible asset recognized at December&#xA0;31, 2015 and 2014 relates to the cost of completed technology acquired for use in connection with the Company&#x2019;s development of the galectin-3 test and certain other technologies. The assigned life is 10 years, which contemplates a three to five year phase of development of the diagnostic test followed by the expected commercial life of the test. Amortization of this asset has been recorded within research and development expense for all periods presented.The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets, including intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and fair value.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the grant-date fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes compensation expense only for those stock-based awards expected to vest after considering expected forfeitures. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award. Stock compensation costs have not been capitalized by the Company.The Company accounts for stock-based awards issued to non-employees by recognizing compensation expense based on the fair value of such awards when the services are completed over the vesting period of the award.Income TaxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the impact of temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured under enacted tax laws. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.&#xA0;The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes tax benefits when a position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of income tax expense.Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common StockholdersBasic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The Company applied the two-class method to calculate its basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock, as its convertible preferred stock, common stock, and warrants to purchase common stock are participating securities. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that otherwise would have been available to common stockholders. However, the two-class method does not impact the net loss per share of common stock as the Company was in a loss position for each of the periods presented, and neither preferred stockholders nor warrant holders participate in losses.The following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December&#xA0;31:&#xA0;The following potential common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because they had an antidilutive impact due to the losses reported:&#xA0;&#xA0;SegmentsOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker (&#x201C;CODM&#x201D;) in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The Company&#x2019;s chief executive officer is the CODM, and he uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company has determined that it operates in one segment. All of the Company&#x2019;s assets are located in the United States and substantially all of the Company&#x2019;s revenues are from customers in the United States.New Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, &#x201C;Leases,&#x201D; which changes financial reporting around leasing transactions and more closely aligns accounting for leases with the recently issued International Financial Reporting Standard. Among other things, the update requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for operating leases and changes many key definitions, including the definition of a lease. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, &#x201C;Financial Instruments &#x2013; Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities&#x201D;, which provides new guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, &#x201C;Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory&#x201D;. The update replaces the concept of &#x201C;lower of cost or market&#x201D; with that of &#x201C;lower of cost and net realizable value&#x201D;, which requires companies to measure certain inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2016, and interim periods within those years on a prospective basis. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows and does not expect the impact to be material.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, &#x201C;Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs&#x201D;. This ASU, which is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2015, requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Early adoption is permitted and retrospective application is required. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#x2019;s results of operations or financial condition.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&#xA0;2014-09, &#x201C;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#x201D;, which supersedes existing accounting standards for revenue recognition and creates a single framework. This standard provides principles for recognizing revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers with the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and specifies the accounting for certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. On July&#xA0;9, 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of this new accounting guidance by one year, which will result in it being effective for annual periods beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures, as well as the available transition methods.&#xA0;ReclassificationsCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to the current year presentation. The reclassifications did not have any effect of reported net income/(loss) for any period presented.'

S'NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of PresentationThe Company&#8217;s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;).The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control, and preventing and detecting fraud. Our system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that: (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) valid transactions are recorded; and (3) transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements that present fairly our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the respective periods being presented. Liquidity and Dependency of Related PartiesAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $15,458. The Company&#8217;s cash used in operating cash flows was $199,812 and $136,132 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As discussed in Note 3, one of our Chairman and a Significant Shareholder has funded the Company with related party loans which have been all converted to common stock. Similarly, the Company plans to use the financial resources of its related parties in the future.  Despite the fact that the related parties has confirmed in writing the intention to provide financial support, the Company does not have any binding agreements now or in the past with the related parties obligating them to fund the future debt or any other obligations.  The related parties is not otherwise under any legal obligation to provide the Company with capital. If the related parties withdraws his financial support to enable the company to fund its current activities, management will be required to reduce the Company&#8217;s cash from operations by reducing operating costs. In addition, the Company is working to manage its current liabilities while it continues to make changes in operations to further improve its cash flow and liquidity position. Based upon current cash flow projections, management believes the Company will have sufficient capital resources to meet projected cash flow requirements through the next twelve months. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of credit riskFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash deposits and customer receivables.  The Company maintains cash with various major financial institutions.  The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these institutions.  To reduce risk, the Company performs credit evaluations of its customers and maintains reserves for potential credit losses.  Cash and cash equivalentsWe consider all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Revenue and cost recognitionThe Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition.  The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.  The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is accounted for gross as a principal versus net as an agent. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis since our company has the risks and rewards of ownership, latitude in selection of vendors and pricing, and bears all credit risk. The Company recognizes revenue on its Omni Commerce Solution licensing when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Costs are recorded at the time the related revenue is recorded. Payment processing costs are recorded in the period the costs are incurred and customer acquisition costs are comprised primarily of telemarketing costs and service costs and other additional benefit services. Membership FeesThe Company recognizes revenues from membership fees for the sales of health-related discount benefit plans as earned as part of the ShopFast program. These arrangements are generally renewable monthly and revenue is recognized over the renewal period.  As these products often include elements sold through contracts with third-party providers, the Company considers each contractual arrangement in accordance with the Revenue Recognition topic of the FASB ASC 605. The Company&#8217;s current contracts meet these requirements for reporting revenue on a gross basis. The Company records a reduction in revenue for refunds, chargeback&#8217;s from credit card companies, and allowances based upon actual history and management&#8217;s evaluation of current facts and circumstances. Stock-based CompensationWe account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees (&#8220;ASC 505-50&#8221;). ASC 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract. We account for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation&#8212;Stock Compensation, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered. Net Loss per ShareNet income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section ASC 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period.  The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. The Company&#8217;s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect due to the Company generating a loss. Fair value of financial instrumentsThe Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;Paragraph 820-10-35-37&#8221;) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:  The carrying amount of the Company&#8217;s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.  The Company&#8217;s notes payable approximates the fair value of such instruments based upon management&#8217;s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the Company for similar financial arrangements at December 31, 2015. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Income TaxesWe follow ASC 740-10-30, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. We adopted ASC 740-10-25 (&#8220;ASC 740-10-25&#8221;) with regard to uncertainty income taxes.  ASC 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.  Under ASC 740-10-25, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740-10-25 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.  We had no material adjustments to our liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of ASC 740-10-25. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update &#8220;ASU&#8221; 2014-15 on &#8220;Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#8217;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#8221;. Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management&#8217;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management&#8217;s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#8217;s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). The amendments in this Update are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has reviewed other recently issued accounting pronouncements and plans to adopt those that are applicable to it. The Company does not expect the adoption of any other pronouncements to have an impact on its results of operations or financial position.'

S'Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2014, FASB\rissued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) No. 2014-09, &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&#148;  The\rupdate gives entities a single comprehensive model to use in reporting information about the amount and timing of revenue resulting\rfrom contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The proposed ASU, which would apply to any entity that enters into contracts\rto provide goods or services, would supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605 &#34;Revenue Recognition,&#34;\rand most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. Additionally, the update would supersede\rsome cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35 &#34;Revenue Recognition &#150; Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.&#34;\rThe update removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements and provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue\rissues and more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. In addition, the\rupdate improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets\rand simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. The\rupdate is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual\rreporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. All other entities may apply the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 earlier as of\ran annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.\rAll other entities also may apply the guidance in Update 2014-09 earlier as of an annual reporting period beginning after December\r15, 2016, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning one year after the annual reporting period in\rwhich the entity first applies the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine\rif there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In June 2014, the\rFASB issued ASU 2014-12, &#34;Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms\rof an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period.&#34; This ASU provides\rmore explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting\rand that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective for annual\rand interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material\rimpact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2014,\rthe FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern,&#148; which requires\rmanagement to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial\rdoubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are\rissued and provide related disclosures.  ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and\rinterim periods thereafter.  Early application is permitted.  The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material\reffect on the condensed consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, FASB\rissued ASU No. 2015-11, &#147;Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory&#148; more closely align\rthe measurement of inventory in GAAP with the measurement of inventory in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  The\ramendments in this ASU do not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method.\rThe amendments apply to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average\rcost. An entity should measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable\rvalue is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal,\rand transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. For\rpublic business entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within\rthose fiscal years. For all other entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim\rperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively with\rearlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently reviewing\rthe provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We are currently reviewing\rthe provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.'

S'(2)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;ACCOUNTING POLICIES&#xA0;The Company is an exploration stage company and the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in connection with the preparation of the financial statements.&#xA0;&#xA0;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure on contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.&#xA0;The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the US dollar.&#xA0;&#xA0;The consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Company and the entities it controlled at the end of the financial period and the results of the Company and the entities it controlled during the year. Where entities are not controlled throughout the entire financial year, the consolidated results include the results of those entities for that part of the period during which control exists. The effect of all transactions between entities in the group and the inter-entity balances are eliminated in full in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Company has only one controlled entity.&#xA0;&#xA0;Aurum considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.&#xA0;&#xA0;For the periods presented there were no cash equivalents.&#xA0;&#xA0;The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to ASC Topic 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes.&#xA0;&#xA0;The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. For the period presented, there was no taxable income. There are no deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences in reporting certain income and expense items for income tax and financial accounting purposes. Aurum at this time is not aware of any net operating losses which are expected to be realised.&#xA0;&#xA0;The Company is an Australian resident corporation under Australian law and accordingly is subject to Australian income tax on its non-exempt worldwide assessable income (which includes capital gains), less allowable deductions, at the rate of 30%. Foreign tax credits are allowed where tax has been paid on foreign source income, provided the tax credit does not exceed 30% of the foreign source income.&#xA0;Under the U.S. Australia tax treaty, a U.S. resident corporation such as Aurum is subject to Australian income tax on net profits attributable to the carrying on of a business in Australia through a &#x201C;permanent establishment&#x201D; in Australia. A &#x201C;permanent establishment&#x201D; is a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is carried on. The treaty limits the Australian tax on interest and royalties paid by an Australian business to a U.S. resident to 10% of the gross interest or royalty income unless it relates to a permanent establishment. Although we consider that we do not have a permanent establishment in Australia, the Company may be deemed to have such an establishment due to the location of its administrative offices in Melbourne. In addition we may receive interest or dividends from time to time.&#xA0;&#xA0;The Company calculates loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, &#x201C;Earnings per Share&#x201D;.&#xA0;Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net profit (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.&#xA0;Diluted loss per share has not been presented as all the common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive (see Note 12).&#xA0;&#xA0;FASB ASC Topic 825, &#x201C;Financial Instruments&#x201D;, requires the Company to disclose, when reasonably attainable, the fair market values of its assets and liabilities which are deemed to be financial instruments.&#xA0;&#xA0;Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Where necessary, comparative figures have been restated to be consistent with current year presentation.&#xA0;&#xA0;Mineral property acquisition, exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred until such time as economic reserves are quantified.&#xA0;&#xA0;To date, the Company has not established any proven or&#xA0;&#xA0;probable&#xA0;&#xA0;reserves on its mineral properties. When it is determined that a mining deposit can be economically and legally extracted or produced based on established proven and probable reserves, further exploration costs and development costs incurred after such determination will be capitalized. The establishment of proven and probable reserves is based on results of final feasibility studies which indicate whether a property is economically feasible. Upon commencement of commercial production, capitalized costs will be transferred to the appropriate asset category and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Capitalized costs, net of salvage values, relating to a deposit which is abandoned or considered uneconomic for the foreseeable future, will be written off.'

S'DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"Begin Block Tagged Note 1 - us-gaap:SignificantAccountingPoliciesTextBlockXBRL,nsxbrl,nx  Polaris Industries Inc. (&#8220;Polaris&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) a Minnesota corporation, and its subsidiaries, are engaged in the design, engineering, manufacturing and marketing of innovative, high-quality, high-performance off-road vehicles snowmobiles, and on-road vehicles including motorcycles and low emission vehicles. Polaris products, together with related parts, garments and accessories are sold worldwide through a network of dealers, distributors and its subsidiaries located in the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Spain, China and Brazil. Basis of presentation:The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Polaris and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Income from financial services is reported as a component of operating income to better reflect income from ongoing operations of which financial services has a significant impact. In 2004, the Company announced its decision to discontinue the manufacture of marine products effective immediately. The marine products division&#8217;s financial results are reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company evaluates consolidation of entities under Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 810. This Topic requires management to evaluate whether an entity or interest is a variable interest entity and whether the company is the primary beneficiary. Polaris used the guidelines to analyze the Company&#8217;s relationships, including the relationship with Polaris Acceptance, and concluded that there were no variable interest entities requiring consolidation by the Company in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Fair Value Measurements:ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This Topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 &#8212; Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 &#8212; Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 &#8212; Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its non-qualified deferred compensation assets, and the income approach for the interest rate swap agreements, foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities and for the income approach the Company uses significant other observable inputs to value its derivative instruments used to hedge interest rate volatility, foreign currency and commodity transactions. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):   Investment in Finance Affiliate:The caption Investment in finance affiliate in the consolidated balance sheets represents Polaris&#8217; 50 percent equity interest in Polaris Acceptance, a partnership agreement between GE Commercial Distribution Finance Corporation (&#8220;GECDF&#8221;) and one of Polaris&#8217; wholly-owned subsidiaries. Polaris Acceptance provides floor plan financing to Polaris dealers in the United States. Polaris&#8217; investment in Polaris Acceptance is accounted for under the equity method, and is recorded as investments in finance affiliate in the consolidated balance sheets. Polaris&#8217; allocable share of the income of Polaris Acceptance and the Securitized Receivables has been included as a component of income from financial services in the consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 6 for additional information regarding Polaris&#8217; investment in Polaris Acceptance. Investment in Manufacturing Affiliates:The caption Investments in manufacturing affiliates in the consolidated balance sheets represents Polaris&#8217; equity investment in Robin Manufacturing, U.S.A. (&#8220;Robin&#8221;), which builds engines in the United States for recreational and industrial products and Polaris&#8217; equity investment in KTM prior to the sale of that investment. At December 31, 2010, Polaris had a 40 percent ownership interest in Robin. Fuji and Polaris have agreed to close the Robin facility by mid-2011 as the production volume of engines made at the facility has declined significantly in recent years. In the third quarter of 2010, the Company sold its remaining equity investment in the Austrian motorcycle company, KTM Power Sports AG (&#8220;KTM&#8221;) which manufactures off-road and on-road motorcycles, for $9,601,000 and recorded a net gain on securities available for sale of $1,594,000. Prior to the sale of the KTM investment, the Company owned less than 5 percent of KTM&#8217;s outstanding shares. The KTM investment, prior to the sale, had been classified as available for sale securities under ASC Topic 320. During the second quarter 2010, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of the KTM shares owned by the Company as of June 30, 2010 was other than temporary and therefore recorded in the statement of income a non-cash impairment charge on securities held for sale of $769,000. During the first quarter 2009, the Company determined that the decline in the fair value of the KTM shares owned by the Company as of March 31, 2009 was other than temporary and therefore recorded in the statement of income a non-cash impairment charge on securities held for sale of $8,952,000.XBRL Pagebreak BeginEND PAGE WIDTHPAGEBREAKBEGIN PAGE WIDTHXBRL Pagebreak End Use of estimates:The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Ultimate results could differ from those estimates. Cash equivalents:Polaris considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Such investments consist principally of commercial paper and money market mutual funds. Allowance for doubtful accounts:Polaris&#8217; financial exposure to collection of accounts receivable is limited due to its agreements with certain finance companies. For receivables not serviced through these finance companies, the Company provides a reserve for doubtful accounts based on historical rates and trends. This reserve is adjusted periodically as information about specific accounts becomes available. Inventories:Inventories are stated at the lower of cost(first-in,first-out method) or market. The major components of inventories are as follows (in thousands):  Property and equipment:Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the respective assets, ranging from10-40 yearsfor buildings and improvements and from 1-7 years for equipment and tooling. Fully depreciated tooling is eliminated from the accounting records annually. Goodwill and other intangible assets:ASC Topic 350 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Topic 350 requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually. An impairment charge is recognized only when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than its carrying amount. The Company performed analyses as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The results of the analyses indicated that no goodwill or intangible impairment existed. In accordance with Topic 350, the Company will continue to complete an impairment analysis on an annual basis. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows (in thousands): XBRL Pagebreak BeginEND PAGE WIDTHPAGEBREAKBEGIN PAGE WIDTHXBRL Pagebreak End Other intangibles consist of the following (in thousands):  Amortized intangible assets totaled $2,959,000 at December 31, 2010 and consisted of product technology acquired during 2010. Gross amounts and related accumulated amortization amounts include adjustments related to the impact of foreign currency translation and changes in the fair value of net assets. Aggregate amortization expense for intangibles was $188,000, $0 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The weighted average amortization period for the existing technology is seven years. Estimated amortization expense for each of the years 2011 to 2015 is expected to be $450,000 per year. The preceding expected amortization expenses is an estimate and actual amounts could differ due to additional intangible asset acquisitions, changes in foreign currency rates or impairment of intangible assets. Research and Development Expenses:Polaris records research and development expenses in the period in which they are incurred as a component of operating expenses. In the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 Polaris incurred $84,940,000, $62,999,000, and $77,472,000, respectively. Advertising Expenses:Polaris records advertising expenses as a component of selling and marketing expenses in the period in which they are incurred. In the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 Polaris incurred $40,833,000, $37,433,000 and $51,193,000, respectively. Shipping and Handling Costs:Polaris records shipping and handling costs as a component of cost of sales at the time the product is shipped. Product warranties:Polaris provides a limited warranty for its off-road vehicles for a period of six months and for a period of one year for its snowmobiles and motorcycles. Polaris may provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs, as well as longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions. Polaris&#8217; standard warranties require the Company or its dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. The warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor based on management&#8217;s best estimate using historical rates and trends. Adjustments to the warranty reserve are made from time to time as actual claims become known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Factors that could have an impact on the warranty accrual in any given year include the following: improved manufacturing quality, shifts in product mix, changes in warranty coverage periods, snowfall and its impact on snowmobile usage, product recalls and any significant changes in sales volume. The activity in the warranty reserve during the years presented is as follows (in thousands):  Sales promotions and incentives:Polaris provides for estimated sales promotion and incentive expenses, which are recognized as a reduction to sales, at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor. Examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include dealer and consumer rebates, volume incentives, retail financing programs and sales associate incentives. Sales promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current programs and historical rates for each product line. Actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if the customer usage rate varies from historical trends. Polaris recorded accrued liabilities of $75,494,000 and $67,055,000 related to various sales promotions and incentive programs as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Historically, sales promotion and incentive expenses have been within the Company&#8217;s expectations and differences have not been material. Dealer holdback programs:Polaris provides dealer incentive programs whereby at the time of shipment Polaris withholds an amount from the dealer until ultimate retail sale of the product. Polaris records these amounts as a reduction of revenue and a liability on the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid. Payments are generally made to dealers twice each year, in the first quarter and the third quarter, subject to previously established criteria. Polaris recorded accrued liabilities of $79,688,000 and $72,229,000, for dealer holdback programs in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Foreign currency translation:The functional currency for each of the Polaris foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities in all Polaris foreign entities are translated at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Translation gains and losses are reflected as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders&#8217; equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Revenues and expenses in all of Polaris&#8217; foreign entities are translated at the average foreign exchange rate in effect for each month of the quarter. The net Accumulated other comprehensive income related to translation gains and losses was a net gain of $6,991,000 and $3,861,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenue recognition:Revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to the dealer or distributor or other customers. Product returns, whether in the normal course of business or resulting from repossession under its customer financing program (see Note 3), have not been material. Polaris withholds an amount from the dealer for incentive programs and provides for estimated sales promotion expenses which are recognized as reductions to sales when products are sold to the dealer or distributor customer. Share-based employee compensation:For purposes of determining estimated fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant under ASC Topic 718, Polaris uses the Black-Scholes Model. The Black-Scholes Model requires the input of certain assumptions that require judgment. Because employee stock options and restricted stock awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options or restricted stock awards. Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share-based compensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact the fair value determination. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of Topic 718 in future periods, the compensation expense that was recorded under Topic 718 may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period. Refer to Note 2 for additional information regarding share-based compensation. The Company estimates the likelihood and the rate of achievement for performance sensitive share-based awards, specifically long-term compensation grants of Long Term Incentive Plan (&#8220;LTIP&#8221;) and restricted stock. Changes in the estimated rate of achievement can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation expenses as the effect of a change in the estimated achievement level is recognized in the period that the likelihood factor changes. If adjustments in the estimated rate of achievement are made, they would be reflected in our gross margin and operating expenses. Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities:ASC Topic 815 requires that changes in the derivative&#8217;s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met, and requires that a company must formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. The net unrealized loss of the derivative instruments of $1,256,000 at December 31, 2010 and the net unrealized gain of $2,436,000 at December 31, 2009 were recorded in the accompanying balance sheets as other current assets or other current liabilities. Polaris&#8217; derivative instruments consist of the interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange and commodity contracts discussed below. The after tax unrealized losses of $1,093,000 and $655,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were recorded as components of Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company&#8217;s diesel fuel contracts in 2010 and 2009, and aluminum contracts in 2010 and 2009 did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting and therefore, the resulting unrealized gains from those contracts are included in the consolidated statements of income in Cost of sales. The unrealized gains for the diesel fuel contracts for 2010 and 2009 totaled $282,000 and 212,000, respectively, pretax, and the unrealized gains for the aluminum contracts for 2010 and 2009 totaled $607,000 and $3,273,000, respectively, pretax. Interest rate swap agreements:At December 31, 2010, Polaris had two interest rate swaps on a combined $50,000,000 of borrowings which expires in April 2011. Each of these interest rate swaps were designated as and met the criteria as cash flow hedges. The fair value of these swap agreements were calculated by comparing the fixed rate on the agreement to the market rate of financial instruments similar in nature. The fair values of the swaps on December 31, 2010 and 2009 were unrealized losses of $126,000 and $699,000, respectively, which were recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from these agreements are recorded in interest expense when realized. Unrealized gains or losses, after tax, are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Shareholders&#8217; Equity. Foreign exchange contracts:Polaris enters into foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exposures of certain of its purchase commitments denominated in foreign currencies and transfers of funds from time to time from its foreign subsidiaries. Polaris does not use any financial contracts for trading purposes. These contracts met the criteria for cash flow hedges. Gains and losses on the Canadian dollar, Norwegian Krone, Swedish Krona, and Australian dollar contracts at settlement are recorded in Nonoperating other expense (income). Gains and losses on the Japanese yen contracts at settlement are recorded in Cost of sales. Unrealized gains or losses, after tax, are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Shareholders&#8217; Equity. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a net liability of $2,019,000 as of December 31, 2010 and a net liability of $350,000 as of December 31, 2009. Commodity derivative contracts:Polaris is subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel, aluminum, fuel, and petroleum-based resins. In addition, the Company purchases components and parts containing various commodities, including steel, aluminum, rubber and others which are integrated into the Company&#8217;s end products. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. The Company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process. From time to time, Polaris utilizes derivative contracts to hedge a portion of the exposure to commodity risks. During 2010 and 2009, the Company entered into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of the exposure for diesel fuel and aluminum. These contracts did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting and the resulting unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of sales. The fair value of the commodity derivative contracts was a net asset of $889,000 as of December 31, 2010 and a net asset of $3,485,000 as of December 31, 2009. Comprehensive income:Components of comprehensive income include net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, and unrealized gains or losses on securities held for sale, net of tax. The Company has chosen to disclose comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated statements of shareholders&#8217; equity and comprehensive income. New accounting pronouncements: Improving Disclosure about Fair Value Measurements:In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;)2010-06,&#8220;Improving Disclosure about Fair Value Measurements.&#8221; ASU2010-06revises two disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements and clarifies two others. It requires separate presentation of significant transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosure of the reasons for such transfers. It also requires the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements within Level 3 on a gross basis rather than a net basis. The amendments also clarify that disclosures should be disaggregated by class of asset or liability and that disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques should be provided for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for certain Level 3 activity disclosure requirements that will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. We have included the additional disclosure required by ASU2010-06in its footnotes beginning with the 2010 first quarter. Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets:In December 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 860, &#8220;Transfers and Servicing: Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets.&#8221; This Topic amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for Statement 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140). ASC Topic 860 provides guidance on how to account for transfers of financial assets including establishing conditions for reporting transfers of a portion of a financial asset as opposed to an entire asset and requires enhanced disclosures about a transferor&#8217;s continuing involvement with transfers. The impact of adoption of this topic was not material to us. Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities:In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU2009-17,&#8220;Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities&#8221;, which amends ASC Topic 810, &#8220;Consolidation&#8221; (FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)). ASU2009-17requires the enterprise to qualitatively assess if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable-interest entity (VIE), and, if so, the VIE must be consolidated. The ASU also requires additional disclosures about an enterprise&#8217;s involvement in a VIE. ASU2009-17was effective for us beginning with our quarter ended March 31, 2010. The impact of adopting the new guidance was not material to us.'

S'Principles\rof Consolidation&#150; The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. All significant\rintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use\rof Estimates&#150; The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that management\rmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets\rand liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\rreporting period. Management periodically assesses the accuracy of these estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ\rfrom those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for various items, including but not limited to allowances for doubtful\raccounts; net realizable value of inventory, derivative financial instruments; asset impairments; revenue recognition; depreciation\rand amortization; and other contingencies. Cash\rand Cash Equivalents -Cash balances in banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation subject to certain\rlimitations.  For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity\rof three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Restricted\rCash- At June 30, 2014 and 2013, the Company had $72 and $0, respectively of restricted cash that was maintained at a blocked\rbank account created for the purpose of making payments, under agreements on a Promissory Note due to a third party manufacturer\r(see Note 9). Revenue\rRecognition&#150; Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services\rhave been rendered, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue\rwhen product is shipped or when it is received by the customer, depending on the contractual terms. The Company&#146;s revenue\ris comprised of the sale of its products to retailers and distributors. Allowance\rfor Doubtful Accounts&#150; The Company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses\rresulting from the likelihood that customers will fail to make payments. Management determines the estimate of the allowance for\runcollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors, including: (1) historical experience; (2) aging\rof the accounts receivable; and (3) specific information obtained by the Company on the financial condition and the current\rcreditworthiness of its customers. Inventories&#150; Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally by the first-in, first-out method.\rThe costs of finished goods and work-in-process inventories include material, manufacturing labor and overhead components. The\rCompany periodically reviews the net realizable value of the inventory and, if necessary, records a reserve to reflect the net\rrealizable value of the inventory. Property\rand Equipment&#150; Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and\requipment is provided using the straight-line method over the assets&#146; estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are\ramortized over the shorter of the assets&#146; economic lives or the lease term. Intangible\rAssets&#150; Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. For financial reporting purposes, amortization\rof intangibles has been computed over an estimated useful life of seven years using the straight-line method. Amortization expenses\rhave been included in operating expenses. Deferred\rRevenue&#150; Deferred revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected in advance, primarily for future\roil well service, performance and appearance product purchases, and is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until\rthe revenue is earned. Impairment\rof Long-Lived Assets&#150; Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\rthat the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When it becomes apparent that indicators such as a significant\rdecrease in the market value of the long-lived asset group or if material differences between operating results and the Company&#146;s\rforecasted expectations occur, then an impairment analysis is performed. If\rindicators arise, an initial determination of recoverability is performed based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash\rflows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition compared with the carrying value. If the carrying value\rof the asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, a measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets is performed.\rThe impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over the fair value, as determined utilizing appropriate\rvaluation techniques. Segments&#150; The Company has grouped its long-lived assets in accordance with the methodologies of how it manages the business.\rCurrently, the Company is one segment with multiple products, and as such the Company&#146;s asset group is based upon this one\rsegment methodology. Stock\rBased Compensation&#150; The Company accounts for stock-based awards to recipients in accordance with applicable accounting\rprinciples, which requires compensation expense related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be measured\rand recognized in the financial statements based on a determination of the fair value of the stock options. The grant date fair\rvalue is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton (&#147;Black-Scholes&#148;) pricing model. For all employee stock options,\rthe Company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period (generally, the vesting period of the stock-based\raward). The Company&#146;s option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock\rprice volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate. Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions could significantly impact\rstock-based compensation expense. Advertising\rand Promotional Costs&#150; Advertising and promotion costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expense,\rare expensed as incurred.  During the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, advertising and promotion costs totaled $1,394\rand $2,965 respectively. Shipping\rCosts&#150; Shipping costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. During the years ended June 30,\r2014 and 2013, shipping cost totaled $149 and $349, respectively. Research\rand Development Costs&#150; Research and development costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expense,\rconsist primarily of salaries and employment related expenses, independent testing fees and allocated facility costs. All such\rcosts are charged to expense as incurred.During the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, research\rand development costs totaled $319 and $557, respectively. Net\rLoss Per Share&#150; Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted\rnet loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised.  Dilution\ris computed by applying the treasury stock method.  Under this method, options, warrants and restricted stock are assumed\rto be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used\rto purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Since the Company has incurred losses from all periods\rpresented, the dilutive per share calculation is the same as the basic calculation. Anti-dilutive securities not included in net\rloss per share calculation for the year include:  Income\rTaxes&#150; The Company accounts for income taxes by the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\rfuture tax consequences of temporary differences between the recognition of tax effects for financial statement and income tax\rreporting purposes by applying enacted income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement\rcarrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce net deferred\rtax assets to only that portion that is judged more likely than not to be realized. Fair\rValue Measurements&#150;Accounting standards have been issued which define fair value, establishes a market-based\rframework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard is applicable\rwhenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard\rdoes not expand or require any new fair value measures; however its application may change current practice. Fair\rvalue is defined under the standard as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the\rprincipal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standard\ralso establishes a three-level hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use\rof unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.    The\rCompany&#146;s financial instruments at June 30, 2014 consist of accounts receivable, accounts payable, notes payable and derivative\rliability. The Company believes the reported carrying amounts of its accounts receivable, accounts payable, derivative instruments\rand related party debt approximate fair value, based upon the short-term nature of these instruments.'

S'1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of PresentationGulf Island Fabrication, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the &#x201C;Company&#x201D;, &#x201C;we&#x201D; or &#x201C;our&#x201D;), is a leading fabricator of offshore drilling and production platforms and other specialized structures. The Company&#x2019;s principal corporate office is located in Houston, Texas and its fabrication facilities are located in Houma, Louisiana and San Patricio County, Texas. The Company&#x2019;s principal markets are concentrated in the offshore regions and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Gulf Island Fabrication, Inc. and its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Gulf Island Fabrication, Inc. (&#x201C;Gulf Island&#x201D;) serves as a holding company and conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries, which include Gulf Island, L.L.C. and Gulf Marine Fabricators, L.P. (both of which perform fabrication of offshore drilling and production platforms and other specialized structures used in the development and production of oil and gas reserves), Gulf Island Marine Fabricators, L.L.C. (which performs marine fabrication and construction services), Dolphin Services, L.L.C. (which performs offshore and onshore fabrication and construction services), Dolphin Steel Sales, L.L.C. (which sells steel plate and other steel products) and Gulf Island Resources, L.L.C. (which hires laborers with similar rates and terms as those provided by contract labor service companies).Operating CycleThe lengths of our contracts vary, but are typically longer than one year in duration. Consistent with industry practice, assets and liabilities have been classified as current under the operating cycle concept whereby all contract-related items are regarded as current regardless of whether cash will be received or paid within a twelve month period. Assets and liabilities classified as current which may not be paid or received within the next twelve months include contract retainage, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts. However, any variation from normal contract terms would cause classification of assets and liabilities as long-term.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include asset impairments, value of assets held for sale, provisions for contract losses, contract revenues, costs and profits and the application of the percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe routinely review individual contracts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts as we deem appropriate. Among the factors considered during the review are the financial condition of our customer and their access to financing, underlying disputes on the account, age and amount of the account and overall economic conditions. Accounts are written off only when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.Our principal customers include major and large independent oil and gas companies and their contractors and marine vessel operators and their contractors. This concentration of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Receivables are generally not collateralized. In the normal course of business, we extend credit to our customers on a short-term basis.During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company included an allowance for bad debt in the amount of $3.6 million in connection with negotiations of an outstanding contract receivable balance with a deepwater offshore customer related to a deepwater hull project completed during the first quarter of 2014.At December&#xA0;31, 2013, the Company included an allowance for bad debt in the amount of $0.9 million in connection with a vessel upgrade and outfitting project. The Company collected $0.6 million of this balance as part of the final settlement during the fourth quarter 2014.Stock-Based CompensationAwards under the Company&#x2019;s stock-based compensation plans are calculated using a fair-value based measurement method. Share-based compensation expense for share based awards is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest. We use the straight-line method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the award.InventoryInventory consists of materials and production supplies and is stated at the lower of cost or market determined on the first-in, first-out basis.Assets Held for SaleAssets held for sale are required to be measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Management determined fair value with the assistance of third party valuation specialists, assuming the sale of the underlying assets individually or in aggregate to a willing market participant, including normal ownership risks assumed by the purchaser, and the sale of certain components at scrap value. We estimated fair value relying primarily on the cost approach and applied the market approach where comparable sales transaction information was readily available. The cost approach is based on current replacement and reproduction costs of the subject assets less depreciation attributable to physical, functional, and economic factors. The market approach involves gathering data on sales and offerings of similar assets in order to value the subject assets. This approach also includes the assumption for the measurement of the loss in value from physical, functional, and economic factors. The fair value of the assets held for sale at December&#xA0;31, 2014 represent Level 3 fair value measurements (as defined by GAAP), based primarily on the limited availability of market pricing information for either identical or similar items.Workers Compensation LiabilityThe Company and its subsidiaries are self-insured for workers&#x2019; compensation liability except for losses in excess of varying threshold amounts. Our workers compensation liability balance was $2.7 million and $1.9 million as of December&#xA0;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.&#xA0;Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 25 years. Ordinary maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the physical or economic lives of the plant or equipment, are charged to expense as incurred.Long-Lived AssetsThe Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets or asset groups used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets or asset groups might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows that are estimated to be generated by those assets or asset groups are less than the carrying amounts of those assets or asset groups. The impairment loss is determined by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying amount and recording the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair value as an impairment charge. An asset group constitutes the minimum level for which identifiable cash flows are principally independent of the cash flows of other asset or liability groups. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. Due to the slow down in our industry as a result of the downturn in oil prices, we identified indicators of impairment at our Texas facility. Management performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis during the fourth quarter of 2014 for the Texas facility, which did not result in impairment.Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company bases its fair value determinations of the carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities on an evaluation of their particular facts and circumstances and valuation techniques that require judgments and estimates. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The carrying amounts that we have reported for financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables and accounts payable approximate their fair values. See&#xA0;Note 5-&#x201C;Assets Held for Sale&#x201D; for additional information regarding fair value measurements.Revenue RecognitionThe Company uses the percentage-of-completion accounting method for construction contracts. Revenue from fixed-price or unit rate contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, computed by the efforts-expended method which measures the percentage of labor hours incurred to date as compared to estimated total labor hours for each contract. This progress percentage is applied to estimated gross profit for each contract to determine gross profit earned to date. Revenue recognized in a period for a contract is the amount of gross profit earned for that period plus the costs incurred on the contract during the period.Under a unit rate contract, material items or labor tasks are assigned unit rates of measure. The unit rates of measure will generally be an amount of dollars per ton, per foot, per square foot or per item installed. A typical unit rate contract can contain hundreds to thousands of unit rates of measure. Profit margins are built into the unit rates.Some contracts include a total or partial reimbursement to us of any costs associated with specific capital projects required by the fabrication process. If a particular capital project provides future benefits to us, the cost to build the capital project will be capitalized, and the revenue for the capital project will increase the estimated profit in the contract.Contract costs include all direct material, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies and tools. Also included in contract costs are a portion of those indirect contract costs related to plant capacity, such as depreciation, insurance and repairs and maintenance. These indirect costs are allocated to jobs based on actual direct labor hours incurred. Profit incentives are included in revenue when their realization is probable. Claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenue when the amount can be reliably estimated and collection is probable. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.Some of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if we are responsible for the failure to meet specified contractual milestone dates and the applicable customer asserts a claim under those provisions. Those contracts define the conditions under which our customers may make claims against us for liquidated damages. In 2014, we had one asserted liquidated damages claim in the amount of $0.3 million that was fully settled, related to the fabrication of an offshore supply vessel. Other than the aforementioned claim, of March&#xA0;5, 2015, we were not aware of any asserted liquidated damage claims by any of our customers.At December&#xA0;31, 2014, we had no revenue related to unapproved change orders on projects. At December&#xA0;31, 2013, we recorded revenue totaling $0.1 million related to certain change orders on two projects which had been approved as to scope but not price. At December&#xA0;31, 2013, we recorded revenue totaling $3.7 million related to re-measure units and quantities on a unit rate contract. At December 31, 2012, we recorded revenue totaling $5.2 million related to certain change-orders on four projects which were approved as to scope but not price. At December&#xA0;31, 2012, we recorded revenue totaling $7.7 million related to re-measure units and quantities on a unit rate contract. All matters relating to unapproved items have since been resolved.Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. We recognized contract losses of $6.6 million, $30.8 million, and $12.5 million in the years ended December&#xA0;31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.During the quarter ended September 30, 2013, we entered into discussions with a large deepwater customer concerning our customer&#x2019;s request for a reduction in scope of the project, whereby remaining completion and integration work would be performed at the integration site by a different integration contractor. We transferred the project deliverables to the integration contractor&#x2019;s site and removed from backlog estimated revenue of $25.5 million and estimated labor hours of 271,000 hours representing our previous estimate of remaining work to complete the project during the third quarter of 2013. Throughout the fourth quarter of 2013 and into the first quarter 2014, we continued negotiations with our large deepwater customer with respect to final amounts due to us and to our subcontractors for claims for all work performed prior to transition of the scope of work to the customer-designated replacement contractor. We executed a final change order to this contract with the customer in early March 2014 that provided for a final payment of $11.0 million by our customer that was received during the first half of 2014. We recorded an additional loss provision of $18.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 related to this project. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized estimated contract losses of $29.6 million primarily as a result of our inability to recover certain costs and the de-scoping of this contract.Income TaxesIncome taxes have been provided using the liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to reserve for deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.Reserves for uncertain tax positions are recognized when the positions are more likely than not to not be sustained upon audit. Interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are recorded in income tax expense. Our federal tax returns have been examined and settled through the 2007 tax year. There were no material uncertain tax positions recorded for the years presented in these statements.Accounting StandardsOn May&#xA0;28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, &#x201C;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#x201D; (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 605, &#x201C;Revenue Recognition.&#x201D; ASU No. 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 requires retrospective application and will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December&#xA0;15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is not permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of this new standard on its financial statements.'

S'3. Significant Accounting PoliciesForeign CurrencyThe U.S.&#xA0;dollar is the functional currency for the Company&#x2019;s operations, except for its South African and European operations. The Company determines the functional currency of each subsidiary based on a number of factors, including the predominant currency for revenues, expenditures and borrowings. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recognized in the period incurred and are included in &#x201C;Other income (expense)&#x201D; on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Rand is the functional currency of the Company&#x2019;s South African operations, and the Euro is the functional currency for the Company&#x2019;s European operations. As such, translation adjustments resulting from translating the functional currency financial statements into U.S.&#xA0;dollar equivalents are reflected as a separate component on the Consolidated Statements of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). When the subsidiary&#x2019;s functional currency is the U.S.&#xA0;dollar, such as the Company&#x2019;s Australian operations, adjustments from the remeasurement of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are presented in &#x201C;Other income (expense)&#x201D; on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency transactions that are not expected to be settled in the foreseeable future are reported by the Company in the same manner as translation adjustments.For the year ended December&#xA0;31, 2012, eleven months ended December&#xA0;31, 2011 and year ended December&#xA0;31, 2010, the Company recorded net unrealized and realized foreign currency losses of $8 million, $8 million and $13 million, respectively. For the one month ended January&#xA0;31, 2011, the Company recorded a net unrealized and realized foreign currency gain of $2 million.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December&#xA0;31, 2012 and 2011, total cash and cash equivalents was $716 million and $154 million, respectively, of which $50 million and $62 million, respectively, was held within the United States.Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are reflected at their net realizable values, reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts to allow for expected credit losses. The allowance is estimated by management, based on factors such as age of the related receivables and historical experience, giving consideration to customer profiles. The Company generally does not charge interest on accounts receivable, nor require collateral; however, certain operating agreements have provisions for interest and penalties that may be invoked, if deemed necessary. Accounts receivable are aged in accordance with contract terms and are written off when deemed uncollectible.See Note 6 for additional information regarding accounts receivable.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of actual cost or market, net of allowances for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.&#xA0;The cost of finished goods inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Carrying values include material costs, labor and associated indirect manufacturing expenses. Costs for materials and supplies, excluding ore, are determined by average cost to acquire. Raw materials are carried at actual cost.The Company periodically reviews its inventory for obsolescence or inventory that is no longer marketable for its intended use, and records any write-down equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about alternative uses, market conditions and other factors.See Note 7 for additional information regarding inventories.Property, Plant and Equipment, NetProperty, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, except that costs of replacements or renewals that improve or extend the lives of existing properties are capitalized.&#xA0;Depreciation&#xA0;&#x2014; Property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life by the straight-line method. Useful lives for certain property, plant and equipment are as follows:&#xA0;Retirements and Sales&#xA0;&#x2014; The cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the respective accounts upon retirement or sale of property, plant and equipment. Any resulting gain or loss is included in &#x201C;Cost of goods sold&#x201D; or &#x201C;Selling, general, and administrative expenses&#x201D; on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Interest Capitalized&#xA0;&#x2014; The Company capitalizes interest costs on major projects that require an extended period of time to complete. See Note 12 for additional information regarding capitalized interest.See Note 8 for additional information regarding property, plant and equipment.Mineral Leaseholds, NetThe Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized in accordance with ASC 805,Business Combinations(&#x201C;ASC 805&#x201D;) as tangible assets when management has determined that probable future benefits consisting of a contribution to future cash inflows have been identified and adequate financial resources are available or are expected to be available as required to meet the terms of property acquisition and anticipated exploration and development expenditures. Mineral leaseholds are depreciated over their useful lives as determined under the units of production method.Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to develop such property through the commencement of production are capitalized.See Note 9 for additional information regarding mineral leaseholds.Intangible Assets, NetIntangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. The Company amortizes intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 5 to 20&#xA0;years.See Note 10 for further information related to the Company&#x2019;s intangible assets.Recoverability of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, mineral leaseholds and intangible assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.&#xA0;Under such circumstances, the Company assesses whether the projected undiscounted cash flows of its long-lived assets are sufficient to recover the existing unamortized cost of its long-lived assets.&#xA0;If the undiscounted projected cash flows are not sufficient, the Company calculates the impairment amount by discounting the projected cash flows using its weighted-average cost of capital.&#xA0;The amount of the impairment is written off against earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined.Asset Retirement ObligationsTo the extent a legal obligation exists, an asset retirement obligation (&#x201C;ARO&#x201D;) is recorded at its estimated fair value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. Fair value is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted at the Company&#x2019;s credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. The Company&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements classify accretion expense related to asset retirement obligations as a production cost, which is included in &#x201C;Cost of goods sold&#x201D; on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.See Note 13 for additional information regarding asset retirement obligations.&#xA0;Environmental Remediation and Other ContingenciesIn accordance with ASC 450Contingencies(&#x201C;ASC 450&#x201D;) and ASC 410,Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations(&#x201C;ASC 410&#x201D;), the Company recognizes a loss and records an undiscounted liability when litigation has commenced or a claim or assessment has been asserted, or, based on available information, commencement of litigation or assertion of a claim or assessment is probable, and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of environmental liabilities, which include the cost of investigation and remediation, are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, presently enacted laws and regulations as well as prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. In future periods, a number of factors could change the Company&#x2019;s estimate of environmental remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation or administration or relevant cleanup levels; revisions to the remedial design; unanticipated construction problems; identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soils and groundwater; the availability of information to estimate probable but previously inestimable obligations; and changes in costs of labor, equipment and technology.To the extent costs of investigation and remediation have been incurred and are recoverable from federal, state, or other governmental agencies and have been incurred or are recoverable under certain insurance policies or from other parties and such recoveries are deemed probable, the Company records a receivable for the estimated amounts recoverable (undiscounted). Receivables are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in either &#x201C;Accounts receivable&#x201D; or as a component of &#x201C;Other Long-Term Assets,&#x201D; depending on the estimated timing of collection.Self InsuranceThe Company is self-insured for certain levels of general and vehicle liability, property, workers&#x2019; compensation and health care coverage. The cost of these self-insurance programs is accrued based upon estimated fully developed settlements for known and anticipated claims. Any resulting adjustments to previously recorded reserves are reflected in current operating results. The Company does not accrue for general or unspecific business risks.Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when risk of loss and title to the product is transferred to the customer. All amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to shipping and handling represent revenues earned and are reported as net sales.Cost of Goods SoldCost of goods sold includes the costs of purchasing, manufacturing and distributing products, including raw materials, energy, labor, depreciation and other production costs. Costs incurred by the Company for shipping and handling are reported in &#x201C;Cost of goods sold&#x201D; on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Receiving, distribution, freight and warehousing costs are also included in &#x201C;Cost of goods sold&#x201D; on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs related to marketing, sales, agent commissions, research and development, legal and administrative functions such as human resources, information technology, investor relations, accounting, treasury, and tax compliance. Costs include expenses for salaries and benefits, travel and entertainment, promotional materials and professional fees.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development costs were $9 million, $9 million, less than $1 million and $6&#xA0;million for the year ended December&#xA0;31, 2012, eleven months ended December&#xA0;31, 2011, one month ended January&#xA0;31, 2011 and year ended December&#xA0;31, 2010, respectively, and were expensed as incurred.Pension and Postretirement BenefitsThe Company provides pension and postretirement benefits for qualifying employees worldwide, which are accounted for in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation &#x2014; Retirement Benefits(&#x201C;ASC 715&#x201D;). See Note 20 for additional information regarding pension and postretirement benefits.&#xA0;Share-based CompensationThe Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with ASC&#xA0;718,Compensation-Share-Based Compensation(&#x201C;ASC 718&#x201D;).Liability Restricted Share Awards &#x2014;Certain restricted share awards have been classified as liability awards and were re-measured to fair value at each reporting date.&#xA0;The restricted share awards classified as liabilities contained only a service condition and had graded vesting provisions.Equity Restricted Share Awards&#x2014; The fair value of equity instruments is measured based on the average share price on the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period.&#xA0;The restricted share awards contain service, market and/or performance conditions. For awards containing only a service condition, the Company has elected to recognize compensation costs using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award. For awards containing a market condition, the fair value of the award is measured using the lattice model. For awards containing a performance condition, the fair value of the award is equal to the average share price but compensation expense is not recognized until the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be met. The Company reassesses the probability each quarter.Options &#x2014;The Black-Scholes option pricing model is utilized to measure the fair value of options. Options generally contain only service conditions and have graded vesting provisions. The Company has elected to recognize compensation costs using the straight-line method over the requisite service period for the entire award.See Note 19 for additional information regarding employee share-based compensation.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for taxes in accordance with ASC 740,Income Taxes(&#x201C;ASC 740&#x201D;). The Company has operations in several countries around the world and is subject to income and similar taxes in these countries. The estimation of the amounts of income taxes involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations and how foreign taxes affect domestic taxes, as well as the analysis of the realizability of deferred tax assets, tax audit findings and uncertain tax positions. Although the Company believes its tax accruals are adequate, differences may occur in the future, depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided against a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets and reflects any changes in its estimates in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), as appropriate. ASC&#xA0;740 requires that all available positive and negative evidence be weighted to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recorded.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. The Company&#x2019;s estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon its evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions for which it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company records the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Interest and penalties are accrued as part of tax expense, where applicable. If the Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized.See Note 17 for additional information regarding income taxes.Fair value measurementThe Company accounts for its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC&#xA0;820,Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, (&#x201C;ASC&#xA0;820&#x201D;). In measuring fair value on a recurring basis, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs, to the extent possible, and considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value.The fair value hierarchy specified by ASC 820 is as follows:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, short-term debt and other current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. See Note 12 for information on the fair value of the Company&#x2019;s long-term debt.'

S"Note 2. Summary\rof Significant Accounting Policies The summary of significant\raccounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company&#146;s financial statements. Such financial\rstatements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company&#146;s management, which is responsible for the integrity\rand objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\r(&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;) in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements. Basis of Presentation\rand Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial\rstatements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly subsidiaries Z&#38;W CA and its majority owned subsidiaries JXZD. All\rinter-company transactions and balances were eliminated. The portion of the income applicable to non-controlling interests in subsidiary\rundertakings is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Use of Estimates\rand Assumptions The Company prepares\rits financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\rthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\rstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\restimates. Foreign Currency\rAdjustments Assets and liabilities\rrecorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated\rat average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Any translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of stockholders&#146;\requity (deficit) and have no effect on current earnings. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included\rin current results of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had aggregate\rforeign currency translation gain of $400,600 and $22,664, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers\rall highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable\rare stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses\rresulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining\rthe collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current\reconomic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. Past due balances over 90 days and other higher risk amounts are\rreviewed individually for collectability. If the financial condition of the Company&#146;s customers were to deteriorate, adversely\raffecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Based on management&#146;s assessment, the\rCompany provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance. Balances\rthat remain outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation\rallowance and a credit to accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded allowances of $201,191 and\r$100,042, respectively, for doubtful accounts from certain sales that occurred but had not been collected. Inventories Finished goods, work-in-process,\rand raw materials are valued at the lower of average production cost and net realizable value. The Company records the costs of\rore stacked on its leach pads and in process at its production sites as heap leach ore and working process inventories measured\rat the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value in inventory. These costs are charged to earnings and included in cost\rof revenues on the basis of tons of precious mineral sold. The estimates and assumptions used in the measurement of heap leach\rore and work-in-process inventories include quantities of ore stacked on leach pads, recoverable tons of precious minerals contained\rin ore stacked on leach pads, recoverable tons of precious minerals in the mill processing circuits and the price expected to be\rrealized when the tons of precious minerals are recovered. If these estimates\ror assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the Company could be required to write down the carrying amounts of its heap leach ore and\rwork-in-process inventories, which would reduce the Company&#146;s earnings and working capital. Property and Equipment Property and equipment\ris stated at the historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided using\rthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for both financial and income tax reporting purposes as\rfollows:  Expenditures for normal\rrepairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.  Significant renewals and improvements are capitalized.  The\rcosts and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the accounts, and any\rresulting gain or loss is recognized in the year of disposal. Impairment of Long-Lived\rAssets Management reviews\rlong-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable\ror at a minimum annually during the fourth quarter of the year.  If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted\rcash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset&#146;s carrying value to determine if an impairment of such asset\ris necessary.  The effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset and\rits carrying value. Income Taxes An asset and liability\rapproach is used for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences\rbetween income tax and financial reporting and principally relate to recognition of revenue and expenses in different periods for\rfinancial and tax accounting purposes and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws. In addition, a deferred tax\rasset can be generated by net operating loss carry forwards. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred\rtax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized. The Company has tax losses that may be applied against future\rtaxable income. The potential tax benefit arising from these loss carryforwards are offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainty\rof profitable operations in the future. Fair Values of Financial\rInstruments Management believes\rthat the carrying amounts of the Company&#146;s financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and accounts payable, approximated\rtheir fair values as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, due to their short-term nature. Non-controlling\rInterest Non-controlling interests\rin the Company&#146;s subsidiaries are reported as a component of equity, separate from the parent&#146;s equity. Purchase or\rsale of equity interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Results of operations\rattributable to the minority interest are included in our consolidated results of operations and, upon loss of control, the interest\rsold, as well as interest retained, if any, will be reported at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized\rwhen products are shipped, title and risk of loss is passed to the customers and collection is reasonably assured. Payments received\rprior to the satisfaction of above criteria are recorded as deferred revenue. Basic and Diluted\rEarnings (Loss) Per Common Share The basic net loss\rper common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net\rloss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an &#147;as converted&#148; basis, by the weighted average\rnumber of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For all periods presented, there were no potentially dilutive\rsecurities outstanding. Subsequent Events The Company evaluated\revents subsequent to December 31, 2015 through the date the financial statements were issued for disclosure consideration. Recently Issued\rAccounting Pronouncements In April 2015, the\rFASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt\rIssuance Costs (&#34;ASU 2015-03&#34;), which provides guidance on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs\ron the balance sheet. To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments in ASU No. 2015-03 require that debt issuance\rcosts related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of\rthat debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected\rby the amendments in this update. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest&#151;Imputation of Interest\r(Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements&#151;Amendments\rto SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting (SEC Update) (&#34;ASU 2015-15&#34;),\rto address the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Under ASU\r2015-15, entities are permitted to defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt\rissuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings\ron the line-of credit-arrangement. ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December\r15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period and early adoption is permitted for financial statements that\rhave not yet been previously issued. In accordance with ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, companies should apply the new guidance on\ra retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific\reffects of applying the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change\rin an accounting principle. The Company will adopt these pronouncements in the first quarter of 2016. Adoption is not expected\rto have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements, but will affect balance sheet presentation. In April 2015, the\rFASB issued ASU 2015-03, &#147;Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.&#148; ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance\rcosts related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of\rthat debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015,\rand interim periods within those annual periods, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of\rASU 2015-03 on the consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB\rissued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) - Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (&#34;ASU 2015-11&#34;), which\rsimplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net\rrealizable value test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in first-out\r(&#34;LIFO&#34;) and the retail inventory method. The guidance in ASU No. 2015-11 is effective for periods beginning after December\r15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this pronouncement in the first quarter of 2017 and is currently\revaluating the impact, if any, adoption will have on its financial position and results of operations. In September 2015,\rthe FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments(&#34;ASU\r2015-16&#34;), as part of its simplification initiative. Under ASU 2015-16, an acquirer would be required to recognize adjustments\rto provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts\rare determined. Further, the acquirer must record, in the financial statements for the same period, the effect on earnings of changes\rin depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated\ras if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Under ASU 2015-16, entities must also present separately on the\rface of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings by line item\rthat would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as\rof the acquisition date. The guidance in ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and should\rbe applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted\rfor financial statements that have not been issued. The Company adopted this pronouncement in the third quarter of 2015 and\rthe adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.In November 2015,\rthe FASB issued ASU 2015-17. ASU 2015-17 simplifies the classification of deferred income tax liabilities and assets on the\rbalance sheet by requiring deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet rather than\rclassifying them separately into current and non-current amounts. The guidance in ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for periods beginning\rafter December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted this pronouncement in the fourth quarter of\r2015 on a prospective basis. As a result, the Company has presented all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on\rthe accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, but has not reclassified current deferred tax assets and\rliabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014. See Note 8, &#147;Income Taxes&#148;,\rfor further information regarding the adoption of this standard. The Company\rdoes not believe that any other recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted,\rwould have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements."

S'Nature of Organization Coates International, Ltd. is a Delaware\rcorporation organized in October 1991 as successor-in-interest to a Delaware corporation of the same name incorporated in August\r1988. Coates International, Ltd. and its majority-owned subsidiaries Coates Oklahoma Engine Manufacturing, Ltd. (&#147;Coates\rOklahoma&#148;) and Coates Hi-Tech Engines, Ltd. (Coates Hi-Tech&#148;) (collectively, the &#147;Company&#148;) operate in\rWall Township, New Jersey. The Company&#146;s majority-owned subsidiaries had not commenced operations as of December 31, 2012. The Company has acquired the exclusive\rlicensing rights for the Coates spherical rotary valve (&#147;CSRV&#148;) system technology in North America, Central America\rand South America (the &#147;CSRV License&#148;). The CSRV system technology has been developed over a period of more than 20\ryears by the Company&#146;s founder George J. Coates and his son Gregory Coates. The CSRV system technology is adaptable for use\rin piston-driven internal combustion engines of many types and has been patented in the United States and numerous countries throughout\rthe world. The CSRV system technology is designed\rto replace the intake and exhaust conventional &#147;poppet valves&#148; currently used in almost all piston-driven, automotive,\rtruck, motorcycle, marine and electric power generator engines, among others. Unlike conventional valves which protrude into the\rengine cylinder, the CSRV system technology utilizes spherical valves that rotate in a cavity formed between a two-piece cylinder\rhead. The CSRV system technology utilizes significantly fewer moving parts than conventional poppet valve assemblies. As a result\rof these design improvements, management believes that engines incorporating the CSRV system technology (&#147;Coates Engines&#148;)\rwill last significantly longer and will require less lubrication over the life of the engine, as compared to conventional engines.\rIn addition, CSRV Engines can be designed with larger openings into the engine cylinder than with conventional valves so that more\rfuel and air can be inducted into, and expelled from, the cylinder in a shorter period of time. Larger valve openings permit higher\rrevolutions-per-minute (RPM&#146;s) and permit higher compression ratios with lower combustion chamber temperatures, allowing\rthe Coates Engine to produce more power than equivalent conventional engines. The extent, to which higher RPM&#146;s, greater\rvolumetric efficiency and thermal efficiency can be achieved with the CSRV system technology, is a function of the engine design\rand application. Coates Hi-Tech was formed in 2012 for\rthe purpose of applying for a package of business, finance and tax benefit incentives from state and local municipalities. Certain\rstates and their municipalities generally will offer such incentives to companies as an inducement to establish manufacturing operations\rwithin their jurisdiction, resulting in a stimulus to their economy and the creation of new jobs. Should the Company accept such\ran incentive package and decide to locate its manufacturing operations in a particular state, it would be required to raise substantial\rnew working capital to carry out such an undertaking. Coates Oklahoma was formed in 2011 for\rthe purpose of applying for a package of business, finance and tax benefit incentives. Oklahoma generally will offer such incentives\rto companies as an inducement to establish manufacturing operations in Oklahoma, resulting in a stimulus to the state economy and\rthe creation of new jobs. Should the Company decide to locate its manufacturing operations in Oklahoma, it would be required to\rraise substantial new working capital to carry out this undertaking. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial\rstatements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;)\rand rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;).  Since the Company&#146;s inception,\rthe Company has been responsible for the development costs of the CSRV technology in order to optimize the value of the licensing\rrights and has incurred related operational costs, the bulk of which have been funded primarily through cash generated from sales\rof stock, short term promissory notes, capital contributions, loans made by George J. Coates, Bernadette Coates and certain directors,\rfees received from research and development of prototype models, licensing fees and a small number of CSRV engine generator sales.\rThe Company has incurred substantial cumulative losses from operations since its inception. Losses from operations are expected\rto continue until the Coates Engines are successfully introduced into and accepted in the marketplace, or the Company receives\rsubstantial licensing revenues. These losses from operations were substantially related to research and development of the Company&#146;s\rintellectual property rights, patent filing and maintenance costs and general and administrative expenses. As shown in the accompanying consolidated\rfinancial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations and, as of December 31, 2012, had a stockholders&#146;\rdeficiency of ($3,937,000). The Company will be required to renegotiate the terms of an extension of a $1,575,000 mortgage loan\rwhich matures in July 2013, or successfully refinance the property with another mortgage lender, if possible. Failure to do so\rcould adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial position and results of operations. In addition, the current economic environment,\rwhich is characterized by tight credit markets, investor uncertainty about how to safely invest their funds and low investor confidence,\rhas introduced additional risk and difficulty to the Company&#146;s challenge to secure needed additional working capital. These\rfactors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management has instituted a cost\rcontrol program intended to restrict variable costs to only those expenses that are necessary to complete its activities related\rto entering the production phase of operations, develop additional commercially feasible applications of the CSRV system technology,\rseek additional sources of working capital and cover general and administrative costs in support of such activities. The Company\rhas been actively undertaking efforts to secure new sources of working capital. At the December 31, 2012, the Company had negative\rworking capital of ($5,893,000) compared with negative working capital of ($3,753,000) at the end of 2011.  During the years ended December\r31, 2012 and 2011, the Company raised $1,123,000 and $1,357,000, respectively, of new working capital from the following:  For the year ended December 31, 2011,\rthe Company also received cash from research and development of $150,000 and earned gross profit of $60,000 from the sale of a\rCSRV electric power, engine generator. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company\ridentified cracks on the lower engine heads of its Gen Sets that resulted from a defect in the manufacturing by one of its suppliers.\rBased on testing of the Gen Set to confirm the Company&#146;s resolution of this problem, management believes it has determined\rthe cause of this cracked head condition. As soon as the Company raises sufficient working capital, it will procure new cast-steel\rhead castings to resolve the cracked head problems with the engines originally shipped to Almont and undertake field testing of\rthe generators, after which, it will begin larger scale production. The Company continues to actively seek\rout new sources of working capital; however, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in these efforts. The accompanying\rconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as\ra going concern. Certain amounts included in the accompanying\rfinancials statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been reclassified in order to make them comparable to the amounts\rpresented for the year ended December 31, 2012. Principles of Consolidation The financial statements of the Company\rwere consolidated with the accounts of Coates Hi-Tech Engines, Ltd., a majority-owned subsidiary commencing in July 2012 and Coates\rOklahoma Engine Manufacturing, Ltd., a majority-owned subsidiary commencing in August 2011. Neither of these companies had commenced\roperations at December 31, 2012. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts were eliminated in consolidation. Revenue Recognition Sales and cost of sales are recognized\rat the time of shipment, provided the risk of loss has transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably\rassured. Shipping arrangements and costs are the responsibility of the customer. Revenue from research and development\ractivities is recognized when collection of the related revenues is reasonably assured and, when applicable, in accordance with\rAccounting Standards Update No. 2010-17, &#147;Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition, a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues\rTask Force&#148;. This standard provides guidance on defining a milestone and permits recognition of revenue from research and\rdevelopment that is contingent upon achievement of one or more specified milestones defined in the research and development arrangements\rwhich meet specified criteria for such revenue recognition. Unearned revenue represents a deposit\rfrom a customer for a CSRV Gen Set order. Revenue is recognized as described above. Licensing deposits, which are non-refundable,\rreceived from the granting of sub-licenses, are recognized as earned, generally commencing upon the completion of certain tests\rand acceptance by the licensee. At that time, license revenue will be recognized ratably over the period of time that the sub-license\rhas been granted using the straight-line method. Upon termination of a sub-license agreement, non-refundable license deposits,\rless any costs related to the termination of the sub-license agreement, are recognized as revenue. Revenue from research and development\ractivities is recognized when earned and realization is reasonably assured, provided that financial risk has been transferred from\rthe Company to its customer. The Company commenced shipping production\runits to Almont under the Canadian Sublicense in April 2011 and began recognizing the license deposit of $300,000 on the Canadian\rLicensee as revenue on a straight-line basis over the approximate remaining life through 2027 of the last CSRV technology patent\rin force, at that date. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed\rwhen incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company charged $115,000 to expense for the estimated remediation costs\rfor previously sold Gen Sets determined to have cracked heads. Intellectual Property Under a licensing agreement with George\rJ. Coates and Gregory Coates, the Company obtained the rights to manufacture, use and sell the CSRV engine technology throughout\rthe territory defined as the Western Hemisphere. In accordance with GAAP, the Company is not permitted to record a value for this\rintellectual property because it was obtained from principal stockholders, and, accordingly this intangible asset is not reflected\rin the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  Licensing Costs Under the CSRV Licensing Agreement for\rthe CSRV engine technology, the Company is responsible for all costs in connection with applying for, obtaining and maintenance\rof patents to protect the CSRV system technology. Such costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising Costs Advertising costs, which are included\rin general and administrative expenses, are expensed when incurred. Advertising expense amounted to $5,000 and $28,000 for the\ryears ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense relating to stock-based\rpayments is recognized as an expense using the fair value measurement method. Under the fair value method, the estimated fair value\rof awards to employees is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the earlier of\rthe employee&#146;s retirement eligibility date or the vesting period of the award. The Company incurs non-cash, stock-based compensation\rexpense for stock options awarded and for awards of restricted shares of its common stock under it 2006 Stock Option and Incentive\rPlan.  Deferred Stock-Based Compensation Deferred stock-based compensation represents\rthe estimated fair value of restricted shares of the Company&#146;s common stock awarded to officers and directors, issuance of\rwhich has been delayed into the future, plus the estimated amount of the Company&#146;s obligation to pay the personal income\rtaxes of the award recipient.  Inventory Inventory consists of raw materials and\rwork-in-process, including overhead and is stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the first-in, first-out method.\rInventory items designated as obsolete or slow moving are reduced to net realizable value. Market value is determined using current\rreplacement cost.  Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated\rat cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets: 40 years for buildings\rand building improvements, 3 to 7 years for machinery and equipment and 5 to 10 years for furniture and fixtures. Repairs and maintenance\rexpenditures, which do not extend the useful lives of the related assets, are expensed as incurred. In the event that facts and circumstances\rindicate that long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed. Should such evaluation indicate\rthat there has been an impairment of one or more long-lived assets, the cost basis of such assets would be adjusted accordingly,\rat that time.  Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities\rare computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable\ror deductible amounts in the future. Such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and\rrates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established\rwhen necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized and are adjusted when conditions indicate that\rdeferred assets will be realized. Income tax expense (benefit) is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the\rchange during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates any uncertain tax\rpositions for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position\rwill be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. In the event recognition of an uncertain\rtax position is indicated, the Company measures the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized\rupon ultimate settlement. This process of evaluating and estimating uncertain tax positions and tax benefits requires the\rconsideration of many factors, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. Interest\rand penalties, if any, related to tax contingencies would be included in income tax expense.  Loss per Share Basic net loss per share is based on\rthe weighted average number of common shares outstanding without consideration of potentially dilutive shares of common stock.\rThere were no shares of preferred stock outstanding with rights to share in the Company&#146;s net income during the years ended\rDecember 31, 2012 and 2011. Diluted net income per share is based on the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive\rcommon shares outstanding, when applicable. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company&#146;s\rconsolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\rreported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\rand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These significant estimates include determining\rthe fair value of convertible promissory notes containing embedded derivatives and variable conversion rates, determining a value\rfor Series A Preferred Stock issued and certain limited anti-dilution rights granted to George J. Coates as more fully described\rin Note 17, assigning useful lives to the Company&#146;s property, plant and equipment, determining an appropriate amount to reserve\rfor obsolete and slow moving inventory, estimating a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, assigning expected lives to,\rand estimating the rate of forfeitures of, stock options granted and selecting a trading price volatility factor for the Company&#146;s\rcommon stock in order to estimate the fair value of the Company&#146;s stock options on the date of grant or other appropriate\rmeasurement date. Actual results could differ from those estimates.'

S'2. Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and include the accounts of the Partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. We review our estimates on an ongoing basis using currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates, and actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Sales Sales of propylene and by-products are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, goods have been delivered, consideration to be received is fixed and determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Cash received in advance of product delivery to the customer is reported as deferred revenue. Upon delivery to the customer and satisfaction of the aforementioned criteria for sales recognition, the deferred revenue is reported as a sale. Sales are presented net of discounts and allowances. By-product sales are reported together with propylene sales. Transportation costs billed to customers are also recorded as a component of sales. Inventory purchases and sales transactions with the same counterparty are combined for accounting purposes if they were entered into in contemplation of each other. Inventory purchases and sales under buy/sell transactions are treated as inventory exchanges in our statements of comprehensive income (loss). This treatment of buy/sell transactions eliminates sales and purchases in equal amounts in our statements of comprehensive income (loss). Accordingly, no gain or loss is recognized on the transaction at the time, with any difference in value between the two transactions recorded as an additional cost of inventory. Cost of Sales Cost of sales represents the costs of propylene and by-products sold. These costs include the cost of propane, fuel and utilities used in the propylene production process, such as natural gas, nitrogen and electricity, as well as direct operating expenses along with insurance and property tax expenses associated with the facility. Direct operating expenses include all direct and indirect labor at the facility. Depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, exclusive of the amortization of deferred financing fees, are also included within cost of sales. In addition to propylene, the facility generates commercial quantities of the following by-products during the production process: hydrogen, C4 mix stream, and C5+ stream. During certain periods in 2012, 2011 and 2010, the facility operated below normal capacity. Accordingly, we recorded charges to cost of sales to reflect unabsorbed fixed overhead costs. The facility&#8217;s substantial fixed cost structure and limited operations in the period immediately following commencement of operations resulted in a gross operating loss for 2010. Development Expense Development expense includes preliminary engineering and design work for capital projects which do not qualify for capitalization under GAAP. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all short-term instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash in bank deposit accounts that, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts, and we believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. Restricted Cash Our prior credit facility included certain restrictions with respect to our cash accounts. As such, the cash balances within these accounts of $45.8 million have been classified as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011. We had no restricted cash balances at December 31, 2012. During 2010, we used restricted cash of $30.0 million to fund the construction of the facility which is reported as an investing activity in the 2010 consolidated statement of cash flows. Except as noted below, restricted cash as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, was held to fund operating activities. During 2011, following the conversion of our construction loan to a term loan that was scheduled to mature in 2014, we funded $10.9 million into a debt service reserve to serve as collateral for our debt. This cash outflow is classified as a financing cash flow in the 2011 consolidated statement of cash flows. During 2011, we also funded $3.0 million into a major maintenance reserve, which was to be used to fund future major maintenance expenditures. This amount has been included in operating activities in the 2011 consolidated statement of cash flows. We also used restricted cash of $31.9 million at December 31, 2011, in 2012 to fund operating expenses which is reported as cash flows from operating activities in the 2012 consolidated statement of cash flows. During 2012, restrictions on our cash balances were lifted in connection with the refinancing of our prior credit facility. Accounts Receivable We extend credit to customers in accordance with normal industry standards and terms. We review accounts receivable monthly and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on known factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. Accounts receivable are not collateralized, and we may charge interest on receivables should they become past due. To date, we have not recorded any interest income related to past due receivables. Inventory Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the weighted-average method. Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets As of December 31, 2012,  prepaid expenses and other current assets consists primarily of a $40.0 million cash deposit we made to a counterparty as collateral for our commodity derivative contracts (the propane swaps).  The cash is held by the counterparty.  As of December 31, 2011, prepaid expenses and other current assets consist primarily of costs associated with the IPO as well as costs related to our 2012 debt refinancing. The costs associated with the IPO were deferred until the IPO was effective in May 2012, at which time the costs were reflected as a reduction in the IPO proceeds in the consolidated statement of changes in partners&#8217; capital. Deferred costs related to our IPO were $3.1 million as of December 31, 2011. The costs associated with our debt refinancing were deferred until we completed our debt refinancing in March 2012, at which time we began amortizing the costs over the life of the refinanced debt. At December 31, 2011, deferred financing costs related to our debt refinancing were $0.6 million. Derivative Instruments Commencing October 2011 and through March 2012, we entered into the propane swaps with settlement dates in 2012 and 2013 to manage our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to propane, our sole feedstock. The propane swaps were designed to mitigate the risk associated with unfavorable market movements in the price of energy commodities. Our propane swaps were intended to act as a hedging (offset) mechanism against the volatility of energy commodity prices by allowing us to transfer some of the price risk to counterparties who are able and willing to bear it. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC or Codification) Topic 815,Derivatives and Hedging(ASC Topic 815), addresses the accounting for derivative contracts. We enter into our commodity derivative contracts to economically hedge an exposure through a relationship that does not qualify for hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815. Our derivative contracts are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities, as applicable, at fair value on the balance sheet, and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the statement of comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts represent the non-cash change in the fair value of these derivative instruments and do not impact operating cash flows on the cash flow statement. Until settlement occurs, this will result in non-cash gains or losses being reported in our operating results as gain or loss on derivatives. In addition to the propane swaps, we entered into an interest rate protection agreement in July 2012 for a nominal amount whereby we capped the three month LIBOR rate at 2.0% for up to $115.5 million on our term loan. The agreement terminates March 27, 2014. Omnibus Agreement On May 9, 2012, the General Partner, the Partnership, Propylene Holdings, PL Propylene and PL Manufacturing entered into an omnibus agreement (the omnibus agreement). Pursuant to the omnibus agreement and a related pledge agreement (the pledge agreement), the Partnership allocated all of its benefits and obligations under the propane swaps to PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members. Under the omnibus agreement and the pledge agreement, any amounts received by the Partnership under the propane swaps will be distributed to PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members, and any amounts that the Partnership is required to pay under the propane swaps will be contributed to the Partnership as a capital contribution by PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members. While the Partnership does not receive any of the benefits of the propane swaps, it remains a party to the propane swaps, and will be obligated to make payments to the propane swap counterparties as they come due and to post any collateral as required, under the terms of the propane swap agreement. As a result, the Partnership will continue to record the fair value of the propane swaps on its balance sheet with the related charge being reflected in its statement of comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 79. To the extent that the Partnership makes payments under the propane swaps, PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members will be responsible for making quarterly capital contributions in an amount equal to the sum of all payments made by the Partnership under such propane swaps during the applicable fiscal quarter or owed by the Partnership at the end of the quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2012, PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members paid approximately $47.0 million to the Partnership as reimbursement for realized losses on the propane swaps pro-rated from May 9, 2012, the closing date of the IPO, through December 31, 2012. The contributions are partially made in the form of a reduction in the cash distribution paid to PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members with the remainder, if any, funded in cash from PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members. For realized losses on the propane swaps in the quarter ended December 31, 2012, PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members contributed approximately $31.9 million to the Partnership in February 2013 which was reflected as a related party account receivable at December 31, 2012, in our consolidated balance sheet. The contribution was partially funded through a reduction in the cash distribution to PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members in February 2013 with the remaining portion funded with a cash payment of approximately $2.8 million from PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members. In April 2012, we deposited $40.0 million in cash as collateral with the propane swaps counterparty. The cash is held by the counterparty and is reported as prepaid and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. The Partnership expects that PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members will continue to fund their future payment obligations primarily through quarterly distributions that they receive on common units that they own and through the form of additional cash payments should the quarterly distribution not be adequate to cover the amount due on the realized losses from the propane swaps. Under the pledge agreement, the PL Manufacturing Members pledged to PL Manufacturing (as collateral agent) a number of common units such that, at all times, the market value of all pledged units and all common units owned by PL Manufacturing that are subject to the omnibus agreement is equal to or greater than 10 times the mark-to-market value of the propane swaps, but in no event shall the number of pledged units be greater than the amount of units distributed to PL Manufacturing and the PL Manufacturing Members in connection with the IPO. The expected aggregate quarterly distributions for 2013 payable on all pledged common units, and the common units held by PL Manufacturing together with a cash reserve held by PL Manufacturing, are expected to be sufficient to cover future payments under the propane swaps. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement or sale, we remove the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation and reflect any resulting gain or loss in the statements of comprehensive income (loss). Repair and maintenance expenditures incurred in order to maintain the day-to-day operation of our existing assets are charged to expense as incurred. Costs associated with acquisitions and improvements that expand existing capacity or extend useful life, including related interest costs, are capitalized. Cost of planned major maintenance projects, known as turnarounds, will be deferred as incurred and amortized using the straight-line method over the period until the next plant turnaround, which is estimated to be approximately three years. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include the technology license we acquired related to the propane dehydrogenation process, which is essential to the design, construction and operation of the facility, as well as emission credits. The technology license is being amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of 25 years. The emission credits are an indefinite life intangible which is subject to an annual evaluation for impairment. Deferred Financing Costs and Other Assets Deferred financing costs and other assets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, consist primarily of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with the closings of our credit facility in March 2012 and June 2009, respectively. The costs associated with our credit facility are being amortized using the effective interest method and are classified as interest expense. During 2012 we successfully completed the refinancing of our debt, and the remaining unamortized costs associated with the prior credit facility were written off at that time resulting in a loss on early extinguishment of debt totaling $7.0 million. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential significant deterioration in future cash flows projected to be generated by the assets. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which is generally at the facility level, as we produce one principal product. If, upon review, the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. The fair values of impaired assets are usually determined based on the present value of projected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group, as quoted market prices in active markets are generally not available. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on projected production volumes, sales volumes, prices and costs, taking into consideration available internal and external information at the date of review. Should an impairment of assets arise, we would be required to record a charge to operations that could be material to the period reported. To date, we have not recorded any impairment charges. Asset Retirement Obligation An asset and a liability are recorded at fair value when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When the liability is initially recorded, this cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is increased for changes in present value, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Where we can reasonably estimate the asset retirement obligation, we accrue a liability based on an estimate of the timing and amount of settlement. In estimating our asset retirement obligations, we utilize several assumptions based on when the liabilities were recorded, including an inflation rate and a credit-adjusted discount rate. We record changes in these estimates based on changes in the expected amount and timing of payments to settle our obligations. Environmental Costs Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate, depending on future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed. Liabilities for expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis unless the amount and timing of cash payments for the liability are fixed or determinable, in which case they are recorded on a discounted basis. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized. Income Taxes We are a partnership and are treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes whereby the impact of our operations is subject to tax at the partner level. Therefore, no federal income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The aggregate difference in the basis of our net assets for financial and tax reporting purposes cannot be readily determined because information regarding each partner&#8217;s tax attributes is not available to us. As an entity operating in the State of Texas, we are subject to the Texas Margin Tax, which is an income tax. We follow the liability method of accounting for these income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. We recognize the tax effects of any uncertain tax positions we may adopt if the position taken by us is more likely than not sustainable based on its technical merits. If a tax position meets such criteria, the tax effect that would be recognized by us would be the largest amount of benefit with more than a 50% chance of being realized. See Note 11 for additional information regarding our income taxes. Equity-Based Compensation We recognize compensation expense related to equity-based awards granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures (see Notes 12 and 13). The grant date fair value of the equity-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. We also account for equity-based awards granted to non-employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards. The measurement of equity-based compensation for awards granted to non-employees is subject to periodic adjustment as the awards vest, and the resulting change in value is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income (loss) during the period the related services are rendered. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We consider cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accounts receivable-related parties, accounts payable-related parties, and accrued liabilities to be financial instruments in which the carrying amounts represent fair value because of the short-term nature of the accounts. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in a principal or most advantageous market. Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on inputs, which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs.The Codification establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework that ranks the quality and reliability of information used to determine fair values. The hierarchy is associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value and defines three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process&#8212;quoted prices are the most reliable valuation inputs, whereas model values that include inputs based on unobservable data are the least reliable. Each fair value measurement must be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1   Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2   Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The Partnership makes certain assumptions it believes that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, and the risks inherent in the inputs to valuation techniques. Credit risk of the Partnership and its counterparties is incorporated in the valuation of assets and liabilities. The Partnership believes it uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market-based inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The following table presents the financial instruments that require fair value disclosure as of December 31, 2012, by level within thehierarchy:  The following table presents the financial instruments that require fair value disclosure as of December 31, 2011:  The variable rate debt is deemed to be a Level 2 financial instrument because it is based on observable market data. At December 31, 2012, the fair value was determined based on active trades and market corroborated data. To determine the fair value at December 31, 2011, we reviewed the current market interest rates and terms of similar debt, and concluded that the carrying value of the variable rate debt approximates the fair value. The valuation assumptions utilized to measure the fair value of our propane swaps were observable inputs based on market data obtained from independent sources and are considered Level 2 inputs. To determine the fair value of the propane swaps, we utilized quoted prices for similar assets, liabilities and market-corroborated inputs.  See Note 7 for discussion regarding our propane swaps. There are no financial instruments that are split across the levels, and there have been no financial instruments that transferred between the levels during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Segment Reporting We operate in one segment for the production and sale of propylene and related by-products. All of our operations are located in Houston, Texas. Net Income (Loss) Per Common Unit Net income (loss) per common unit for a given period is based on the distributions that are made to the unitholders plus an allocation of undistributed net income (loss) based on provisions of the partnership agreement, divided by the weighted average number of common units outstanding. The two-class method dictates that net income (loss) for a period be reduced by the amount of distributions and that any residual amount representing undistributed net income (loss) be allocated to common unitholders and any other participating unitholders to the extent that each unit may share in net income (loss) as if all of the net income (loss) for the period had been distributed in accordance with the partnership agreement. Restricted units granted under the PetroLogistics Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Long-Term Incentive Plan) are eligible for Unit Distribution Rights (UDRs). To the extent that non-forfeitable UDRs are awarded, the underlying nonvested restricted units are considered participating securities for purposes of determining net income (loss) per unit.  Undistributed income is allocated to participating securities based on the proportional relationship of the weighted average number of common units and restricted units outstanding. Undistributed losses (including those resulting from distributions in excess of net income) are allocated to common units based on provisions of the partnership agreement. Undistributed losses are not allocated to nonvested restricted units as they do not participate in net losses.  Distributions are treated as distributed earnings in the computation of earnings per common unit even though cash distributions are not necessarily derived from current or prior period earnings. The General Partner does not have an economic interest in the Partnership and, therefore, does not participate in the Partnership&#8217;s net income (loss).  Prior to the IPO, we were wholly-owned by Propylene Holdings.  Accordingly, net income (loss) per common unit is not presented for periods prior to the IPO. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) and the allocation of net income (loss) to the common units and the restricted units for purposes of computing net income (loss) per unit for the period from May 9, 2012, the closing date of the IPO, through December 31, 2012, (in thousands, except units and per unit data):  Recently Issued Accounting Standards In May 2011, the FASB issued new guidance for fair value measurements intended to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The amended guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value to ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The amended guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. We adopted the new fair value measurement guidance on January 1, 2012, and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance that modified how comprehensive income is presented in an entity&#8217;s financial statements. The guidance requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements and eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. We adopted the guidance pertaining to the presentation of other comprehensive income as of January 1, 2012, and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial statements or results of operations. In December 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update on disclosures for offsetting assets and liabilities. The new accounting guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about (1) instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position, and (2) instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. The accounting standards update will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. Reclassifications Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified in order to conform to the current period presentation.'
