During the first quarter of 2009, the Company reclassified $24 billion of certain fixed-income securities from short-term marketable securities to long-term marketable securities in the September 27, 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The reclassification resulted from a change in accounting presentation for certain investments based on contractual maturity dates, which more closely reflects the Company s assessment of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash. As a result of this change, marketable securities with maturities less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term.  There have been no changes in the Company s investment policies or practices associated with this change in accounting presentation.
