Note 1 &#x2013; Summary of Significant Accounting
 PoliciesApple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
 (collectively &#x201C;Apple&#x201D; or the &#x201C;Company&#x201D;)
 designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media
 devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and
 sells a variety of related software, services, accessories,
 networking solutions and third-party digital content and
 applications. The Company sells its products worldwide through its
 retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as
 through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,
 retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells
 a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including
 application software and various accessories through its online and
 retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized
 businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.Basis of Presentation and PreparationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements
 include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and
 transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the
 Company&#x2019;s management, the consolidated financial statements
 reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature,
 necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The
 preparation of these consolidated financial statements in
 conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
 (&#x201C;GAAP&#x201D;) requires management to make estimates and
 assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated
 financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
 differ materially from those estimates.The Company&#x2019;s fiscal year is the 52 or
 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The
 Company&#x2019;s fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended on
 September&#xA0;26, 2015,&#xA0;September&#xA0;27, 2014 and
 September&#xA0;28, 2013, respectively. An additional week is
 included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years
 to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal years
 2015, 2014 and 2013 each spanned 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated,
 references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer
 to the Company&#x2019;s fiscal years ended in September and the
 associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.Revenue RecognitionNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the
 sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications,
 accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company
 recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
 exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
 determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered
 delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk
 of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of
 the Company&#x2019;s product sales, these criteria are met at the
 time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for
 some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain
 other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives
 the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of
 loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of
 the Company&#x2019;s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized
 as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence
 that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful
 history of collection, without concession, on comparable
 arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of
 hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential
 to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital
 content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue
 recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in
 accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for
 the following types of sales transactions: (i)&#xA0;standalone
 sales of software products, (ii)&#xA0;sales of software upgrades
 and (iii)&#xA0;sales of software bundled with hardware not
 essential to the functionality of the hardware.For the sale of most third-party products, the
 Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to
 customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such
 products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is
 the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for
 amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold
 through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content
 sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the
 selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the
 customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net
 basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains
 from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers
 that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and
 certain digital content owners is not reflected in the
 Company&#x2019;s Consolidated Statements of Operations.&#xA0;The Company records deferred revenue when it
 receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the
 performance of services. This includes amounts that have been
 deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and
 non-software services that are attached to hardware and software
 products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and
 online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes
 Store, App Store, Mac App Store and iBooks Store for the purchase
 of digital content and software. The Company records deferred
 revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon
 redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare
 service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the
 service coverage periods. AppleCare service and support contracts
 typically include extended phone support, repair services,
 web-based support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the
 Company&#x2019;s standard limited warranty.The Company records reductions to revenue for
 estimated commitments related to price protection and other
 customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price
 protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated
 amount to be refunded. For the Company&#x2019;s other customer
 incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is
 recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold
 the product or the date at which the program is offered. The
 Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future
 product returns based on the Company&#x2019;s historical experience.
 Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are
 remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes
 recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant
 government authority.Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple
 DeliverablesFor multi-element arrangements that include
 hardware products containing software essential to the hardware
 product&#x2019;s functionality, undelivered software elements that
 relate to the hardware product&#x2019;s essential software, and
 undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to
 all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such
 circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the
 selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables:
 (i)&#xA0;vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
 (&#x201C;VSOE&#x201D;), (ii)&#xA0;third-party evidence of selling
 price (&#x201C;TPE&#x201D;) and (iii)&#xA0;best estimate of selling
 price (&#x201C;ESP&#x201D;). VSOE generally exists only when the
 Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually
 charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the
 Company&#x2019;s best estimates of what the selling prices of
 elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone
 basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance
 with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company
 allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each
 element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when
 elements lacking VSOE are delivered.For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad
 and iPod touch (&#x201C;iOS devices&#x201D;), Mac, Apple Watch and
 Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time
 provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device&#x2019;s
 essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. The
 Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included
 in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first
 deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the
 allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to
 the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of
 sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with
 qualifying devices to receive on a when-and-if-available basis,
 future unspecified software upgrades relating to the
 product&#x2019;s essential software. The third deliverable is the
 non-software services to be provided to qualifying devices. The
 Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the
 relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE
 nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based
 on the Company&#x2019;s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered
 hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the
 time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition
 have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified
 software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred
 and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period
 the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be
 provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related
 essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are
 recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide
 non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred,
 and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as
 operating expenses as incurred.The Company&#x2019;s process for determining its ESP
 for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors
 that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances
 related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices
 charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar
 offerings, product specific business objectives, length of time a
 particular version of a device has been available, estimated cost
 to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the
 upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total
 selling price of the product.Beginning in September 2015, the Company reduced
 the combined ESPs for iOS devices and Mac between $5 and $10 to
 reflect the increase in competitive offers for similar products at
 little to no cost for users, which reduces the amount the Company
 could reasonably charge for these deliverables on a standalone
 basis.Shipping CostsAmounts billed to customers related to shipping and
 handling are classified as revenue, and the Company&#x2019;s
 shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales.&#xA0;Warranty CostsThe Company generally provides for the estimated
 cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related
 revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its
 accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary
 based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.Software Development CostsResearch and development (&#x201C;R&amp;D&#x201D;)
 costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer
 software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to
 capitalization beginning when a product&#x2019;s technological
 feasibility has been established and ending when a product is
 available for general release to customers. In most instances, the
 Company&#x2019;s products are released soon after technological
 feasibility has been established and as a result software
 development costs were expensed as incurred.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and
 included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 Advertising expense was $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion
 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Share-based CompensationThe Company recognizes expense related to
 share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee
 services in exchange for (a)&#xA0;equity instruments of the Company
 or (b)&#xA0;liabilities that are based on the fair value of the
 Company&#x2019;s equity instruments or that may be settled by the
 issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost
 for restricted stock and restricted stock units
 (&#x201C;RSUs&#x201D;) is measured based on the closing fair market
 value of the Company&#x2019;s common stock on the date of grant. The
 Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the
 award&#x2019;s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for
 time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent
 on the achievement of performance conditions. The Company
 recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the
 Consolidated Statements of Shareholders&#x2019; Equity if an excess
 tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the
 indirect effects of share-based compensation on R&amp;D tax
 credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions
 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information
 regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9,
 &#x201C;Benefit Plans.&#x201D;Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes is computed using
 the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
 liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
 of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
 bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax
 credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
 measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
 taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
 and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company
 records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the
 amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an
 uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax
 position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
 authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax
 benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions
 are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater
 than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5,
 &#x201C;Income Taxes&#x201D; for additional information.Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing
 income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
 number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
 Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available
 to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
 common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the
 number of additional shares of common stock that would have been
 outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.
 Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options,
 shares to be purchased under the Company&#x2019;s employee stock
 purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The
 dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in
 diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock
 method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair
 market value of the Company&#x2019;s common stock can result in a
 greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.&#xA0;The following table shows the computation of basic
 and diluted earnings per share for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (net income
 in millions and shares in thousands):&#xA0;Potentially dilutive securities whose effect would
 have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted
 earnings per share.Financial InstrumentsCash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesAll highly liquid investments with maturities of
 three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash
 equivalents. The Company&#x2019;s marketable debt and equity
 securities have been classified and accounted for asavailable-for-sale.Management
 determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the
 time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each
 balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt
 securities as either short-term or long-term based on each
 instrument&#x2019;s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable
 debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified
 as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities
 greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. Marketable
 equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either
 short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and
 its availability for use in current operations. The Company&#x2019;s
 marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value,
 with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
 component of accumulated other comprehensive income
 (&#x201C;AOCI&#x201D;) in shareholders&#x2019; equity, with the
 exception of unrealized losses believed to be other-than-temporary
 which are reported in earnings in the current period. The cost of
 securities sold is based upon the specific identification
 method.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company accounts for its derivative instruments
 as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure
 to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as
 cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
 derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in
 shareholders&#x2019; equity and reclassified into earnings in the
 same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
 earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the
 derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings in the
 current period. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow
 hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected
 future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as
 cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
 assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in
 earnings.For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure
 to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that
 are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on
 the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on
 the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current
 period.For derivative instruments and foreign currency
 debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency
 exchange rates used for translation of the net investment in a
 foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment
 hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the
 derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign
 currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts
 designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes
 in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component
 from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or
 losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in
 earnings in the current period.Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are
 adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period.&#xA0;Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe Company records its allowance for doubtful
 accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including
 historical experience, age of the accounts receivable balances,
 credit quality of the Company&#x2019;s customers, current economic
 conditions and other factors that may affect the customers&#x2019;
 ability to pay.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost,
 computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable
 value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their
 net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current
 period. As of September&#xA0;26, 2015 and September&#xA0;27, 2014,
 the Company&#x2019;s inventories consist primarily of finished
 goods.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
 Depreciation is computed by use of thestraight-linemethod over the
 estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the
 lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying
 building; between one to five years for machinery and equipment,
 including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and
 the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements.
 The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop
 internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the
 preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to
 internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method
 over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from
 three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on
 property and equipment was $9.2 billion, $6.9 billion and $5.8
 billion during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired
 Intangible AssetsThe Company reviews property, plant and equipment,
 inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable
 intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets
 are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
 circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
 recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by
 comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash
 flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and
 equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable
 intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
 recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the
 assets exceeds its fair value.The Company does not amortize goodwill and
 intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets
 are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or
 sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
 the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and
 intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each
 year. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related
 to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2015, 2014
 and 2013. The Company established reporting units based on its
 current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for
 impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to
 the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2015 and 2014, the
 Company&#x2019;s goodwill was primarily allocated to the Americas
 and Europe reporting units.The Company amortizes its intangible assets with
 definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews
 these assets for impairment. The Company typically amortizes its
 acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods
 from three to seven years.Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company applies fair value accounting for all
 financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and
 liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
 financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair
 value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or
 paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
 market participants at the measurement date. When determining the
 fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are
 required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the
 principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would
 transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that
 market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability,
 such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer
 restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying
 the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to
 measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization
 within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is
 available and significant to the fair value measurement:Level 1&#x2013; Quoted prices in active markets for
 identical assets or liabilities.Level 2&#x2013; Observable inputs other than
 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
 liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
 liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are
 observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
 substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3&#x2013; Inputs that are generally
 unobservable and typically reflect management&#x2019;s estimate of
 assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
 or liability.&#xA0;The Company&#x2019;s valuation techniques used to
 measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable
 equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets
 for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used
 to measure the fair value of the Company&#x2019;s debt instruments
 and all other financial instruments, all of which have
 counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on
 quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant
 inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.In accordance with the fair value accounting
 requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial
 instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has
 not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial
 instruments.Foreign Currency Translation and RemeasurementThe Company translates the assets and liabilities
 of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S.
 dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period.
 Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using
 rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and
 losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency
 translation included in AOCI in shareholders&#x2019; equity. The
 Company&#x2019;s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their
 functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at
 exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and
 inventories, property and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at
 historical rates.
