18 Independent Auditors' Report
The Board of Directors
Electronic Data Systems Corporation     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Electronic Data Systems Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1999. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the related financial
statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Electronic
Data Systems Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. s/ KPMG LLP

23 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business
Electronic Data Systems Corporation is a professional services firm
that offers its clients a portfolio of related services worldwide within the
broad categories of systems and technology services, business process
management, management consulting, and electronic business. Services include the
management of computers, networks, information systems, information processing
facilities, business operations and related personnel. As used herein, the terms
EDS and the Company refer to Electronic Data Systems Corporation, and its
consolidated subsidiaries.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EDS and
its controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The Company investments in companies in
which it does not control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence
over operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity
method.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share of common stock is computed using the
weighted-average number of EDS common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share reflects the incremental increase in common shares
outstanding assuming the exercise of all employee stock options and restricted
stock units that would have had a dilutive effect on earnings per share. A
reconciliation of the number of shares used in the calculation of basic and
diluted earnings per share is as follows for the years ended December 31, 1999,
1998 and 1997 in millions                               Years Ended December 31,
1999  1998  1997
Basic earnings per share of common stock:
Weighted-average common shares outstanding.   4862 4922 4898
Effect of dilutive securities Note 10:
Restricted stock     60  27  37
Stock     58  06  04
Diluted earnings per share:
Weighted-average common and common equivalent
shares    4980 4955 4939
Securities that were outstanding but were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect was antidilutive
include restricted stock units of 04 million and 54 million shares for the
years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and options to purchase
16 million, 96 million and 101 million shares of common stock for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Marketable Securities
Marketable securities at December 31, 1999 and 1998 consist of
government and agency obligations, corporate debt, and corporate equity
securities. The Company classifies all of its debt and marketable equity
securities as available-for-sale, and they are recorded at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains, net of the related tax effect, totaling $2615
million, $748 million and $235 million at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of
shareholders' equity until realized. Any decline in the fair value of an
available-for-sale security below its cost that is deemed other than temporary
is charged to earnings, resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for
the security.
24 Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation of property
and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the lesser of
the asset estimated useful life, the life of the related customer contract, or
the term of the lease in the case of leasehold improvements. The ranges of
estimated useful lives are as follows                                     Years
20-40
5-20
Computer   3-8
Other equipment and   3-15
Software, Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Software purchased by the Company and utilized in designing, installing
and operating business information and communications systems is capitalized and
amortized on a straight-line basis over a two- to five-year period. Costs of
developing and maintaining software systems are incurred primarily in connection
with client contracts and are considered contract costs. Software development
costs for computer software that is sold, leased or otherwise marketed as a
separate product or as part of a product or process that are incurred subsequent
to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized. Effective January 1,
1999, software development costs that are incurred to meet the Company
internal needs are capitalized. Amounts capitalized as software development
costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years.
The cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable
assets based on estimated fair values. Costs allocated to identifiable
intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining
estimated useful lives of the assets, as determined by underlying contract terms
or independent appraisals. Such lives range from two to ten years. The excess of
the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, net of
liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill and amortized on a straight-line
basis over the useful life. The useful life is determined based on the
individual characteristics of the acquired entity and ranges from five to forty
years.
The Company periodically evaluates the carrying amounts of goodwill, as
well as the related amortization periods, to determine whether adjustments to
these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and
circumstances. The evaluation is based on the Company projection of the
undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation over the
remaining useful lives of the related goodwill. To the extent such projections
indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the
carrying amounts of related goodwill, the underlying assets are written down by
charges to expense so that the carrying amount is equal to future undiscounted
cash flows. The assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be affected if
estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved.
Revenue Recognition
The Company provides services under level-of-effort and fixed-price
contracts, which generally extend up to ten years. Under level-of-effort
contracts, revenue is recognized as services are provided to the client in
accordance with contractual billing schedules. For certain fixed-price
contracts, revenue is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, based
on the percentage that incurred contract costs to date bear to total estimated
contract costs after giving effect to the most recent estimates of total cost.
The effect of changes to total estimated contract costs is recognized in the
period such changes are determined. Provisions for estimated losses are made in
the period in which the loss first becomes apparent. Revenue under
non-refundable fixed-price contracts for software licenses is recognized after
the software has been delivered and all significant uncertainties regarding
customer acceptance have expired. The portion of the fixed-fee revenue related
to maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period.
25     Deferred revenues of $7183 million and $5933 million at December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively, represent billings in excess of costs and related
profits on certain contracts. Included in accounts receivable are unbilled
receivables of $9995 million and $8210 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Unbilled receivables represent costs and related profits in excess
of billings on certain fixed-price contracts. Unbilled receivables were not
billable at the balance sheet date but are recoverable over the remaining life
of the contract through billings that will be made in accordance with
contractual agreements. Of the unbilled receivables at December 31, 1999,
billings to such clients totaling $1432 million are expected to be collected in
2001 and thereafter. A specific client unbilled receivable balance may not be
directly decreased for such future years' billings because additional costs may
also be incurred in the future in accordance with the contractual agreements.
Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated at current exchange rates.
Revenue and expense accounts are translated using an average rate for the
period. Translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income,
but are reflected as a component of shareholders' equity. Cumulative currency
translation adjustment losses included in shareholders' equity were $3341
million, $1710 million and $1763 million at December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Non-functional currency transaction gains and losses, net of
income taxes, are included in determining net income and were a gain of $10
million, a loss of $85 million and a gain of $39 million, respectively, for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period
except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners. The
related tax effect allocated to each component of other comprehensive income is
as follows in millions                                                  December 31, 1999

Other comprehensive    $ 1175     $1010   $  165
For the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, reclassification
adjustments for gains losses realized in income were $150 million and $25
million, respectively, net of the related tax expense benefit of $54 million
and $09 million, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company provides for deferred taxes under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be reversed. The deferral method is used to account
for investment tax credits.
Statements of Cash Flows
The Company considers the following items with original maturities of
three months or less, to be cash equivalents: certificates of deposit,
commercial paper, repurchase agreements and money market funds.
26 Financial Instruments

estimated fair value based on current market quotes. The fair values of certain
long-term investments are estimated based on quoted market prices for these or
similar investments. For other investments, various methods are used to estimate
fair value, including external valuations and discounted cash flows. The fair
value of long-term debt and redeemable preferred stock of subsidiaries,
including related interest rate swap agreements, is estimated based on the
current rates offered to the Company for instruments with similar terms, degree
of risk and remaining maturities. The fair value of foreign exchange forward
contracts is based on the estimated amount to settle the contracts using current
market exchange rates. The carrying value of other financial instruments, such
as cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, and accounts payable,
approximates their fair value.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Because of the use of estimates inherent
in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are
limited due to the large number of clients forming the Company client base and
their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. Accounts
receivable are shown net of allowances of $952 million and $1447 million at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes compensation cost over the vesting period for
the difference between the quoted market price of an award at the date of grant
and the purchase or exercise price of the share.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of
The Company reviews its long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be
held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
27 Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1998 and 1997
consolidated financial statements to conform to the 1999 presentation.

Non-current securities are included in Investments and Other Assets
see Note 4. In addition, at December 31, 1999 and 1998, certain
available-for-sale marketable securities with carrying amounts of $4225 million
and $1973 million, including unrealized gains of $4074 million and $1034
million, respectively, were classified as Investments and Other Assets. Such
classification resulted from the Company intent to hold the securities for
greater than one year.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of current debt securities
at December 31, 1999, by contractual maturity, are shown below in millions.
Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers
of the securities may have the right to repay obligations without prepayment
penalties.

Financing leases that are financed with non-recourse borrowings at
lease inception are accounted for as leveraged leases. Such borrowings are
secured by substantially all of the lessor rights under the lease plus the
residual value of the asset. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company
receives the investment tax credit if available at lease inception and has the
benefit of tax deductions for depreciation on the leased asset and for interest
on the non-recourse debt. A portion of the Company leveraged lease portfolio
is concentrated within the airline industry. The Company historically has not
experienced credit losses from these transactions, and the portfolios are
diversified among unrelated lessees.
Investment in securities, joint ventures and partnerships includes
investments accounted for under the equity method of $464 million and $621
million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. A decline in the market
value of any investment that is deemed to be other than temporary is charged to
earnings.

Commercial paper is classified as non-current debt, as it is intended
to be maintained on a long-term basis, with ongoing credit availability provided
by the Company revolving, committed lines of credit. The Company maintains a
credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for $12 billion of
committed lines of credit, of which $6250 million expires in 2000, with the
option to convert any outstanding amounts under these lines into term loans that
mature in 2002. The remaining $6250 million expires in 2004. The Company pays
annual commitment fees of 005% to 0075% on the unused portion of the lines of
credit.
During 1999, the Company issued debt instruments in the principal
amount of $15 billion. These notes include $5000 million that bear interest at
the rate of 685% and mature in 2004, $7000 million that bear interest at the
rate of 7125% and mature in 2009, and $3000 million that bear interest at the
rate of 745% and mature in 2029. Such notes were issued to fund the repurchase
of 270 million shares of the Company common stock. See Note 12 for a
discussion of related interest rate swap agreements.
30     Maturities of long-term debt for years subsequent to December 31, 1999,
are as follows in millions

The Company credit facilities and the indentures governing its
long-term notes contain certain financial and other covenants, including the
maintenance of a minimum net worth and restrictions on mergers, consolidations
and sales of substantially all of the assets of the Company. As of December 31,
1999, the Company was in compliance with all of these covenants.
NOTE 8: REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARIES, MINORITY INTERESTS, AND
OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES
At December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, a consolidated subsidiary of the
Company had redeemable preferred stock outstanding of $1750 million. Holders of
the preferred shares have the right to redeem such shares from 2001 to 2003 for
cash equal to the issue amount plus cumulative unpaid dividends. Dividends on
such preferred shares are cumulative from the effective date of issue at fixed
rates ranging from 695% to 77%. See Note 12 for a discussion of related
interest rate swap agreements. The preferred shares are non-voting and provide
the holders with a priority position with respect to any class of the issuing
subsidiary stock in the event of dissolution. The Company may call the
redeemable preferred stock outstanding in 2003.
In June 1998, Unigraphics Solutions Inc., a then wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, sold five million shares of its Class A common stock,
representing 138% of its total outstanding common stock, in an initial public
offering. Net proceeds from the offering were $651 million. The Company
recognized a gain on the sale of stock of this subsidiary of $496 million.
Income taxes have not been provided for this gain, as the Company believes that
it will recover its basis in the shares sold in a tax-free manner.

The net changes in the total valuation allowance for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were an increase of $68 million, a decrease of
$860 million and an increase in $14 million, respectively. Certain of the
Company foreign subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards that expire
over periods through 2009 and others are unlimited. A majority of the
carryforwards with definite expiration periods are included in the valuation
allowance. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.
32 NOTE 10: STOCK PURCHASE AND INCENTIVE PLANS
Compensation cost charged against income in connection with stock plans
was $1129 million, $1562 million and $1032 million for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The difference between the
quoted market price as of the date of the grant and the purchase price of shares
is charged to operations over the vesting period. No compensation cost has been
recognized for fixed stock options with exercise prices equal to the market
price of the stock on the dates of grant and shares acquired by employees under
the EDS Stock Purchase Plan. Pro forma net income and earnings per share
disclosures, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, are computed as if the Company recorded
compensation expense based on the fair value for stock-based awards and are as
follows in millions, except per share amounts                                                   Years Ended December 31,

of each option is estimated at the date of grant using a modified Black-Scholes
option pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions for 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively: dividend yields of 12%, 15% and 16%; expected
volatility of 301%, 295% and 255%; risk-free interest rate of 53%, 51% and
64%; and expected lives of 61 years, 71 years and 78 years.
EDS Stock Purchase Plan
The EDS Stock Purchase Plan enables EDS employees to purchase up to
575 million shares of EDS common stock at 85% of the quoted market price
through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. Shares of EDS
common stock purchased under the EDS Stock Purchase Plan may not be sold or
transferred within two years of the date of purchase unless they are first
offered to EDS at the lesser of the original purchase price or the fair market
value on the date of sale. The number of shares available for future sale under
the EDS Stock Purchase Plan was 522 million shares at December 31, 1999.
PerformanceShare Plan
The PerformanceShare Plan covers up to 200 million shares of EDS
common stock and permits the granting of stock-based awards in the form of stock
options to eligible employees. The maximum number of shares for which future
options may be granted under the provisions of the PerformanceShare Plan was 46
million shares at December 31, 1999.
Incentive Plan
The Incentive Plan covers up to 770 million shares of EDS common
stock. The Incentive Plan permits the granting of stock-based awards in the form
of restricted shares, restricted stock units, stock options or stock
appreciation rights to eligible employees, officers and non-employee directors.
The exercise price for stock options has been equal to the quoted market price
on the date of the grant. The maximum number of shares for which additional
shares, rights or options may be granted or sold under the provisions of the
Incentive Plan was 250 million shares at December 31, 1999.
33     During the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, 09 million,
17 million and 52 million restricted stock units, respectively, were granted.
A restricted stock unit is the right to receive shares. Units granted are
generally scheduled to vest over a period of five to ten years. The
weighted-average fair value of the restricted stock units granted was $5577 4101 and $4292 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The quoted market price as of the date of grant is charged to
operations over the vesting period. The total unvested number of units at
December 31, 1999, was 125 million.
During 1999, in connection with the restructuring activities described
in Note 18, the Company recognized compensation expense totaling $513 million
resulting from changes to vesting conditions for unvested restricted stock units
and options pursuant to the Company officer retention plan. The plan provides
for cash benefits and accelerated vesting of restricted stock units and options
in the event of termination of employment without cause and other benefits in
the event the officer remained employed at the end of the retention period.
During 1998, the Company recognized compensation expense totaling $494
million due to the retirement of its former Chairman and Vice Chairman. Such
expense resulted from changes to vesting conditions for unvested restricted
stock units and the grant of additional supplemental executive retirement and
other cash benefits.
In 1999, 1998 and 1997, non-employee directors were granted a total of
3,452, 4,411 and 7,349 restricted shares, respectively, of EDS common stock that
vest over a three-year period. The quoted market price on the date of grant is
charged to expense over the vesting period for these shares.

exercise prices of $45 to $61 had a weighted-average remaining contractual life
and exercise price of nine years and $49, respectively.

and competitive positioning.
The Company uses gross profit, which consists of segment revenues less
cost of revenues, to measure segment profit or loss. Revenue and gross profit of
foreign operations are measured using fixed currency exchange rates with
differences between fixed and actual exchange rates being included in the all
other category. Segment gross profit excludes selling, general and
administrative expenses; restructuring charges; and asset writedowns that are
not allocated to individual segments for management reporting purposes.

1999, 1998 and 1997, total revenue from contracts with GM and its affiliates
totaled $36 billion, $36 billion and $37 billion, respectively. Revenues from
contracts with GM were reported in each of the Company reportable segments.

million and $2997 million as of December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
NOTE 12: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company operates on a global basis, receiving revenues and
incurring expenses in many countries. As a result of these activities, the
Company has exposure to market risks arising from changes in interest rates and
foreign exchange rates. Derivative financial instruments are used by the Company
for the purpose of hedging against these risks by creating offsetting market
positions. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.
The notional amounts of derivative contracts, summarized below as part
of the description of the instruments utilized, do not necessarily represent the
amounts exchanged by the parties and thus are not a measure of the exposure of
the Company resulting from its use of derivatives. The amounts exchanged by the
parties are normally calculated on the basis of the notional amounts and the
other terms of the derivatives. The Company is not a party to leveraged
derivatives. Net payments or receipts under the Company interest rate swap
agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. Gains and losses on
foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as and effective as a
hedge of a foreign currency firm commitment are deferred and included in the
measurement of the hedged transaction upon settlement. Deferred gains and losses
relating to these instruments were not material in the years ended December 31,
1999, 1998 and 1997. Gains and losses on other foreign currency forward
contracts are reflected in other income in the period in which the currency
fluctuation occurs.
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance
by counterparties to interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
However, because the Company deals only with major commercial banks with
high-quality credit ratings, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by
any of these counterparties.
Interest Risk Management
As of December 31, 1999, in connection with the debt issuance discussed
in Note 7, the Company had interest rate swaps outstanding in the notional
amount of $5000 million. Under the swaps, the Company receives a fixed rate of
7125% and pays a floating rate tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate
LIBOR, which was 625%. As of December 31, 1998, in connection with a 1997
debt issuance transaction, the Company had interest rate swaps outstanding in
the notional amount of $2000 million and paid a fixed rate of 6975% and
received a floating rate tied to the LIBOR of 634%.
In connection with the preferred stock transactions discussed in Note
8, the Company had both fixed-to-variable interest rate and currency swaps
outstanding in the notional amount of $1750 million as of December 31, 1999 and
1998. At December 31, 1999, the floating rates to pay were tied to the LIBOR and
were 564% to 609%, and the fixed rates to receive were 695% to 770%. The
related currency swaps converted the British pound LIBOR paid by the Company to
the U.S. dollar LIBOR.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, particularly foreign
exchange forward contracts, to hedge transactions denominated in different
currencies on a continuing basis. The purpose of the Company hedging
activities is to reduce the levels of risk of exposure to exchange rate
movements, most significantly in Canada, the United Kingdom, those Western
European countries who use the euro as common currency, Australia and New
Zealand. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had forward exchange
contracts maturing predominantly in the following year to purchase various
foreign currencies in the amount of $2341 million and $6789 million,
respectively, and to sell various foreign currencies in the amount of $18
billion and $16 billion, respectively.
37 NOTE 13: RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company has several qualified and non-qualified pension plans the
Plans covering substantially all its employees. The majority of the Plans are
non-contributory. In general, employees become fully vested upon attaining five
years of service, and benefits are based on years of service and earnings. The
actuarial cost method currently used is the projected unit credit cost method.
The Company U.S. funding policy is to contribute amounts that fall within the
range of deductible contributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the
Plans' benefit obligations and fair value of assets over the two-year period
ended December 31, 1999, and a statement of the funded status as of December 31

The Company has certain pension plans, primarily international plans,
with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. The accumulated
benefit obligations for these plans were $2045 million and $1785 million at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Total plan assets for these plans were
$193 million and $160 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The following table provides the components of net periodic pension

The prior-service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
average remaining service period of active participants. Gains or losses in
excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation and the market-related
value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of
active participants.
In connection with its 1999 restructuring see Note 18, the Company
recognized a charge of $1748 million for special termination benefits for
employees who accepted early retirement or were involuntarily terminated. The
Company recorded a curtailment gain of $286 million in connection with this
restructuring.
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Plans' assets consisted primarily of
equity and fixed-income securities and U.S. government obligations. During 1998,
the Company amended the U.S. pension plan to convert it to a cash balance plan,
using a benefit formula based on years of service, age and career-average
earnings. These amendments to the U.S. pension plan were effective July 1, 1998.
The impact of these amendments on the Company 1998 financial position and
results of operations was to reduce the benefit obligation by approximately
$4920 million and pension cost by $570 million, respectively.
39     The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the
Company benefit obligation are shown in the following table                                                     Years Ended December 31,

401k Plan provides a long-term savings program for participants. The 401k
Plan allows eligible employees to contribute a percentage of their compensation
to a savings program and to defer income taxes until the time of distribution.
The Company amended the 401k Plan, effective July 1, 1998, to provide for
employer-matching contributions in the form of EDS stock. During the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, employer-matching contributions totaled $339
million and $143 million, respectively.
NOTE 14: COMMITMENTS AND RENTAL EXPENSE
Commitments for rental payments for each of the next five years and
thereafter under non-cancelable operating leases for computer equipment,
software and facilities are $5483 million, $3429 million, $2889 million 2140 million, $1884 million and $5086 million.
Total rentals under cancelable and non-cancelable leases, principally
computer equipment, leased facilities, software and other leased assets,
included in costs and charged to expenses were $15 billion, $13 billion and
$10 billion for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had $635 million outstanding under
standby letters of credit related to payment and performance guarantees.
NOTE 15: CONTINGENCIES
There are various claims and pending actions against the Company
arising in the ordinary course of the conduct of its business. Certain of these
actions seek damages in significant amounts. However, the amount of liability on
claims and pending actions at December 31, 1999, was not determinable. In the
opinion of management, the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from the
aforementioned contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company consolidated results of operations or financial position.
In the normal course of business, the Company provides IT consulting
and processing services to its clients under contracts that sometimes require
the Company to comply with certain project-related performance criteria,
including project deadlines, defined IT system deliverables or level-of-effort
measurements. Under certain contracts, the Company could be required to purchase
project-related IT processing assets of its clients totaling $4498 million if
the Company does not comply with such criteria. The Company believes that it is
in compliance with the performance provisions of these contracts and that the
ultimate liability, if any, incurred under these contracts will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company consolidated results of operations or
financial position.
The Company is exposed to market risk on investments it holds in trust
on behalf of one of its customers. These investments, which consist primarily of
corporate and government bonds with maturities less than 90 days, had a market
value of $2078 million and $2285 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
40 NOTE 16: ACQUISITIONS
On April 22, 1999, the Company acquired MCI WorldCom information
technology services unit, MCI Systemhouse Systemhouse, for approximately
$16 billion in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. The excess purchase
price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired, pending final
determination of certain acquired balances, was $14 billion and is being
amortized to expense over periods ranging from five to twenty-five years.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
operations of Systemhouse since the date of acquisition. The following table is
prepared on a pro forma basis as though Systemhouse had been acquired as of
January 1, 1998, after including the estimated impact of adjustments such as
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, interest expense,
elimination of certain MCI WorldCom intercompany charges and related tax effects
unaudited; in millions, except per share amounts                                                     Years Ended December 31,

The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what would have
occurred if the acquisition had been in effect for the periods presented. In
addition, they are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not
reflect any synergies that might be achieved from combining the operations.
On March 2, 1998, the Company subsidiary, Unigraphics Solutions Inc.,
acquired the Mechanical CAD/CAM business of Intergraph Corporation the Solid
Edge Acquisition for a purchase price of $1050 million excluding
approximately $20 million of acquisition costs, in a transaction accounted for
as a purchase. The cost of the Solid Edge Acquisition was allocated to
identifiable assets based on estimated fair values. Costs allocated to
in-process research and development in the amount of $425 million were expensed
upon acquisition. The remaining purchase price of $645 million was assigned to
the various intangible assets and is being amortized over periods of two to
seven years.
On August 29, 1997, EDS acquired all remaining outstanding equity
interests in Neodata Corporation Neodata, a Colorado-based integrated
marketing communications services company, for $617 million, net of cash
acquired, in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. The excess purchase
price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was $2605
million and is being amortized to expense over periods ranging from three to
twenty years. Prior to August 29, 1997, the Company investment in Neodata,
which was first made in 1993, was accounted for under the cost method. With the
acquisition of the remaining outstanding equity interests of Neodata,
preacquisition losses for years prior to 1997 of $358 million were charged to
retained earnings.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
operations of Neodata and Solid Edge since the dates of acquisition. Pro forma
disclosure relating to such acquisitions is not presented, as the impact is
immaterial to EDS.
The Company made various other acquisitions during the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, none of which had a material effect on the
Company financial position or results of operations during the periods
presented. In conjunction with the aforementioned acquisitions, assets acquired
and liabilities assumed for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 are
summarized as follows in millions                                                   Years Ended December 31,

Beginning in the first quarter of 1999, the Company began the
implementation of initiatives designed to reduce costs, streamline its
organizational structure and exit certain operating activities. As a result of
these initiatives, the Company recorded restructuring charges and related asset
writedowns totaling $1,0677 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Amounts recorded for restructuring activities during 1999 provide for planned
workforce reductions of approximately 15,300 employees, consisting of
approximately 3,200 employees who accepted the Company early retirement offer
and the involuntary termination of approximately 12,100 individuals employed
throughout the Company in managerial, professional, clerical, consulting and
technical positions. Total involuntary termination and early retirement offer
charges amounted to $8665 million, $1462 million of which pertains to a
curtailment gain and special termination benefits related to the early
retirement offers, including amounts under the Company defined benefit pension
plan see Note 13, and $513 million from changes to the vesting conditions for
unvested restricted stock units and options see Note 10. In addition, these
initiatives have resulted in the exit of certain business activities, the
consolidation of facilities and the writedown of certain assets to net
realizable value. Charges associated with these actions include $939 million
relating to business exit and facilities consolidation costs, and asset
writedowns of $1073 million. The accrual for business exit activities and
consolidation of facilities includes estimated costs of $155 million to
terminate software license agreements, $396 million to terminate certain
leases, $168 million to terminate certain customer contracts and $220 million
for other costs. These costs are associated with the exit of several lines of
business, primarily within systems
42 and technology services. Asset writedowns related to the restructuring
activities consist of $578 million to write-off software, goodwill and other
intangibles, and $495 million for writedowns of computer-related equipment and
other assets. Such asset writedowns, which predominantly related to businesses
that the Company has decided to exit in the systems and technology, business
process management and consulting lines of business, were primarily determined
based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows.
As of December 31, 1999, approximately 7,400 employees have left the
Company through involuntary termination as a result of the 1999 initiatives, and
approximately $2589 million of termination benefits have been charged to the
accrual. In addition, approximately $350 million has been paid in connection
with the exit activities described above. The Company expects that remaining
cash expenditures relating to this charge will be incurred primarily in 2000.
The reversal of the residual accruals of $294 million in 1999 resulted
primarily from the reversal of excess termination benefit accruals.
During 1997, the Company implemented an enterprisewide business
transformation initiative to reduce its costs, streamline its organizational
structure and align its strategy, services and delivery with market
opportunities. This initiative involved the elimination of approximately 8,500
positions through reassignment of personnel, elimination of open personnel
requisitions, normal attrition and termination of employees. As a result of this
initiative, the Company recorded restructuring charges totaling $1253 million,
primarily relating to the severance costs associated with the planned
involuntary termination of approximately 2,600 employees. In addition, the
Company recorded asset writedowns of $997 million relating to operations that
the Company discontinued. These operations primarily consisted of several
processing centers that the Company consolidated and certain product lines and
related services provided to certain industries. Asset writedowns relating to
these product lines included investments; software, goodwill and other
intangibles; and buildings and computer equipment. The Company also recorded
asset writedowns of $1046 million in 1997 and $278 million in 1998 primarily
relating to operating assets initially identified for sale in 1997. As of
December 31, 1998, all such assets had been sold.
Restructuring activities in 1996 and 1997 resulted in the involuntary
termination of approximately 4,750 employees and the acceptance by approximately
1,750 employees of early retirement offers. These restructuring activities have
resulted in cash expenditures of $2744 million since the beginning of the
second quarter of 1996. The restructuring actions contemplated under the 1996
and 1997 plans are essentially complete as of December 31, 1999, with remaining
restructuring reserves comprised primarily of future severance-related payments
to terminated employees, future lease payments for exited facilities and
accruals for other restructuring activities.
Costs allocated to in-process research and development in the amount of
$425 million in connection with the Solid Edge Acquisition were expensed in
1998 see Note 16. The in-process research and development related to the
modification of certain CAD/CAM software, known as Solid Edge Version 40, to
include the Unigraphics' Parasolid solid modeling kernel software. This project
commenced in July 1997 and was completed in May 1998. Initial sales of the
resulting product, Solid Edge Version 50, occurred shortly thereafter. The
value assigned to in-process research and development was determined based on
management estimates of the remaining costs to develop the in-process
technology e.g., Solid Edge Version 50 into a commercially viable product,
the estimated future net cash flows from Solid Edge Version 50 and the
discounting of such cash flows back to their present value.
