Resources, Inc and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December31, 2007 Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Significant
Accounting Policies Organization BPZ Resources,Inc.,
the Company or BPZ a Texas corporation, is based in Houston, Texas with
offices in Lima, Peru and Quito, Ecuador. The Company is focused on the
exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas in Peru and
Ecuador. It also intends to utilize part of our planned future natural gas
production as a supply source for the complementary development of a Company
owned gas-fired power generation facility. The Company maintains a
subsidiary registered in Peru through our wholly owned subsidiary BPZ Energy,Inc.,
a Texas corporation BPZ Texas. Currently, BPZ Energy has exclusive rights
and license agreements for oil and gas exploration and production covering a
total of approximately 24 million acres, in four blocks, in northwest Peru.
The Companys license contracts cover 100% ownership of Block Z-1 739,205
acres, Block XIX 472,860 acres, Block XXII 948,000 acres, also referred to
as Area VI in previous filings and Block XXIII 248,000 acres. The Block Z-1
contract was signed in November2001, the Block XIX contract was signed in
December2003 and Blocks XXII and XXIII were both signed in November2007. The Companys license contracts provide for
an initial exploration period of seven to thirteen years for Block Z-1and seven
to ten years for Blocks XIX, XXII and XXIII.
In addition, they require that the Company conduct specified activities
on the properties during this period. If the exploration activities are
successful, the total contract term can extend up to 30 years for oil
exploration and production and up to 40 years for gas exploration and
production. Through its wholly owned
subsidiary, SMC Ecuador Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its registered branch
in Ecuador, the Company owns a 10% non-operated working interest in an oil and
gas producing property, Block 2, located in the southwest region of Ecuador
the Santa Elena Property. The license agreement covering the property
extends through May2016. The Company is in the
initial stages of developing its oil and natural gas reserves and has recently
begun producing oil under an extended well testing program from our recent
discoveries. To date its activities in Peru
have been primarily limited to analysis and evaluation of technical data on the
properties and preparation of the development plans for the properties,
including detailed engineering and design of the power plant and gas processing
facilities, refurbishment of two of our offshore platforms, procuring machinery
and equipment for an extended drilling campaign, obtaining all necessary
environmental and operating permits procuring development equipment and
securing the required capital and financing to conduct the current plan of
operation. In March2007, after a
total of six drill stem tests were conducted on separate potential pay zones
from the Lower and Upper Zorritos formations, the CX11-21 XD well, the Companys
first well, tested positive for both gas and oil at commercially producible
quantities. Subsequently, in June2007
the Company successfully recompleted the Corvina CX11-16X well as a natural gas
producing well and completed a total of four drill stem tests on various zones
in the well including one in a formation previously untested in the entire
basin. In October, we completed seven
drill stem tests on the CX1114D well in the Corinva Field. The CX11-14D well tested positive for both
gas and oil at commercially producible quantities. The first six tests were conducted in the
Upper Zorritos formation, with the first two testing the oil zone and the other
four testing the gas zone, while the seventh test targeted the Cardalitos
formation located immediately above the Upper Zorritos. On November29, 2007, BPZ commenced
drilling on the CX11-18XD well. The well
reached total depth of 8,792 feet measured depth on January1, 2008,
approximately one month ahead of schedule.
The Company recently performed a series of safety and integrity tests on
the CX-11 Corvina platform including the surface equipment. As part of the integrity testing of the
service equipment, it perforated the lower prospective oil sands identified in
the CX11-18XD well. These lower sands
tested oil and the results assisted in validating the Companys Corvina
geologic model. The Company started
producing oil from the CX11 platform under an extended well testing program
beginning on November1, 2007. By December31,
2007, it produced approximately 40,989 barrels of oil and sold approximately
28,741 barrels to a refinery in Talara.
The oil is delivered to the refinery by barge approximately 100 miles
south of the platform. The remainder was
kept in production inventory until such time it was delivered to Talara in
early 2008. 50 Prior to December2007,
the Company had no significant revenues and was considered an exploratory stage
company. However, in December2007,
the Company delivered 28,741 barrels of oil.
As a result, the Company is no longer considered an exploratory stage
company as of December31, 2007. On June13, 2007, the Company entered into a capital
lease agreement, with an option to purchase, for two barges to assist in
the development of the Corvina Field. The two barges were towed to Peru where
one barge, the Nu uanu, is currently being used to transport oil between the
CX11 platform and the refinery in Talara, approximately 100 miles south. The other barge, the Nomoku, is currently
being fitted with the required equipment for its intended use as a floating
production, storage and offloading facility FPSO that will be moored next
to the CX11 platform. However, we have
encountered some delays in deploying this barge due to scheduling. The Company expects the Nomoku to be fully
fitted and operational by the end of the first or beginning of the second
quarter of 2008. Until such time the
Nomoku is fitted with the permanent production equipment, the Company is anticipating
pumping oil directly to the Nu uanu using temporary production equipment and
then transporting the oil to the Talara refinery. On October24, 2007,
the Companys primary marine transportation contractor entered into two short
term agreements with the commercial division of the Peruvian Navy to lease two
tankers to transport oil to market. However, on January30, 2008, one of
the tankers sank after catching fire.
Consequently, through its primary marine transportation contractor, the
Company is now leasing only one vessel from the Navy having a capacity of
approximately 6,000 barrels. The lease
is set to expire at the end of March2008. Currently all production
which had reached approximately 4,200 barrels of oil per day by late January
2008 is shut-in due to the incident involving the Navy tanker. At the
request of the OSINERGMIN, the government agency responsible for auditing the
safety of energy investments in Peru, we successfully performed a series of
safety and integrity tests on the facilities at the CX-11 Corvina platform, including
the equipment that was being used for the ongoing long-term testing of the 21XD
and 14D wells. We confirmed that the well testing equipment was in
operational condition. On March 12, 2008 we received clearance from the
OSINERGMIN, to resume operations at the CX-11 platform, including the scheduled
18XD well drill stem test. However, the four Corvina wells are currently
shut-in while we complete the installation of sea-bed pipelines connecting the
platform to the transport barge, along with the required mooring systems, that
will allow for an improved long-term testing program. Additionally, we are waiting
for final clarification from the appropriate authorities in Peru regarding the
transportation of our crude oil to the refinery. The Company has submitted
all the requested reports and documentation generated during the investigation
of the January30, 2008 sinking of the Peruvian Navy tanker, Supe. A number of organizations involved in the
investigation have issued reports concluding there was no environmental damage
due to the incident. Additionally, the
Company assisted the Peruvian Navy in conducting an underwater survey of the
Supe, which established that the vessel does not represent a hazard to navigation
nor a marine pollution threat, as all its tanks were found to be empty. The CX-11 Corvina platform and all its
facilities, as well as the BPZ-01 tender barge, the four Corvina wells, and all
the vessels supporting the operations have now been certified to be in
operational condition. Reincorporation, Name Change and Internal
Restructuring On October11, 2007,
BPZ Energy,Inc., a Colorado corporation, formerly named Navidec,Inc.,
Navidec, completed a reincorporation from the State of Colorado to the
State of Texas pursuant to the Plan of Conversion as approved by the
shareholders at the 2007 annual meeting of shareholders held on August17,
2007. The related filings with the Secretary of State of Texas also included a
change of the companys name from BPZ Energy,Inc. to BPZ Resources,Inc.,
in connection with an ongoing review of certain internal reorganization matters
related to our international tax planning and corporate structure. The Company
continues to do business under the name BPZ Energy in its regular business
operations. No changes to the members
of the Board of Directors, the management, or the operations of the Company
were made in connection with the reincorporation from a Colorado corporation to
a Texas corporation. The Company remains the same business entity following the
reincorporation to Texas, with all of the assets, rights, privileges and powers
of, and all property owned by, all debts due to, as well as any other causes of
action belonging to the predecessor Colorado entity. As part of the
reincorporation, a new Certificate of Formation and new Bylaws were adopted,
and now govern the rights of holders of the Companys common stock. At the
effective time of the reincorporation, each outstanding share of the Colorado
entity prior to the reincorporation was automatically converted into one share
of the Texas entity. As part of the
restructuring, we have created two British Virgin Island limited partnership
holding companies for various BPZ entities.
Each holding company is owned 90% by BPZ Energy, Inc. as general partner
and, in compliance with local requirements, 10% by an individual nominee
limited partner, one of whom is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Although 10% of each of the holding companies
is nominally owned by an individual, these individuals have agreed to enter
into nominee agreements to assign all associated economic interest back to us,
and consequently we treat these subsidiary holding companies and their
subsidiaries as wholly-owned for accounting purposes. By the time we complete the restructuring, we
intend to replace the individual nominees with another wholly-owned subsidiary
to serve as limited partner of the holding companies. Navidec Merger Transaction On September10,
2004, BPZ Energy,Inc., a Texas BPZ-Texas corporation consummated a
reverse merger with Navidec,whereby BPZ-Texas became a wholly owned
subsidiary of Navidec the Merger. As a result of the Merger, the
shareholders of BPZ-Texas received the majority of the voting interest and
control of the Board of Directors and management 51 of the combined entity.
For accounting purposes, BPZ-Texas was treated as the acquiring entity. All
financial statements herein represent the historical financial statements of
the accounting acquirer, BPZ Texas. See BusinessNavidec Merger Transaction
for detailed discussion regarding the Merger. On February4, 2005, Navidec
changed its name to BPZ Energy,Inc. Although the Companys name has been
changed, the pre-merger company may be referred to as Navidec in this filing,
as the context may require, to avoid confusion. The Merger Agreement
provided for the immediate issuance by Navidec of 9,000,000 shares of its
common stock to the shareholders of BPZ-Texas and the future issuance of an
additional 18,000,000 shares on an earn-out basis if the Company achieved
certain reserve and production goals. The first 9,000,000 earn-out shares were
contingent on achieving certain reserve targets, which were achieved in December2004.
The remaining 9,000,000 earn-out shares were contingent on the Company becoming
entitled to receive as its proportionate share from gross production from any
oil and gas wells owned or operated by the Company not less than 2,000 barrels
of oil per day or its equivalent approximately 12 million cubic feet of gas
per day prior to December28, 2007.
In November2007 this production target was achieved based on
certification by an independent engineering firm that the Companys production
in Peru has met or exceeded the required level of production. For accounting purposes, the earn-out arrangement is
treated as a stock dividend because the earn-out is payable to the shareholders
of the accounting acquirer, BPZ-Texas as contingent merger consideration.
Accordingly, except for a retroactive increase in the number of common shares
outstanding for all periods presented, no accounting entry is required upon the
issuance of the earn-out shares. Basis of Presentation and
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries and branch offices.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Companys accounting policy regarding partnership
or joint venture interests in oil and gas properties is to consolidate such
interests on a pro-rata basis in accordance with accepted practice in the oil
and gas industry. However, the Company has not been able to receive timely
information to allow it to proportionately consolidate the minority
non-operated working interest owned by its consolidated subsidiary, SMC Ecuador
Inc. See Note 6 Investment in Ecuador Property and Note Payable to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Companys
investment in its Ecuador property. Accordingly, the Company accounts for this
investment under the cost method. As such, the Company records its share of
cash received or paid attributable to this investment as other income or
expense. Revenue Recognition The
Company does not recognize revenues until they are realized or realizable and
earned. Revenues are considered realized or realizable and earned when: ipersuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, iidelivery has occurred or services
have been rendered, iiithe sellers price to the buyer is fixed or
determinable and ivcollectibility is reasonably assured. The Company sells its production in the Peruvian
domestic market on a contract basis.
Revenue is recorded net of royalties when the purchaser takes delivery
of the oil. At the end of the period,
oil that has been produced but not sold is recorded as inventory at the lower
of cost or market. Cost is determined on
a weighted average based on production costs. Reporting and Functional Currency The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency for our
operations in both Peru and Ecuador. Ecuador has adopted the U.S. Dollar as its
official currency. Peru, however, uses its local currency, Nuevo Soles, in
addition to the U.S. Dollar and therefore our financial results are subject to
foreign currency gains and losses. We have adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No52, Foreign Currency Translation,
which requires that the translation of the applicable foreign currency into
U.S. dollars be performed for balance sheet monetary accounts using current
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, non-monetary accounts using
historical exchange rates in effect at the time the transaction occurs, and for
revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the
period reported. Accordingly, the gains or losses resulting from such
translation are included in other income and expense in the consolidated
statements of operations. Due to the relatively low level of activity to-date
and the relatively steady exchange rate in Peru, a translation gain of
approximately $190,000 was recognized during the year ended December31,
2007 and a translation gain $56,000 was recognized during the year ended December31,
2006. The primary reason for the
translation difference related to the early recovery of Value Added Tax in Peru
IGV, which by Peruvian law must be transacted and accounted for in the
local currency. 52 Use
of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates
and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses in the consolidated financial statements, and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Cash
and Cash Equivalents The Company considers cash on hand, cash in banks,
money market mutual funds and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Certain of
the Companys cash balances are maintained in foreign banks which are not covered
by deposit insurance. The cash balance in the Companys U.S. bank accounts may
exceed federally insured limits. Restricted
Cash As discussed in Note 7, Restricted Cash contained
herein under notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has
secured various performance bonds, collateralized primarily by certificates of
deposit, to guarantee its obligations and commitments in connection with its
exploratory properties in Peru. All of the performance bonds have been issued
by Peruvian banks and their terms are dictated by the corresponding License
Contract or Agreement. Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts Currently, the Companys
contract terms regarding oil sales have a relatively short settlement
period. However, the Company regularly
reviews all aged accounts receivables for collectability and establishes an
allowance as necessary for balances greater than 90 days outstanding. Currently all receivables are current or were
outstanding less than thirty days. It is
the Companys belief that there are no balances in accounts receivable that
will not be collected and that an allowance was not necessary at December31,
2007. There was no receivable balance as
of December31, 2006. Property,
Equipment and Construction in Progress The Company follows the successful efforts method of
accounting of its costs of acquisition, exploration and development of oil and
gas properties. Under this method, oil and gas lease acquisition costs and
intangible drilling costs associated with exploration efforts that result in
the discovery of proved reserves and costs associated with development
drilling, whether or not successful, are capitalized when incurred. Certain
costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determinations that proved
reserves have been found. If the determination is dependent upon the results of
planned additional wells and required capital expenditures to produce the
reserves found, the drilling costs will be capitalized as long as sufficient
reserves have been found to justify completion of the exploratory well and
additional wells are underway or firmly planned to complete the evaluation of
the well. All costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed when
such wells are determined to be non-productive or at the one year anniversary
of completion of the well if proved reserves have not been attributed and
capital expenditures as described in the preceding sentence are not required. The Company assesses its capitalized exploratory wells
pending evaluation each quarter to determine whether costs should remain
capitalized or should be charged to earnings. Other exploration costs,
including geological, geophysical and engineering costs, are expensed as
incurred. The Company recognizes gains or losses on the sale of properties,
should they occur, on a field-by-field basis. Projects under construction are not depreciated or
amortized until placed in service. For assets we construct, we capitalize
direct costs, such as labor and materials, and indirect costs, such as overhead
and interest. As of December31, 2007, property and equipment consists of
office equipment, vehicles and leasehold improvements made to the Companys
offices. All such values are stated at cost and are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets which is
ranges between three and five years, or the term of the lease. Barges and
related equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the asset which is between fifteen and twenty years. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. Replacements, upgrades or expenditures which improve and extend the
life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are sold, retired or otherwise
disposed, the applicable costs and accumulated depreciation and amortization
are removed from the appropriate accounts and the resulting gain or loss is
recorded. 53 Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability
of the carrying value of its long-lived assets, goodwill and identifiable
intangibles by monitoring and evaluating changes in circumstances that may
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Examples
of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the recoverability of
the carrying amount of an asset should be assessed include but are not limited
to the following: a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a
significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a
significant physical change in an asset, a significant adverse change in legal
factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, an accumulation of costs significantly
in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset,
and/or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of
operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates
continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing
revenue. The Company considers historical performance and
anticipated future results in its evaluation of potential impairment.
Accordingly, when indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates
the carrying value of these assets in relation to the operating performance of
the business and future discounted and non-discounted cash flows expected to
result from the use of these assets. Impairment losses are recognized when the expected
future cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying value. Stock
Based Compensation On January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123
Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, which
establishes accounting for stock-based payment transactions for employee
services and goods and services received from non-employees. SFAS 123Ris
a revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123, and supersedes APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under the provisions
of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant,
based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense
over the employees or non-employees service period, which is generally the
vesting period of the equity grant. Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted
for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123. As allowed under SFAS 123, the Company
accounted for its stock-based compensation to employees using the intrinsic
value method of accounting which bases compensation expense on the difference
between the quoted market price of the award at the measurement date less the
amount, if any, the employee is required to pay for the stock. As of December31, 2005, stock-based
awards to employees consisted of only restricted shares valued using the market
price of the Companys traded common stock on the date of grant. The fair value
method used to value restricted shares would have yielded the same fair value
and compensation expense as the intrinsic value method used; thus, no pro forma
results of operations are required to be presented. Capitalized Interest Certain
interest costs have been capitalized as part of the cost of oil and gas
properties under development, including wells in progress and related
facilities. Total interest costs
capitalized during the year ended December31, 2007 was $09 million. No interest was capitalized during the years
ended December31, 2006 and 2005 due to the lack of operational debt
during those periods. Income
Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the
liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis
of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and
laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amount expected to be realized. Environmental The Company is subject to environmental laws and
regulations of various U.S. and international jurisdictions. These laws and
regulations, which are subject to change, regulate the discharge of materials
into the environment and may require the Company to remove or mitigate the
environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical
substances at various sites. 54 Environmental costs that relate to current operations
are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Costs are expensed when they relate
to an existing condition caused by past operations and will not contribute to
current or future revenue generation. Liabilities related to environmental
assessments and/or remedial efforts are accrued when property or services are
provided and when such costs can be reasonably estimated. Loss
per Common Share In accordance with provisions of SFAS No128,
Earnings per Share, basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods.
Diluted earnings per share is computed based upon the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding plus the assumed issuance of common shares for all
potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share equals basic
earnings per share for the periods presented because the effects of potentially
dilutive securities are antidilutive. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Share
Based Payments. On December21,
2007, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin, SAB 110 Share-Based
Payment which will no longer allow the use of the Simplified method to
estimate the expected terms as on the variables to determine the fair value of
share-based payments. With a limited
number of exceptions, companies can continue to use the simplified method. However, doing so requires the types of
grants for which the Simplified method is used if not for all grants, and the
periods for which the Simplified method is being used. The adoption of this Staff Accounting
Bulletin is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Fair Value Measurements. In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157,Fair
Value Measurements, which addresses how companies should measure fair value
when companies are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or
disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. As
a result of SFAS 157, there is now a common definition of fair value to be used
throughout GAAP. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within
those years. Although the disclosure requirements may be expanded where certain
assets or liabilities are fair valued such as those related to stock
compensation expense and hedging activities, the Company does not expect the
adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February2007,
the FASB issued SFAS 159, The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment
of FASB Statement No115, which will become effective on January1,
2008. FAS 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial
liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument
basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under
other generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement
election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded
in earnings. The Company will adopt this statement in the first quarter of 2008
and it does not expect to elect the fair value option for any eligible
financial instruments and other items. Business
Combinations In December2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations, which replaces FASB Statement No141.
SFAS 141Restablishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer
recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non- controlling interest in the
acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141Ralso establishes
disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and
financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141Ris effective
for acquisitions that occur in an entitys fiscal year that begins after December15,
2008, which will be the companys fiscal year 2009. The Company does not expect
the adoption of SFAS No141R to have a material impact on the our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 55 Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. In December2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No51.
SFAS 160 requires that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be
recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of
equity. SFAS 160 also establishes reporting requirements that provide
sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the
interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS
160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements,
except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that
have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that
deconsolidate a subsidiary. This statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2008.The Company does not expect
the adoption of SFAS No160 to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Note 2 Value Added Tax
Receivable Value-added tax referred to as IGV
in Peru is generally imposed on goods and services at a rate of 19%. Peru
currently has an IGV early recovery program for companies during the
exploration phase. Under this program, IGV paid on the acquisition of certain
goods and services used directly in hydrocarbon exploration activities can be
recovered prior to a commercial discovery taking place or production and
revenue billings begin. Because the Company has oil sales, it is no longer
eligible for the IGV early recovery program. The
Companys value added tax receivable balance as of December31, 2007 was
$75 million. Of this balance, the Company has filed claims with the Peruvian
tax authority to recover approximately $29 million under the IGV early
recovery program. During the year ended, December31, 2007 the Company
accrued approximately $114 million for IGV related to expenditures during the
year and offset IGV by approximately $05 million related to the sale of oil in
December2007. Approximately $66
million of IGV has been collected during the year ended December31, 2007. During the year ended December31,
2006 the Company received a refund of approximately $22 million under the IGV
early recovery program. The Companys
value added tax receivable balance as of December31, 2006 was $32
million. Note 3 Inventory Inventories consist
primarily of tubular goods, accessories and spare parts for production
equipment, stated at the lower of average cost or market. The balance associated with tubular goods,
accessories and spare parts inventory at December31, 2007 and 2006 was
$28 million and $20 million, respectfully. The Company also maintains crude oil inventories in storage barges.
These inventories are also stated at the lower of average cost or market value.
Cost is determined on a weighted average basis based on production costs. The product inventory at December31,
2007 consisted of approximately 12,248 barrels of crude oil at an estimated
cost of $548,391 or $4477 per barrel.
There was no product inventory as of December31, 2006. Note

related to the Companys operations as well as general liability and directors
and officers insurance policies. Additional coverage was procured in response
to increased business activity for the year ended December 56 31, 2007.Insurance receivable is
related to the barge incident which occurred in early August2006. The
Company incurred an operational delay of approximately three weeks resulting
from a navigation incident which caused the BPZ-01 barge to be grounded on a
sand bank in Talara Bay in northwest Peru during the second mobilization trip
to the Corvina platform. As of December31, 2007, a claim of approximately
$712,000 for repairs is expected to be filed with the insurance carrier. A
deductible of $100,000 will be applied to this insurance claim when reimbursed.

During the year ended December31,
2007, the Company incurred costs of $631 million associated with its
development initiatives for the exploration and production of natural oil and
gas reserves and the complementary development of proprietary gas-fired power
generation for sale in Peru. The Company is in the initial stages of developing its
oil and natural gas reserves and it has begun producing oil under an extended
well testing program from its recent discoveries. To date our activities in Peru have been
primarily limited to analysis and evaluation of technical data on the
properties and preparation of the development plans for the properties,
including detailed engineering and design of the power plant and gas processing
facilities, refurbishment of two of our offshore platforms, procuring machinery
and equipment for an extended drilling campaign, obtaining all necessary
environmental and operating permits and securing the required capital and
financing to complete the current plan of operation. In March2007, after a total of
six drill stem tests were conducted on separate potential pay zones from the Lower
and Upper Zorritos formations, the CX11-21 XD well, our first well, tested
positive for both gas and oil in quantities that we believe to be commercially
producible. Subsequently, in June2007
we successfully recompleted the Corvina CX11-16X well as a natural gas
producing well and completed a total of four drill stem tests on various zones
in the well including one in a formation previously untested in the entire
basin. In October, we completed seven
drill stem tests on the CX1114D well in the Corinva Field. The CX11-14D well tested positive for both
gas and oil at commercially producible quantities. The first six tests were conducted in the
Upper Zorritos Formation, with the first two testing the oil zone and the other
four testing the gas zone, while the seventh test targeted the Cardalitos
formation located immediately above the Upper Zorritos. On November29, 2007, drilling commenced
on the CX11-18XD well. The well reached
total depth of 8,792 feet measured depth on January1, 2008, approximately
one month ahead of schedule. The
Company recently performed a series of safety and integrity tests on the CX-11
Corvina platform including the surface equipment. As part of the integrity testing of the
surface equipment, it perforated the lower prospective oil sands identified in
the CX11-18XD well. The lower sands
tested oil and the results assisted in validating our Corvina geologic model. In conjunction with the gas-to-power project, the recent
discovery of oil reserves in the Corvina field has prompted the Company to
simultaneously direct its attention towards accelerating the development of
potential oil production in the Corvina field. On June13, 2007, the
Company entered into a capital lease agreement, with an option to
purchase, for two barges to assist in the development of the Corvina oil. The
two barges were towed to Peru where they are being fitted with the required
equipment for their intended use. One of these barges will be moored next to
the CX11 platform, and will act as a floating production, storage and
offloading facility FPSO for oil produced from the Corvina field. The
Company has also identified and placed orders for the necessary oil production
facilities to be installed on the FPSO barge. The second barge will be used to
offload the produced oil from the FPSO and transport it to a refinery located
approximately 100 miles to the south in the port of Talara. The capital lease for the
two barges began in August2007 and expires in November2009. 57 Lease payments are variable based on the working status of
the barges with a purchase option of $50 million after the first year of the
lease and $40 million after the maturity date of the lease. The assets will be
depreciated over the term of the capital lease obligation. The capital
lease assets were recorded at $62 million, which represents the present value
of the minimum lease payments, or the aggregate fair market value of the
assets. See
Note 9 Debt, included herein, for further discussion. The Company began producing from the 21XD and the 14D wells
under an extended well testing program.
As a result, the costs associated with both wells, approximately $559
million was transferred from construction in progress to producing properties. In addition, the Company incurred
costs for office equipment and leasehold improvements for its offices in
Houston, Peru and Ecuador. In accordance with successful efforts method of
accounting, the Company capitalized $474,378 of depreciation expense related to
support equipment to construction in progress as well as capitalized interest
of approximately $930,786 to construction in progress during the year ended December31,
2007. Note
6 Investment in Ecuador Property and Note Payable The Company has a 10% net investment interest in an
oil and gas property in Ecuador the Santa Elena Property totaling $16
million and $18 million as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The Company accounts for this investment under the cost method and records its
share of cash received or paid as other income or expense. Since the Companys
investment represents ownership of an oil and gas property, which is a
depleting asset, the Company is amortizing the cost of the investment on a straight-line
basis over the remaining term of the license agreement which expires in May2016.
Accordingly, the Company recorded amortization expense of $187,584 in each of
the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006. Note
7 Restricted Cash In connection with its properties in Peru, the Company has
obtained five performance bonds totaling $60 million to insure certain
obligations and commitments, of which one relates to a guarantee under a
service contract and four relate to performance obligations under the license
contracts for Blocks Z-1, XIX, XXII and XXIII. As of December31,
2007, the Company
secured a $10
million performance bond to guarantee payment under a service agreement. The bond
expired in January2008 at which time the cash was refunded. Accordingly the amount was recorded as a
current asset at December31, 2007. Additionally,
as of December31, 2007, the Company had restricted cash deposits of $28 million, which partially collateralizes the performance bonds
under the License Contracts. In addition to the cash collateral posted by the
Company, an individual shareholder of the Company had provided a guarantee in
the amount of $200,000 to the financial institution that issued one of the
bonds to secure the Companys performance. During 2004, the Company
issued 236,528 shares to that individual investor for $119,175 of cash proceeds
and a subscription receivable of $230,825 for the guarantee. During the year ended December31, 2007, the
guarantee was replaced by a deposit of an additional $95,000 by the Company to
the same financial institution and the Company received the $230,825 cash
proceeds related to the subscription receivable. See, Note 14 Commitment and Contingencies below for
further details of our performance bonds obligation. All of the performance bonds were issued by Peruvian
banks and their terms are governed by the corresponding license contract or
technical evaluation agreement. Note
8 Asset Retirement Obligation An obligation was recorded for the
plug and abandonment of the producing oil wells, the 21XD and the 14D, in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations ARO. See Note 14 Commitments
and Contingencies, included herein, for further discussion. 58 Activity related to the Companys asset retirement

Note
9 Debt The recent
discovery of oil reserves in the Corvina field has prompted the Company to direct
its attention towards accelerating the development of potential oil production
in the Corvina field. On June13, 2007 the Company entered into a capital
lease agreement, with an option to purchase, for two barges to assist in the
development of the Corvina oil. The capital lease for the two barges began in August2007
and expires in November2009. The lease contains a purchase option which
the Company anticipates, for accounting purposes, it will exercise on the 15th
month of the lease term. Lease payments are variable, based on the working
status of the barges, with a purchase option of $5 million after the first year
of the lease and $4 million after the maturity date of the lease. The capital
lease obligation was recorded at the present value of the minimum lease
payments at an imputed discount rate of 18%, which reflects the Companys
incremental borrowing rate for this transaction. The capital lease obligation
was recorded at $62 million, which represents the present value of the minimum
lease payments, or the fair market value of the debt obligation. In addition, on December31,
2007, the Company had long-term debt of approximately $155 million compared to
$55,000 in long-term debt as of December31, 2006. The difference in long-term debt is related
to the IFC convertible debt. On November19,
2007, a convertible debt agreement between IFC and the Company was entered into
for approximately $155 million. The
terms of the loan agreement stipulate a conversion price of $1039 per share
and includes a forced convert price of $1819 per share, based on the average
closing price over twenty consecutive business days. The instrument has a 10
year term with a variable interest rate of 2% per annum above 6-month LIBOR
6863% at December31, 2007. The
loan from the IFC is unsecured, but restricts our ability to pledge assets to
another lender unless certain conditions are met. The IFC loan does not
restrict our ability to issue additional capital stock, but does call for an
adjustment in its conversion price into BPZ common stock based on the terms of
any subsequent equity offering. The agreement contains customary default
and cross-default provisions along with covenants restricting our ability to
pay dividends and the disposition of assets. We are required to maintain
a required ratio of Balance Sheet Liabilities to Tangible Net Worth as defined
in the Loan Agreement, calculated quarterly, of no greater than 70:30.
As of December31, 2007, we were in compliance with all financial
covenants. Long-term debt for
both 2007 and 2006 also includes two secured loans for the purchase of office
furniture. Both loans have a term of 60 months, bearing interest at 594% and
944%, with principal and interest payments due on a monthly basis. Maturities of debt

On January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123
Revised 2004, ShareBased Payment SFAS No123R,
which establishes accounting for stock-based payment transactions for employee
services and goods and services received from non-employees. SFAS No123Ris
a revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and supersedes APB No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees. Under the provisions of SFAS No123R,
stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant, based on the
calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the
employees or non-employees service period, which is generally the vesting
period of the equity grant. Prior to January1,
2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with
SFAS No123.
As allowed under SFAS No123,
the Company accounted for its stock-based compensation to employees using the
intrinsic value method of accounting which bases compensation expense on the
difference between the quoted market price of the award at the measurement date
less the amount, if any, the employee is required to pay for the stock. As of January1,
2006, stock-based awards to employees consisted of only restricted shares
valued using the market price of the Companys traded common stock on the date
of grant. The fair value method used to value restricted shares would have
yielded the same fair value and compensation expense as the intrinsic value
method used; thus, no pro forma results of operations are required to be
presented. In addition, stock-based
awards to non-employees as of January1, 2006 consisted of options and
restricted shares issued in exchange for various legal and investment banking
services. Equity instruments issued to non-employees for services were
accounted for at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value for awards
issued to non-employees was measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Expenses determined for employees and non-employees were recognized 60 in the Companys
financial statements over the applicable service period. The Company adopted SFAS No123Rusing
the modified prospective application method and, accordingly, no prior periods
have been restated as a result of the adoption of this pronouncement. Under
this method, compensation cost recognized during the year ended December31,
2006 included: acompensation cost for all stock-based payments granted
prior to, but not yet vested as of January1, 2006, based on the
grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFAS No123; and bcompensation cost for all stock-based payments
granted on or after January1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value
estimated in accordance with SFAS No123R. SFAS No123Rrequires
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures. Currently, the Companys
forfeiture estimates are 15% for both stock options and restricted stock
grants as a result of adopting SFAS No123R. The following table summarizes stock-based
compensation costs recognized under SFAS 123 for the year ended December31,
2005 and under SFAS 123Rfor year ended December31, 2007 and 2006

Restricted Stock Awards and
Performance Shares The Company determines
the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance shares based on the
market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Compensation
cost for such awards is recognized ratably over the vesting or service period,
net of forfeitures; however, compensation cost related to performance shares
will not be recorded or will be reversed if the Company does not believe it is
probable that such performance criteria will be met or if the service provider
employee or otherwise fails to meet such criteria. A summary of the Companys

As of December31,
2007, there was $96 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 18years. No performance shares
were outstanding as of December31, 2007. 61 Stock Options Incentive
and non-qualified stock options issued to directors, officers, employees and
consultants are issued at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
the stock at the date of grant. The Companys stock options generally vest over
a two to three year period and expire ten years from the date of grant.
Compensation cost related to stock options is recognized ratably over the
vesting or service period and is net of forfeitures. The fair
value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table presents the
weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for options
granted during the year ended December31, 2007. During the year ended December31,
2007, 2,141,700 options were granted by the Company under the 2007 Long-term
Incentive Plan. The expected life of the options represents the period of time
the options are expected to be outstanding.
For the year ended December31 2007, the expected term of options
granted was derived based on a weighting between athe Companys
historical exercise and forfeiture activity and bthe average midpoint
between vesting and the contractual term. For the year ended December31,
2006, the expected term of options granted was based on the contractual term.
In the future, as information regarding post-vesting termination becomes more
accessible, the Company may change the method of deriving the expected term.
This change could impact the fair value of options granted in the future. The
Company expects to refine the method of deriving the expected term for 2008.
For the year ended December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, our
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock for a
period approximating the expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on
the observed U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time the options were
granted. The dividend yield is based on our history of dividend payouts.

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options
outstanding at December31, 2007 was $204 million, of which
$105million relates to awards vested and exercisable and
$99million relates to awards expected to vest. The intrinsic value for
stock options outstanding is calculated as the amount by which the quoted price
of our common stock as of December31, 2007 exceeds the exercise price of
the option. Warrants As of December31, 2007, the Company had 250,000
warrants outstanding. For their role as
placement agent, in connection with the private placement of 11,466,000 shares
of common stock in July2005, Morgan Keegan Company,Inc.
received fully vested warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of the Companys
common stock at an exercise price of $300 per share. Such warrants expire on July19,
2010. These warrants were valued at $325,000 using the Black-Scholes model,
which amount was treated as additional non-cash stock offering costs. Additionally, for their financial advisory services,
in connection with the private placement of 4,482,000 shares of common stock in
June2006, Morgan Keegan Company,Inc. received fully
vested warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of the Companys common stock at an
exercise price of $300 per share. Such warrants expire on June30, 2011.
These warrants were valued at $248,645 using the Black-Scholes model, which
amount was treated as additional non-cash stock offering costs. All warrants issued were valued using the
Black-Scholes model, which amount was treated as additional non-cash stock
offering costs. The following table
presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for
options granted during the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006. The same methodologies applied to determine
the assumptions used to value the options noted above were also used in valuing
the warrants issued to Morgan Keegan Company. No warrants were
issued during the year ended December31, 2007.

Contingent Incentive Earn-Out Shares During 2005, the Companys Board of
Directors awarded a total of 485,000 shares of incentive stock awards to three
of the Companys officers. The incentive stock awards vest and the earn-out
shares are issuable once the Company is entitled to receive as its
proportionate share from gross production from any oil and gas wells owned or
operated by the Company not less than 2,000 barrels of oil per day or its
equivalent approximately 12 million cubic feet of gas per day prior 63 to December28, 2007,
the same target applicable to the Merger earn-out shares see immediately below.
However, one of the Companys officers entitled to receive earn-out shares
resigned from the Company and its subsidiaries effective June15, 2006,
and as a result 225,000 of the unvested contingent incentive stock awards,
representing $990,000 of future possible compensation expense, were forfeited.
Subsequently, 190,000 shares of those 225,000 shares were awarded to the
officers successor to supplement a previous award of 35,000 shares. The
second earn-out target provided for in the original merger agreement related to
its merger with Navidec,Inc. In November2007
the production target in the Merger Agreement dated July8, 2004 was
achieved. The determination was made by the Companys Board of Directors based
on certification by the independent engineering firm that the Companys
production in Peru has met or exceeded the required level of production. The
achievement of the required level of production resulted in the issuance of
450,000 shares. For accounting purposes,
during
the year ended December31, 2007, $1,980,000 was recorded as compensation
expense. Merger Earn-Out Shares Under the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the Company committed to issue 18,000,000 shares to the former
shareholders of BPZ-Texas on a contingent earn-out basis if the Company
achieved certain reserve and production goals. The first earn-out target
relating to reserves was achieved in December2004 and 9,000,000 of the
earn-out shares were issued. The remaining 9,000,000 earn-out shares were
contingent on the Company becoming entitled to receive as its proportionate
share from gross production from any oil and gas wells owned or operated by the
Company not less than 2,000 barrels of oil per day or its equivalent
approximately 12 million cubic feet of gas per day prior to December28,
2007. As mentioned above, in November2007
the production target was achieved based on certification by an independent
engineering firm that the Companys production in Peru has met or exceeded the
required level of production. For accounting purposes, the
earn-out arrangement is treated as a stock dividend because the earn-out is
payable to the shareholders of the accounting acquirer, BPZ-Texas. Accordingly,
except for a retroactive increase in the number of common shares outstanding
for all periods presented, no accounting entry is required upon the issuance of
the earn-out shares. Long-Term Incentive Compensation
Plan and Directors Compensation Incentive Plan On August17,
2007, the Company adopted the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan the 2007
LTIP, which is an amendment and restatement of the BPZ Energy,Inc. 2005
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan the 2005 LTIP. The amendment and
restatement was recommended by the Board of Directors and adopted pursuant to
the approval of the shareholders at the 2007 annual meeting of shareholders
held on August17, 2007. The 2007 LTIP supersedes and replaces the 2005
LTIP but will not impair the vesting or exercise of any award granted under the
2005 LTIP prior to the date the 2007 LTIP became effective. The provisions of
the 2005 LTIP applicable to directors are set forth in a separate 2007
Directors Compensation Incentive Plan the Directors Plan, which was also
adopted by the Company pursuant to the approval of the shareholders at the 2007
annual meeting of shareholders held August17, 2007. The
2007 LTIP increases the amount of securities available for incentive awards to
an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits
and other similar events. The 2007 LTIP terminates on the earlier of 1ten
years from the date the 2007 LTIP becomes effective, or 2at such time
as no shares of common stock of the Company remain available for issuance
through the plan. The Companys officers, employees and consultant and the
employees of certain of the Companys affiliates are eligible to participate in
the 2007 LTIP. The 2007 LTIP allows for the award of 1incentive stock
options under Section422 of the Tax Code, 2non-statutory stock
options not covered under Section422 of the Tax Code, 3stock
appreciation rights granting the recipient the right to receive an excess in
the fair market value as defined in the 2007 LTIP of shares of stock over a
specified reference price, 4restricted stock, which will be subject to
a risk of forfeiture and nontransferable until it vests over time, 5qualified
performance-based incentive to employees who qualify as covered employees
within the meaning of Section162mof the Tax Code, as amended, 6unrestricted
stock, which will be immediately transferable, and 7other stock-based
incentive awards. Any vesting provisions for an award made under the 2007 LTIP
may be determined by the Compensation Committee. Awards will generally vest in
four years unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee. The
Directors Plan supersedes and replaces the portions of the 2005 LTIP
applicable to non-employee directors, but will not impair the vesting or
exercise of any incentive granted to a director under the 2005 LTIP prior to
the date the Directors Plan became effective. The Directors Plan will
terminate on the earlier of 1ten years from the date that the Directors
Plan becomes effective, or 2at such time as no shares of common stock
of the Company remain available for issuance through the plan. The Companys
non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Directors Plan. The
Directors Plan provides for the issuance of up to 2,500,000 shares of the
Companys common stock to non-employee 64 directors,
subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events. The Directors
Plan allows for the award of 1non-statutory stock options not covered
under Section422 of the Tax Code, 2stock appreciation rights,
granting the recipient the right to receive an excess in the fair market value
as defined in the Directors Plan of shares of stock over a specified
reference price, 3restricted stock, which will be subject to a risk of
forfeiture and nontransferable until it vests over time, 4unrestricted
stock, which will be immediately transferable, and 5other stock-based
incentive awards. Vesting under the Directors Plan will be determined by the
Compensation Committee. Awards will generally vest in four years unless
otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee. Note
11 Affiliate and Related Party Transactions As of December31, 2007 and December31,
2006, the Company had not entered into any transactions with affiliates or related
parties. Note 12 Income

the year ended December31, 2007, income tax of approximately $39,001 of
taxes, penalties and interest were incurred related to our investment income in
Ecuador. See Note 6 Investment in
Ecuador Property and Note Payable to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further discussion regarding the Companys investment in its Ecuador property.

The Company recorded a

from the income tax benefit above, as it believes, based on the weight of
available evidence, that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset
will not be realized due to tax net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $355 million expiring in various amounts through 2027. 65 Note 13 Business Segment Information The Company determines
and discloses its segments in accordance with SFAS No131 Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information which uses a management
approach for determining segments. The
management approach designates the internal organization that is used by
management for making operating decisions and assessing parlance as the source
of the Companys reportable segments.
SFAS No131 also requires disclosures about products or services,
geographic areas, and major customers.
The Companys management reporting structure provided for only one
segment for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and
accordingly, no separate segment information is presented. In addition, the Company operates only in
Peru and has only one customer for its production. Segment
Information Operating
and geographic information: The Company
operates primarily in one segment which involves the production of oil. All of the Companys sales are made under a
short-term contract to the Peruvian national oil company, Petroperu. The majority of our long-lived assets are
located in Peru. Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies Transfer of NFS On September9,
2004, the day prior to the effective date of the Merger, Navidec assigned all
of its pre-merger business operations, assets and liabilities to NFS and all
issued and outstanding shares of NFS were subsequently transferred to the
Navidec pre-merger shareholders of record as of September9, 2004, for no
cash consideration. The transfer of NFS
shares was affected by NFS to the pre-merger Navidec shareholders of record as
of September9, 2004. Consistent with the terms of the Merger Agreement,
the Company had no control in the actions resulting in the transfer of the NFS
shares and the Company believed, based on information provided by NFS and its
advisors that NFS had undertaken the necessary actions to comply with
applicable registration requirements. However, because a registration of the
NFS shares was not effective at the time of the transfer of the NFS shares, and
has still not become effective, it might be determined that the transfer of the
NFS shares was made without full compliance with registration or qualification
requirements under applicable securities laws. As a result, although the
Company took no actions in connection with the transfer, because the Company is
a successor by merger to Navidec,Inc., if regulatory authorities
determine that the Company did not comply with applicable registration
requirements in connection with the transfers, fines or other sanctions could
be imposed on the Company with respect to the transaction. While federal and state
regulators might conclude that the Company was subject to responsibility for
registration of the shares, the Company regards the possibility of liability
arising from the distribution of the NFS shares as remote for the following
reasons: The Company took no action with
respect to the transfer of NFS shares which, pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, was agreed to be handled by NFS, including any necessary
qualifications or registrations under applicable securities laws. Further, the
Company believed, based on information provided by NFS and its advisors that
NFS had undertaken to comply with all applicable registration requirements.
Additionally, the transfer, which was tantamount to a stock dividend to the
pre-merger shareholders of Navidec,Inc., did not involve cash
consideration, making a finding of any damage to shareholders unlikely.
Finally, it is the Companys understanding that NFS is taking action to
register the NFS shares and is communicating with the SEC to address this issue
to the SECs satisfaction. Although the Company
regards the possibility of liability resulting from the transfer of NFS as
remote, the Company does recognize the risk of such liability, and therefore
cautions current and prospective Company shareholders of such risk. Peru Properties As of December31, 2007, in
connection with its Peru properties, the Company obtained five performance
bonds totaling $60 million to guarantee certain obligations and commitments,
of which four related to performance obligations under the license contracts
for Blocks Z-1, XIX, XXII and XXIII. As of December31, 2007, the Company
had restricted cash deposits of approximately $38 million which partially
collateralize the performance bonds. The Company was also required to deposit
approximately $08 million as restricted cash to collateralize a performance
bond of $10 million in connection with the beginning of the third exploration
period under the Block Z-1 license contract, which began in June2007. In
addition, it was required to deposit approximately $02 million as restricted
cash to collateralize performance bonds of $04 million under the Block XIX
license contract in connection with the first exploration period. The Company
was also required to post a $10 million performance bond to guarantee payment
under a service agreement, which is set to expire in January2008. In
connection with signing the license contracts for Blocks XXII and XXIII in November2007,
the Company was required to post $03 million and $15 million, respectively in
restricted cash to collateralize $06 million and $31 66 million, bonds respectively, in connection with the first
exploration period. The performance
bonds were issued by Peruvian banks and their terms are governed by the
corresponding license contract or agreement. In
connection with Block Z-1, in December, 2006, as a result of the drilling of
the first well, the CX11-21XD, the $13 million performance bond and related
cash posted as collateral was released. The third exploration period began in May2007
and is scheduled to expire in December2008. It will require the drilling
of an additional exploratory well or other equivalent work commitments. A performance bond of $10 million was also
posted for cash collateral of $750,000 as a result. The fourth and final
exploration period is scheduled to begin in December2008 and expire in December2009.
It will also require the drilling of an additional exploratory well or other
equivalent work commitments and will require a performance bond of $10
million. The performance bond amounts are not cumulative, and are released at
the end of each exploration period if the work commitment for that period has
been satisfied. In addition, we are required to make technology transfer
payments related to training costs of Perupetro professional staff during the
exploration phase of $50,000 per year.
On November21, 2007, the Company submitted a letter to Perupetro
declaring a commercial discovery in the Block Z-1 field. The Company is currently putting together a
field development plan which is required to be filed with Perupetro within 180
days of the declaration of the commercial discovery. The commercial development period of the
contract will commence as soon as the Company receives approval of the field
development plan. Under the contract, oil exploration, development and
production can continue for a total of up to 30 years from the effective date
of the contract, and gas exploration, development and production can continue
for up to 40 years. Royalties under the contract vary from 5% to 20% based on
production volumes. In
connection with the Block XIX license contract, the Company recently completed
shooting 200 kilometers of 2-D seismic. The cost to acquire this seismic data
was approximately $36 million. The Company has completed the processing and
interpreting the data. Based on the results of the 2-D seismic survey and in
order to comply with the requirements under the next phase of the license
contract, the Company plans to drill a well in Block XIX in late 2008 at an
estimated cost of $80 million. If a
commercial discovery is made during the exploration period, the contract will
allow for the exploration and production of oil for a period of 30 years from
the effective date of the contract and the exploration and production of gas
for a period of 40 years. Royalties under the contract vary from 15% to 30%
based on production volumes. Royalties
start at 5% if and when production is less than 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent
per day boepd and are capped at 20% if and when production surpasses 100,000
boepd. As part of the Block XXII License Contract which was
signed on November21, 2007, the Company was required to obtain a cash
collateralized $06 million performance bond in connection with the first
exploration period. The performance bond
was purchased for $03 million and was issued by
a Peruvian bank under terms governed by the license contract. The term of the
license contract extends over a seven year period divided into five periods or
four periods of 18 months and a final period of 12 months. Under certain circumstances, the exploration
periods may be extended for an additional period of up to three years. Under each exploration period, a performance
bond will be required. The performance bond amounts are not
cumulative, and will be released at the end of each exploration period if the
work commitment for that period has been satisfied. Additionally, the first period requires that we purchase, process and interpret 200 kms
of 2-D seismic data. The Company will
also be required to prepare a comprehensive geological and engineering study
for the area. In each subsequent period
after the first 18 month period we are required to drill an exploratory well. If a commercial discovery is made
during the exploration period, the contract will allow for the exploration and
production of oil for a period of 30 years from the effective date of the
contract and the exploration and production of gas for a period of 40 years.
Royalties under the contract vary from 15% to 30% based on production
volumes. Royalties start at 15% if and
when production is less than 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd
and are capped at 30% if and when production surpasses 100,000 boepd. In connection with the Block XXIII License Contract which
was signed, on November21, 2007, the Company was required to obtain a
cash collateralized $3 million performance bond in connection with the first
exploration period. The bond was
purchased for $15 million and was issued by
a Peruvian bank under terms governed by the license contract. The license contract extends over
a seven year period divided in to two periods of 18 months and two periods of
24 months. Under each exploration
period, a performance bond will be required.
The
performance bond amounts are not cumulative, and will be released at the end of
each exploration period if the work commitment for that period has been
satisfied. In addition, it commits the Company to drill a certain number of wells,
acquire certain amount of either 2-D or 3-D seismic data and prepare an
integrated geological, geochemical and reservoir engineering evaluation of the
hydrocarbon prospects in the block. If a commercial discovery is made
during the exploration period, the contract will allow for the exploration and
production of oil for a period of 30 years from the effective date of the
contract and the exploration and production of gas for a period of 40 years.
Royalties under the contract vary from 15% to 30% based on production volumes. Royalties start at 15% if and when production
is less than 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd and are capped at
30% if and when production 67 surpasses 100,000 boepd. An obligation was recorded for the
plug and abandonment of the producing oil wells, the 21XD and the 14D, in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations ARO related to the plug and abandonment of our wells. However, the Company also acquired four offshore
platforms in connection with its Block Z-1 property. The Company completed the
refurbishment of one of the offshore platforms and intends to maintain all of
the platforms for use throughout the life of the Block Z-1 contract. These
platforms revert back to the Government of Peru at the end of the contract,
provided they are in good working condition, with no further obligation to the
company to dismantle or remove them. The Company and its legal advisors have
reviewed Peruvian law and existing regulations from the Peruvian Ministry of
Energy and Mines in conjunction with the requirements of SFAS No143 as
it applies to tangible long lived assets and their future retirement and
dismantlement. The Company has concluded there is no legal obligation to dismantle
the platforms, as defined in SFAS No143, and therefore recognition of an
ARO is not required. Accordingly, no such provision for dismantling the
platforms is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
If, however, current laws or regulations were changed or the platforms were no
longer in good working order, the Company could be obligated to dismantle and
remove them. The current estimated cost to dismantle an offshore platform is
estimated to be approximately $20 million, depending upon the condition of the
platform and the depth of the water. In December2005, the Company
signed a drilling contract with Petrex S.A., a subsidiary of Saipem SpA of
Italy. Under the contract, Petrex S.A. will provide a platform rig capable of drilling
to 16,000 feet and upgrade the rig to meet the Companys specifications. The
Company is utilizing the rig for the initial development of the Corvina field
and may also utilize it for the expected development of the Albacora oil field,
and potential appraisal wells in the Piedra Redonda gas field. The Company paid
a $55 million fee to mobilize and upgrade the rig. In exchange, the Company
received a discounted fixed day rate and exclusive rights to use the rig, at
its option, during the two-year period which commenced in September2006.
In addition, after the guaranteed two-year period, the Company has the option
to extend the contract for an additional year at market rates. Barge Incident In
early August2006, the Company incurred an operational delay of
approximately three weeks resulting from a navigation incident which caused the
BPZ-01 barge to be grounded on a sand bank in Talara Bay in northwest Peru
during the second mobilization trip to the Corvina CX-11 platform. No injuries
were sustained by any of our employees, nor to any of the tug boat operators
crew members. The BPZ-01 is a U.S. flagged vessel and as such was inspected
after the incident by the U.S. Coast Guard, to its satisfaction. The barge
resumed normal operations immediately thereafter. Based upon information
currently available, the Company estimates that total expenditures related to
this incident will be approximately $11million. As of December31,
2006, approximately $382,000 had been incurred for barge recovery and temporary
repairs to the vessel. In addition, the Company expects to incur approximately
$330,000 in permanent repairs to the barge and approximately $432,000 of
consequential damages, primarily stand-by charges. As of the March14,
2008, the Company has not presented a final claim to our insurance carrier for
the barge repairs and we are negotiating a settlement agreement with a third
party for recovery of any damages not covered through our insurance. A
mandatory dry-dock is scheduled for the second quarter 2008 at which time a
full survey of the barge will be conducted and an insurance claim is expected
to be filed. The Company believes the
majority of the costs associated with this incident will be reimbursed through
insurance or through a third party. No assurances can be given, however, that
any such recoveries will be sufficient to cover all costs associated with this
incident or to the timing of any such recoveries. This incident did not have a
material impact on our operations or business plan. Charter of Navy Tankers On October24,
2007, the Companys primary marine transportation contractor entered into two
short term agreements with the commercial division of the Peruvian Navy to
lease two tankers to transport oil to market earlier than scheduled. The two
tankers leased from the Navy each have capacity of approximately 7,000 barrels. On January30,
2008, one of the Navy tankers, the Supe, caught fire and sank into the ocean
close to the CX11 platform. Although no
BPZ employees or subcontractors directly managed by the Company were injured,
there were injuries sustained by the Peruvian sailors including two
fatalities. At the time of the incident
the Supe tanker contained approximately 1,300 barrels of oil, most of which was
burned in the fire. The Company believes that environmental issues have
been adequately controlled and is continuing to monitor the situation. The Companys platform, barges, drilling and
well testing equipment, and other facilities were not damaged. Production from the 21XD and 14D wells,
approximately 4,200 barrels of oil per day at the time, as well as the testing
operations on the 18XD has been temporarily suspended 68 pending a complete
investigation. Currently all production
which had reached approximately 4,200 barrels of oil per day by late January
2008 is shut-in due to the incident involving the Navy tanker. At the
request of the OSINERGMIN, the government agency responsible for auditing the
safety of energy investments in Peru, we successfully performed a series of
safety and integrity tests on the facilities at the CX-11 Corvina platform,
including the equipment that was being used for the ongoing long-term testing
of the 21XD and 14D wells. We confirmed that the well testing equipment
was in operational condition. On March 12, 2008 we received clearance
from the OSINERGMIN, to resume operations at the CX-11 platform, including the
scheduled 18XD well drill stem test. However, the four Corvina wells are
currently shut-in while we complete the installation of sea-bed pipelines
connecting the platform to the transport barge, along with the required mooring
systems, that will allow for an improved long-term testing program.
Additionally, we are waiting for final clarification from the appropriate
authorities in Peru regarding the transportation of our crude oil to the
refinery. The Company has submitted
all the requested reports and documentation generated during the
investigation. A number of organizations
involved in the investigation have issued reports concluding there was no
environmental damage due to the incident.
Additionally, the Company assisted the Peruvian Navy in conducting an
underwater survey of the Supe, which established that the vessel does not represent
a hazard to navigation nor a marine pollution threat, as all its tanks were
found to be empty. The CX-11 Corvina
platform and all its facilities, as well as the BPZ-01 tender barge, the four
Corvina wells, and all the vessels supporting the operations have now been
certified to be in operational condition. The
ongoing investigation has not resulted in any sanctions against the Company for
any wrong doing or for any inadequate safety and/or environmental procedures as
a result of the fire. Nonetheless, the
Company continues to try and improve safety as a result of the vessel incident
and will continue to cooperate with officials who are investigating the
incident. Other than the temporary
suspension of operations, the incident is not expected
to have a material impact on the Companys future operations or business plan. As noted above, the
Company currently has two additional barges under a capital lease agreement. On
June13, 2007, the Company entered into a capital lease agreement, with an option to purchase, for two
barges to assist in the development of the Corvina oil. The two barges were
towed to Peru where one barge, the Nu uanu, is currently being used to
transport oil between the CX11 platform and the refinery in Talara,
approximately 100 miles south. The
Nomoku is currently being out-fitted with the required equipment for its
intended use as a floating production, storage and offloading facility FPSO
that will be moored next to the CX11 platform.
However, we have encountered some delays due to scheduling. We expect the FPSO to be fully out-fitted and
operational by the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter
2008. The Company will continue to make commitments in the
ordinary course of business as it pursues its development plans for the
properties. Financing Activities On October22, 2007, the
Company entered into a non-binding term sheet agreement with the International
Finance Corporation IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank Group
based in Washington, D.C., delineating the key terms and conditions for the
first tranche see Loan C immediately below of a debt package with IFC. Previously, the Company announced a total
debt package, approved by IFC, of $1005 million approved by the IFC but subject
to final due diligence and documentation. The Company is actively negotiating
with IFC to increase the debt package to an estimated $165 million for further
development of our assets. The
initial $120 million financing package was approved by the Credit Committee of
the IFC on November29, 2006, which included an investment by IFC in BPZs
common stock and took place on December18, 2006. The
common stock was priced at $300 per share resulting in proceeds to us of
approximately $195 million. The offering was placed directly by the Company
and there were no placement fees. IFC currently holds approximately a 9% equity position
in the Company with 65 million shares of our common stock. In addition, IFC has a preemptive right to
purchase its pro rata share of common stock or securities convertible into
common stock that are issued and sold by the Company except for certain
issuances of securities, such as pursuant to stock splits, stock dividends,
acquisitions by the Company or under the Companys incentive compensation
plan. IFCs total equity and senior debt investment in the Company, subject to
execution and funding of the increased debt agreement, as described above, will
reach approximately $185 million. Any increased debt package will be subject to
final internal approvals by appropriate representatives of both IFC and
BPZ. It is uncertain if such approval
will occur, or if approved, the timing or amount of such approvals. The
proposed $165 million facility is anticipated to consist of the following Loan C, which is comprised of $155
million of convertible debt, closed in early November2007. The 69 conversion
price is $1039 per share and includes a forced conversion price of $1819 per
share, based on an average closing price over twenty consecutive business days.
The instrument has a 10 year term with a variable interest rate of 2% per annum
above 6-month LIBOR. The loan from the
IFC is unsecured, but restricts our ability to pledge assets to another lender
unless certain conditions are met. The IFC loan does not restrict our
ability to issue additional capital stock, but does call for an adjustment in
its conversion price into BPZ common stock based on the terms of any subsequent
equity offering. The agreement contains customary default and
cross-default provisions along with covenants restricting our ability to pay
dividends and the disposition of assets. We are required to maintain a
required ratio of Balance Sheet Liabilities to Tangible Net Worth as defined
in the Loan Agreement, calculated quarterly, of no greater than 70:30.
As of December31, 2007, we were in compliance with all financial
covenants. Loan A, which is for IFCs own account,
is expected to consist of $345 million in long-term senior debt. This second
tranche is expected to be closed during the second quarter of 2008. The terms of the instrument are still being
negotiated. Loan B, comprised of senior debt to be
syndicated by IFC, is projected to be approximately $115 million. This third
tranche is expected to close in the third quarter 2008. This remaining debt
portion of the financing will be subject to identification of the lending
syndicate members and subsequent negotiation and approval of the necessary loan
documentation. As of March14, 2008, the
final loan documents for the A and B Loans have not been completed. In conjunction
with the gas-to-power project, the recent discovery of oil reserves in the
Corvina field has prompted the Company to simultaneously direct its attention
towards accelerating the development of potential oil production in the Corvina
field. On June13, 2007 the Company entered into a capital lease
agreement, with an option to purchase, for two barges to assist in the
development of the Corvina oil. The capital lease for the two barges began in August2007
and expires in November2009. Lease payments are variable, based on the
working status of the barges with a purchase option of $5,000,000 after the
first year of the lease and $4,000,000 after the maturity date of the lease.
The capital lease obligation was recorded at the present value of the minimum
lease payments at an imputed discount rate of 18%, which reflects the Companys
incremental borrowing rate for this transaction. The assets will be depreciated
over the term of the capital lease obligation. The capital lease assets were
recorded at $6,180,679, which represents the present value of the minimum lease
payments, or the aggregate fair market value of the assets. Note
15 Legal Proceedings SEC
Inquiry of Navidec Navidec was advised in February2004
that the SEC was conducting an informal inquiry to determine whether Navidec
had violated federal securities laws. Based on the information made available
to the Company, it believes the SECs investigation relates, at least in part,
to the restatement of Navidecs reported earnings for the first and second
quarters of 2003. This restatement was reported in Navidecs Form10-Q for
the third quarter of 2003 filed on December11, 2003. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company
has been indemnified by NFS for the costs of the SEC investigation, and NFS has
borne the costs incurred to date. The Company is not aware of the future
actions, if any, which the SEC intends to pursue in this matter, but no
assurance can be given that the investigation has been and will be resolved
without negative consequences to the Company. Transfer
of Ownership in NFS On July8,
2004, Navidec and BPZ-Texas entered into a Merger Agreement which was
consummated on September10, 2004. The Merger Agreement provided that all
of the pre-merger business operations, assets and liabilities of Navidec would
be transferred to a wholly-owned subsidiary, Navidec Financial Services,Inc.
NFS, followed by the transfer of NFS to the pre-merger shareholders of
record as of September9, 2004, the day prior to the consummation of the
Merger. See BusinessNavidec Merger Transaction,
Risk FactorsRisk Relating to the OfferingThe
transfer of NFS could result in liability to us because the shares transferred
were not registered with the SEC, and Note2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this filing, for detailed
discussion regarding the Merger. Based
upon this provision of the Merger Agreement, the Company believed that it had
no continuing ownership of NFS and, therefore, did not account for the
post-merger operations of NFS in the presentation of its financial statements.
After receipt of comments from the SEC in connection with its review of the
Companys registration statement filed on July27, 2005 and further review 70 of this issue, the
Company concluded it was the record, but not beneficial, owner of NFS shares,
and that any ownership interest was at most temporary. The
Company commenced an action against NFS the Action on or about February13,
2006, in District Court, Arapahoe County, Colorado the Court, seeking a
judicial resolution of this matter. The Action was settled amongst the parties
on May19, 2006. In connection with the settlement, a Finding of Fact and
Conclusions of Law the Order was issued by the Court stating that the
Company was not a shareholder of NFS at any time after September9, 2004. Note
16 Minimum Lease Payments The
Company leases office space in Houston, Texas under a five-year operating
lease. We also have offices in Lima,
Peru and Quito, Ecuador, both of which are under a month-to-month operating
lease. Total rent expense incurred for the years ended December31, 2007,
2006 and 2005 was approximately $$324,000, $252,000 and $98,000,
respectively. Minimum non-cancelable

17 Subsequent Events In January2008,
250,000 common stock warrants with a strike price of $300 per share where
exercised by Morgan Keegan Company,Inc. These warrants had
been issued to Morgan Keegan Company,Inc. in connection with
its role as financial advisor to the Company, in connection with the private
placements of 11,466,000 and 4,482,000 shares of common stock in Julyof
2005 and Juneof 2006, respectively.
Net proceeds to the Company as a result of the exercise of these
warrants were approximately $750,000.
For more detail, see Note 10 Stockholders Equity
to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Warrants above. In February2008, we entered
into a lease-purchase agreement to acquire a deck barge BPZ 02, of
approximately 330 feet in length, to assist in the drilling activities in the
Albacora field as well as to assist in future drilling and development
activities. In the near term, the BPZ 02
will be used to act as a tender assist for the Petrex drilling rig as it is
moved to the Albacora field in third quarter 2008. During that time, as mentioned in Note 14 Commitment
and Contingencies, the BPZ 01 will be placed in drydock to repair damages
sustained when it ran aground in late 2006.
The acquisition of the BPZ 02 allows the Company better asset
maintenance scheduling and will aid in the support of increased offshore
exploration and development activities.
The terms of the lease-purchase stipulate a 19% rate of interest over a
one year term at which point, title to the BPZ 02 will transfer to the Company
upon final payment of the lease. The
Company will account for the transaction as a Capital Lease in accordance to
SFAS 13, Accounting For Leases As Amended under the criteria the barge will
transfer title at the end of the lease period and, as a result, depreciation
will be calculated over the economic life of the asset. Note
18 Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures Unaudited Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities The
following disclosures for the Company are made in accordance with SFAS No69,
Disclosures About Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities an amendment of
FASB Statements 19, 25, 33 and 39. Users of this information should be aware
that the process of estimating quantities of proved, proved developed and
proved undeveloped crude oil and natural gas reserves is very complex,
requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available
geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a
given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous
factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity,
evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of
production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions
to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every
reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates 71 reported represent the
most accurate assessments possible, the significance of the subjective
decisions required and variances in available data for various reservoirs make
these estimates generally less precise than other estimates presented in
connection with financial statement disclosures. Proved
reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil that
geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating
conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. Proved
developed reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered, through wells
and equipment in place and under operating methods being utilized at the time
the estimates were made. Proved
undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new
wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major
expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are
limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably
certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units
can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is
continuity of production from the existing productive formation. Estimates for
proved undeveloped reserves are not attributed to any acreage for which an
application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is
contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests
in the area and in the same reservoir. Our
relevant management controls over proved reserve attribution, estimation and
evaluation include controls over and processes for the collection and
processing of all pertinent operating data and documents needed by our
independent reservoir engineers to estimate our proved reserves engagement of well qualified and independent reservoir
engineers for review of our operating data and documents and preparation of
reserve reports annually in accordance with all SEC reserve estimation
guidelines; and review by our senior reservoir engineer and his staff
of the independent reservoir engineers reserves reports for completion and
accuracy. Market
prices as of each year-end will be used for future sales of natural gas, crude
oil and natural gas liquids. Future operating costs, production taxes and
capital costs will be based on current costs as of each year-end, with no
escalation. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities
of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production and timing
of development expenditures. Reserve data represent estimates only and should
not be construed as being exact. Moreover, the standardized measure should not
be construed as the current market value of the proved oil and natural gas
reserves or the costs that would be incurred to obtain equivalent reserves. A
market value determination would include many additional factors including aanticipated
future changes in natural gas and crude oil prices, production and development
costs, ban allowance for return on investment, cthe value of
additional reserves, not considered proved at present, which may be recovered
as a result of further exploration and development activities, and dother
business risk. Capitalized Costs Relating to Oil and Gas Producing

We
do not currently have the financial capacity or commitments for a development
program of this magnitude for our gas reserves. Accordingly, the Company has
not disclosed amounts of proved gas reserves in its SEC filings. At such time
as we obtain sufficient financial commitments to proceed with the full
development of the gas to power project and all other conditions necessary to
record proved reserves are met, we expect to record SEC proved gas reserves
as permitted under SEC rulesand disclose such reserves in future SEC
filings.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash
Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves The following information has been developed
utilizing procedures prescribed by SFAS No69 and based on natural gas
and crude oil reserve and production volumes estimated by the independent
petroleum reservoir engineers. This information may be useful for certain
comparison purposes but should not be solely relied upon in evaluating the
Company or its performance. Further, information contained in the following
table should not be considered as representative of realistic assessments of
future cash flows, nor should the standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows be viewed as representative of the current value of the Companys
oil and natural gas assets. The future cash flows presented below are based on
sales prices, cost rates and statutory income tax rates in existence as of the
date of the projections. It is expected that material revisions to some
estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves may occur in the future, development
and production of the reserves may occur in periods other than those assumed,
and actual prices realized and costs incurred may vary significantly from those
used. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and
giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under current laws, and
which relate to oil and natural gas producing activities. Management does not rely upon the following
information in making investment and operating decisions. Such decisions are
based upon a wide range of factors, including estimates of probable as well as
proved reserves and varying price and cost assumptions considered more
representative of a range of possible economic conditions that may be
anticipated. The following table sets forth the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows from projected production of the
Companys natural gas and crude oil reserves for the years ended December31,
2007, 2006 and 2005 76

Item 5. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES a Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures We performed an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on that
evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded that as of December31, 2007 our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose
in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rulesand forms. b Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting There was no change in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31,
2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. c Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the
Company, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15fof
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal controls are
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the 78 reliability of our
financial reporting and the preparation and presentation of the consolidated
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, as well as to safeguard
assets from unauthorized use or disposition. Management conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of
the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of
controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion
on this evaluation. We did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal
controls as a result of this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management
has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were
effective as of December31, 2007. Johnson Miller
Co., CPAs PC, the independent registered public accounting firm who also
audited our Consolidated Financial Statements, has issued an attestation report
on managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007, which is set forth below
under Attestation Report. d Attestation Report Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders 
BPZ Resources,Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited BPZ
Resources,Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the
COSO criteria. BPZ Resources,Inc.s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Item9A, Managements Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, BPZ
Resources,Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the
COSO criteria. We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, the consolidated balance sheets of BPZ Resources,Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related 79 consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders equity deficit, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2007 and our report dated March12,
2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Johnson Miller
