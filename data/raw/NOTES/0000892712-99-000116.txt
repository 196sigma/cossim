Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors
of School Specialty, Inc.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the index appearing under Item
14a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of School Specialty, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at April 24, 1999 and April 25, 1998, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended April
24, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 14a2 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and
the financial statement schedule are the responsibility
of the Company management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and
the financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts
NOTE 1-BACKGROUND
School Specialty, Inc. the Company is a
Delaware  corporation  which  was  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary of U.S. Office Products Company U.S.
Office Products until June 9, 1998. On June 9, 1998,
U.S. Office Products spun-off its Educational Supplies
and Products Division the Education Division as an
independent publicly owned company. This transaction
was effected through the distribution of shares of the
Company to U.S. Office Products' shareholders the
Distribution. Prior to the Distribution, U.S. Office
Products contributed its equity interests in certain
wholly-owned subsidiaries associated with the Education
Division to the Company. U.S. Office Products and the
Company  entered into a number of agreements  to
facilitate the Distribution and the transition of the
Company  to  an  independent business  enterprise.
Additionally, concurrently with the Distribution, the
Company sold 2,125 shares in an initial public offering
the IPO. Following the IPO, management purchased
250 shares.
The Education Division was created by U.S. Office
Products in May 1996 in connection with the acquisition
of School Specialty, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation
Old School. This business combination and the
acquisition  in July 1996 of The Re-Print  Corp.
Re-Print  were  accounted  for  under  the
pooling-of-interests method Old School and Re-Print
are herein referred to as the Pooled Companies. As a
result of these business combinations being accounted
for under the pooling-of-interests method, the results
of the Company prior to the completion of such business
combinations represent the combined results of the
Pooled  Companies operating as separate autonomous
entities. NOTE 2-BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
and related notes to consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of School Specialty, Inc. and the
companies acquired in business combinations accounted
for under the purchase method from their respective
dates of acquisition and give retroactive effect to the
results  of the Pooled Companies for all periods
presented.  For the periods prior to the Distribution,
the  consolidated financial statements reflect the
assets, liabilities, divisional equity, revenues and
expenses that were directly related to the Company as
it was operated within U.S. Office Products. In cases
involving  assets and liabilities not specifically
identifiable to any particular business of U.S. Office
Products, only those assets and liabilities that were
transferred to the Company were included in  the
Company separate consolidated balance sheet. The
Company consolidated statement of income includes all
of the related costs of doing business, including an
allocation of certain general corporate expenses of
U.S. Office Products which were not directly related to
these  businesses  including  certain  corporate
executives'  salaries, accounting and legal  fees,
departmental costs for accounting, finance, legal,
purchasing, marketing, human resources as well as other
general overhead costs. These allocations were based on
a variety of factors, dependent upon the nature of the
costs being allocated, including revenues, number and
size  of  acquisitions and number  of  employees.
Management believes these allocations were made on a
reasonable basis.
The consolidated statement of income does not
include an allocation of interest expense on all debt
allocated to the Company. See Note 9 for further
discussion of interest expense. NOTE 3-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements  in
conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Definition of Fiscal Year
As used in these consolidated financial statements
and related notes to consolidated financial statements,
fiscal 1999, fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997 refer to
the Company fiscal years ended April 24, 1999, April
25, 1998 and April 26, 1997, respectively.           SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In Thousnads, Except Per Share Amounts Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts  of  the  Company and  its  wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions
and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers temporary cash investments
with original maturities of three months or less from
the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of trade accounts receivable.  Receivables
arising from sales to customers are not collateralized
and, as a result, management continually monitors the
financial condition of its customers to reduce the risk
of loss.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out
FIFO basis and consist primarily of products held for
sale.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at  cost.
Additions and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of
property  and equipment is calculated  using  the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the respective assets. The estimated useful lives range
from 25 to 40 years for buildings and its components
and  3 to 15 years for furniture, fixtures  and
equipment. Property and equipment leased under capital
leases is being amortized over the lesser of its useful
life or its lease terms.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill,
which represents the excess of cost over the fair value
of  net  assets acquired in business combinations
accounted for under the purchase method and non-compete
agreements. Substantially all goodwill is amortized on
a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of
40 years, except for goodwill associated with  a
software subsidiary which is being amortized over 15
years.  Identifiable  intangible  assets  include

their estimated useful lives ranging from one to

Management  periodically  evaluates  the
recoverability of goodwill, which would be adjusted for
a permanent decline in value, if any, by comparing
anticipated  undiscounted future cash  flows  from
operations to net book value. If the operation is
determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount
if its assets, then intangible assets are written down
first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the
operation, to fair value. Fair value is determined
based on discounted cash flows or appraised values,
depending upon the nature of the assets.  Based upon
its most recent assessment, the Company does not
believe an impairment of long-lived assets exists at
April 24, 1999.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company financial
instruments  including cash and cash  equivalents,
accounts receivable accounts payable, and long-term
debt approximate fair value.
Income Taxes
Income taxes, during the period subsequent to the
Distribution, have been computed utilizing the asset
and liability approach which requires the recognition
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax
consequences of temporary differences           SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.

As a division of U.S. Office Products, the Company
did not file separate federal income tax returns but
rather was included in the federal income tax returns
filed by U.S. Office Products and its subsidiaries from
the respective dates that the entities within the
Company were acquired by U.S. Office Products. For
purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the
Company allocated share of U.S. Office Products'
income tax provision was based on the separate return
method.   Certain   companies   acquired   in
pooling-of-interests transactions elected to be taxed
as Subchapter S corporations, and accordingly, no
federal income taxes were recorded by those companies
for periods prior to their acquisition by U.S. Office
Products.

Litigation
Under the terms of the agreement entered into
between the Company and U.S. Office Products  in
connection with a strategic restructuring plan, the
Company is obligated, subject to a maximum obligation
of $175 million, to indemnify U.S. Office Products for
certain liabilities incurred by U.S. Office Products
prior to the Distribution, including liabilities under
federal  securities  laws  the  Indemnification
Obligation.  This Indemnification Obligation  is
reduced by any insurance proceeds actually recovered in
respect of the Indemnification Obligation and is shared
on a pro rata basis with the other three divisions of
U.S. Office Products which were spun-off from U.S.
Office Products in connection with the U.S. Office
Products comprehensive restructuring.
U.S. Office Products has been named a defendant in
various  class  action lawsuits.  These  lawsuits
generally allege violations of federal securities laws
by U.S. Office Products and other named defendants
during the months preceding the Strategic Restructuring
Plan. The Company has not received any notice or claim
from U.S. Office Products alleging that these lawsuits
are within the scope of the Indemnification Obligation,
but he Company believes that certain liabilities and
costs associated with these lawsuits up to a maximum
of $175 million are likely to be subject to the
Company Indemnification Obligation.  Nevertheless,
the Company does not presently anticipate that the
Indemnification Obligation will have a material adverse
effect on the Company. Thus, due to the preliminary
nature of this action, it is not possible at this time
to assess the outcome of the claims. In accordance
with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, no
provision  has been recorded in the  accompanying
financial statements.
The Company is, from time to time, a party to
litigation arising in the normal course  of  its
business.  Management believes that none of  this
litigation will have a material adverse effect on the
financial position, results of operations or cash flows
of the Company.
Postemployment Benefits
The Company has entered into employment agreements
with several employees that would result in payments to
these employees upon a change of control or certain
other events. No amounts have been accrued at April 24,
1999 or April 25, 1998 related to these agreements, as
no change of control has occurred.           SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.

Distribution
At the date of the Distribution, School Specialty,
U.S. Office Products and the other spin-off companies
entered into a distribution agreement, tax allocation
agreement, and an employee benefits agreement and the
spin-off companies entered into a tax indemnification
agreement  and  may enter into other  agreements,
including agreements relating to referral of customers
to one another. These agreements provide, among other
things, for U.S. Office Products and School Specialty
to indemnify each other from tax and other liabilities
relating to their respective businesses prior to and
following the Distribution. Certain of the obligations
of School Specialty and the other spin-off companies to
indemnify U.S. Office Products are joint and several.
Therefore, if one of the other spin-off companies fails
to satisfy its indemnification obligations to U.S.
Office  Products when such a loss occurs, School
Specialty may be required to reimburse U.S. Office
Products for all or a portion of the losses that
otherwise would have been allocated to other spin-off
companies.  In  addition, the agreements  allocate
liabilities, including general corporate and securities
liabilities of U.S. Office Products not specifically
related to the school supplies business, between U.S.
Office Products and the Company and the other spin-off
companies. The terms of the agreements that will govern
the relationship between School Specialty and U.S.
Office  Products were established by U.S.  Office
Products  in  consultation with School Specialty
management prior to the Distribution while School
Specialty was a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Office
Products. NOTE 13-EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
On June 9, 1998, the Company implemented the
School Specialty, Inc. 401k Plan the Company 401k
Plan  which  allows  employee  contributions  in
accordance with Section 401k of the Internal Revenue
Code.  The Company matches a portion of employee
contributions and all full-time employees are eligible
to participate in the Company 401k Plan after 90 days
of service.  In fiscal 1999 the Company matching
contribution expense was $416. Prior to June 9, 1998
the Company participated in the U.S. Office Products
401k Retirement Plan the 401k Plan, which was
similar to the plan adopted by the Company.
Certain subsidiaries of the Company have, or had
prior to implementation of the Company 401k Plan,
qualified defined contribution benefit plans, which
allow for voluntary pre-tax contributions by  the
employees. The subsidiaries paid all general  and
administrative expenses of the plans and in some cases
made matching contributions on behalf of the employees.           SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.

NOTE 14-STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Earnings Per Share
In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128,
Earnings  Per Share.  SFAS No. 128  establishes
standards for computing and presenting earnings per
share  EPS.  SFAS No. 128 requires the  dual
presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of
the  consolidated statement of income.  Basic EPS
excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the  weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the
period.  Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock. The Company adopted SFAS No. 128 during
fiscal 1998 and has restated all prior period EPS data.
The  following information presents the  Company
computations of basic and diluted EPS for the periods
presented in the consolidated statement of income.                      Income    Shares    Per Share
Numerator Denominator  Amount
Fiscal 1999:
Basic EPS                $ 8,896    14,690    $ 061

Diluted EPS               $ 8,132    10,196    $ 080
The Company had additional employee stock options
outstanding during the periods presented that were not
included in the computation of diluted EPS because they
were anti-dilutive.
Capital Contribution by U.S. Office Products
During fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998, U.S. Office
Products contributed $7,217 and $81,332, respectively,
of capital to the Company. The contribution reflects
the forgiveness of intercompany debt by U.S. Office
Products, as it was agreed that the Company would be
allocated only $80,000 of debt plus the amount of any
additional debt incurred after January 12, 1998 in
connection with the acquisition of entities that became
subsidiaries of the Company. The total debt allocated
to the Company at the time of the Distribution was
$83,300.
Stock Offerings
On June 15, 1998 the Company issued 2,125 shares
in conjunction with its IPO. In an offering concurrent
with the IPO, management acquired 250 shares. The
total net proceeds to the Company from the offerings
was $32,736.
On April 16, 1999 the Company issued 2,400 shares
in conjunction with a secondary public offering
receiving net proceeds of $40,820. On May 17, 1999 the
underwriters of the Company secondary offering
exercised their over allotment option for 151 shares of
Company stock at $1725 per share for net proceeds of
$2,412.
Employee Stock Plans
On June 10, 1998 the Board of Directors approved
the School Specialty, Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan
the Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to provide
officers, key employees and consultants with additional
incentives by increasing their           SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ownership interests in
the Company. The maximum number of options to purchase
common stock granted in any fiscal year under the Plan,
is equal to 20% of the Company outstanding common
stock. Prior to the approval of the Plan, the Company
had stock options outstanding under the U.S. Office
Products 1994 Long-Term Compensation Plan. The Company
replaced the options to purchase shares of common stock
of U.S. Office Products held by employees with options
issued under the Plan to purchase shares of common
stock of the Company. In order to keep the option
holders in the same economic position immediately
before and after the Distribution, the number of U.S.
Office Products options held by Company personnel was
multiplied by 0903 and the exercise price of those
options was divided by 0903 for purposes of the
replacement options. The vesting provisions and option
period of the original grants were not changed. All
option data reflected below has been retroactively
restated to reflect the effects of the Distribution.  The  Company  accounts for  options  issued  in
accordance  with APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly,
because the exercise prices of the options have equaled
the market price on the date of grant, no compensation
expense has been recognized for the options granted.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock options
been recognized based upon the fair value of the stock
options  on the grant date under the methodology
prescribed by SFAS 123, the Company net income and
net income per share would have been impacted as
indicated in the following table.                        For the Fiscal Year Ended
