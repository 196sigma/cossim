1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Metals USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Metals USA was founded on
July 3, 1996 to become a leading national value-added metals processor service
center, to manufacture higher-value components from processed metals and to
pursue aggressively the consolidation of the highly fragmented metals processing
industry. Prior to its initial public offering IPO, Metals USA had
conducted no operations. Concurrent with the consummation of its IPO on July 11,
1997, Metals USA acquired, in separate transactions the Mergers eight
companies the Founding Companies engaged in the processing of steel,
aluminum and specialty metals, as well as the manufacture of metal components.
Following the IPO and through December 31, 1997, Metals USA acquired seven
additional companies and subsequent to December 31, 1997, acquired eight
additional companies in similar businesses See Note 2. Certain of the
companies acquired after the IPO were accounted for using the
pooling-of-interests method, resulting in a restatement of the Company
financial statements for all periods presented See Note 2. References herein
to the Company include Metals USA and its subsidiaries.
The Company sells to businesses such as the machining, furniture,
transportation equipment, power and process equipment, industrial/commercial
construction, consumer durables and electrical equipment industries, and
machinery and equipment manufacturers. The Company believes that its broad
customer base and its wide array of metals processing capabilities, products and
services, coupled with its broad geographic coverage of the United States,
reduce the Company susceptibility to economic fluctuations affecting any one
industry or geographical area.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, ii
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the
date the financial statements are published and iii the reported amount of
revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. The Company
reviews all significant estimates affecting its consolidated financial
statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary
adjustments prior to their publication. Adjustments made with respect to the use
of estimates often relate to improved information not previously available.
Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the
preparation of financial statements.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Metals USA and its subsidiaries. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
statements. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' financial
statements to be consistent with the current year presentation.
INVENTORIES -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Certain of the Company subsidiaries use the last-in first-out LIFO
method of accounting for inventories and other subsidiaries use a variety of
methods including specific identification, average cost and the first-in
first-out FIFO method of accounting. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996,
approximately 464% and 522%, respectively of the consolidated inventories were
accounted for using the LIFO method of accounting.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT -- Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line
method at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the various classes of
assets.
GOODWILL -- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair
value of identifiable assets of the businesses acquired using the purchase
method of accounting. Goodwill is stated at cost, net of accumulated
amortization, and is being amortized over a forty-year life using the
straight-line method. The
33
METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
Company reviews the recoverability of goodwill and other long-lived assets
including other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired.
The Company has not recorded any impairment losses with respect to goodwill,
other long-lived assets or other intangible assets as of December 31, 1997.
Accumulated amortization totaled $12 as of December 31, 1997.
OTHER ASSETS -- Other assets include deferred financing costs and other
intangible assets, which are being amortized over the estimated useful life of
the related borrowing or intangible asset. Accumulated amortization of other
assets totaled $11 and $5 as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- The fair value of the notes payable
is estimated based on interest rates for the same or similar debt offered to the
Company having the same or similar remaining maturities and collateral
requirements. The carrying amounts of notes payable approximate fair value at
the applicable balance sheet dates.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK -- Financial instruments, which potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of
cash deposits, trade accounts and notes receivable. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to trade accounts are within the machining, furniture,
transportation equipment, power and process equipment, industrial/commercial
construction, consumer durables and electrical equipment industries, and
machinery and equipment manufacturers. Generally, credit is extended once
appropriate credit history and references have been obtained. Adjustments to the
allowance for doubtful accounts are made periodically as circumstances warrant
based upon the expected collectibility of all such accounts. The Company
periodically reviews the credit history of its customers and generally does not
require collateral for the extension of credit.
INCOME TAXES -- The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred income taxes are
recognized for the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted
tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are
established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized. Provision for income taxes represents the amount of taxes
payable and the applicable changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
EARNINGS PER SHARE -- In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS No.
128, Earnings Per Share. The Company adopted SFAS No. 128 for the year
ended December 31, 1997. SFAS No. 128 simplifies the standards required under
current accounting rules for computing earnings per share and replaces the
presentation of primary earnings per share and fully diluted earnings per share
with a presentation of basic earnings per share Earnings per Share and
diluted earnings per share Earnings per Share -- Assuming Dilution.
Earnings per Share excludes dilution and is determined by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Earnings per Share -- Assuming Dilution reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Earnings per
Share -- Assuming Dilution is computed similarly to fully diluted earnings per
share under previous accounting rules.
Earnings per Share was computed using 8,230,011 shares the aggregate
number of shares issued in connection with the acquisition of entities accounted
for using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for periods prior
to July 3, 1996 date of inception. The 4,753,414 shares issued in connection
with the organization of Metals USA, including shares issued to management, were
considered to be issued and outstanding from the date of inception without
regard to the date such shares were actually issued. The 6,785,000 shares issued
in connection with the IPO and the 11,693,499 shares issued in connection with
the
34
METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
entities acquired using the purchase method of accounting have been included
in the Earnings per Share computation only from their respective dates of
issuance, resulting in weighted average shares of 8,341,480 for the year ended
December 31, 1997. Earnings per Share -- Assuming Dilution differs from the
Earnings per Share computation due to the inclusion of stock options that were
dilutive.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION -- Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, allows
entities to choose between the fair value based method of accounting for
employee stock options or similar equity instruments and the intrinsic,
value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
The Company has elected to account for stock options or similar equity
instruments using the intrinsic, value-based method of accounting prescribed in
APB No. 25.
2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
POOLING TRANSACTIONS
On September 26, 1997, Metals USA completed the acquisition of all the
capital stock of Jeffreys Steel Company, Inc. Jeffreys in a business
combination accounted for as a pooling-of-interests transaction in
accordance with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16
APB No. 16, Business Combinations. Jeffreys is headquartered in
Mobile, Alabama, and is engaged in the wholesale and retail sale of steel.
Jeffreys has historically reported on a July 31 fiscal year-end. For purposes of
the merger with Metals USA, the accompanying financial statements reflect
Jeffreys on a calendar year-end basis effective January 1, 1996. The historical
financial information of Jeffreys for the year ended July 31, 1995 has been
included in the Company consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 1995. The net sales and net income of Jeffreys for the period from
August 1, 1995, through December 31, 1995, were $510 and $10, respectively.
The net income of Jeffreys for this transition period is included in the
accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders' equity as an adjustment to
retained earnings in order to conform their fiscal year to that of the Company.
On November 20, 1997, Metals USA completed the acquisition of all the
capital stock of Wayne Steel, Inc. Wayne in a business combination
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests transaction in accordance with the
requirements of APB No. 16. Wayne operates as a wholesaler and processor of
steel and aluminum flat rolled products and is headquartered in Wooster, Ohio.
Prior to the acquisition by Metals USA, the shareholders of Wayne had elected to
be taxed as an S Corporation; accordingly, any federal income tax liabilities
for the periods prior to the acquisition date were the responsibility of the
respective stockholders. For purposes of these consolidated financial
statements, federal income taxes have been provided as if Wayne had filed C
Corporation tax returns for the pre-acquisition periods, with the current income
tax provisions reflected in the consolidated financial statements as increases
to additional paid-in capital. Collectively, Metals USA issued 8,230,011 shares
of common stock in exchange for all of the capital stock of Jeffreys and Wayne.
The unaudited aggregate pre-acquisition net sales and net income for Jeffreys
and Wayne during 1997 were $2101 and $73, respectively. There were no
transactions between Metals USA, Jeffreys or Wayne during periods prior to these

The Industrial Revenue Bonds the IRBs are payable in installments
ranging from monthly to annual with variable interest ranging from 435% to
661% per annum at December 31, 1997 and mature from May 1, 2003 to May 1, 2009.
The IRBs are secured by real estate and equipment acquired with proceeds from
these bonds with a net book value of $212 at December 31, 1997. The IRBs place
various restrictions on certain of the Company subsidiaries, including but not
limited to maintenance of required insurance coverage, maintenance of certain
financial ratios, limits on capital expenditures, maintenance of tangible net
worth and letters of credit.
Concurrent with the IPO, the Company obtained an initial $1500 unsecured
revolving credit facility the Original Credit Facility which was used to
fund acquisitions, refinance certain indebtedness of the acquired companies and
for general corporate and working capital requirements. In January 1998, the
Company obtained a $500 unsecured revolving credit facility the Interim
Credit Facility to meet its acquisition related cash requirements pending the
completion of an extension and modification of the Original Credit Facility to
provide for up to $3000 of borrowing availability. The closing of the extension
and modification of the $3000 credit facility the Credit Facility on
February 11, 1998 stipulated the termination of the Interim Credit Facility. The
Credit Facility matures in February 2003, bears interest at the bank prime
rate or LIBOR, at Metals USA option, plus an applicable margin based on the
ratio of funded debt to cash flows as defined. An annual commitment fee of up
to 1/4% is payable on any unused portion of the Credit Facility. The Company
will use the Credit Facility to fund acquisitions, make capital expenditures,
refinance debt of the companies acquired and for general working capital
requirements. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by the pledge of
all of the capital stock of each of the Company material subsidiaries as
defined. In connection with the IPO, the Mergers and the 1997 Subsequent
Acquisitions, the revolving credit facility and certain other obligations
outstanding as of December 31, 1996 including certain obligations of the
acquired companies were repaid with the borrowings under the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with various affirmative
and negative covenants including: i the maintenance of certain financial
ratios, ii restrictions on additional indebtedness, iii restrictions on
liens, guarantees and dividends, iv obtaining the lenders' consent with
respect to certain individual acquisitions, and v maintenance of a specified
level of consolidated net worth. At December 31, 1997, the Company was precluded
from the payment of dividends under the terms of the Credit Facility.
On February 11, 1998, the Company completed the sale of $2000 aggregate
principal amount of the Company 8 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 the
Notes. The Company received $1945 of net cash proceeds before expected
expenses of $08 upon closing. The Company used $1793 of such proceeds to
repay the borrowings outstanding under the Original Credit Facility and Interim
Credit Facility on February 11, 1998. As of February 12, 1998, the entire amount
of the Credit Facility was available to the Company.
The Notes call for semi-annual interest payments on February 15 and August
15 of each year, beginning August 15, 1998 and mature on February 15, 2008. The
Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any
time on or after February 15, 2003, at the following redemption prices:
2003 -- 104313%; 2004 -- 102875%; 2005 -- 101438%; thereafter -- 10000 together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time on or prior to February 15, 2001, the
Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
originally issued with the net proceeds of one or more offerings of the common
stock of the Company, at a redemption price equal to 108625% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the

date of such redemption; provided that at least 65% of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes originally issued remains outstanding immediately after such
redemption. The Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company
current and future subsidiaries, and contain certain covenants restricting
additional indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates, asset sales,
investments, payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries and mergers and
acquisitions of subsidiaries. The Notes are subordinate to borrowings under the
Credit Facility and will rank PARI PASSU in right of payment with all other
future subordinated debt of the Company and will rank senior to other
indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinated in right of payment
to the Notes. The Company has agreed, for the benefit of all holders of the
Notes, that it will file a registration statement within 60 days after the
issuance of the Notes relating to an exchange offer for the Notes under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK
Metals USA effected a 13581-for-one stock split on April 21, 1997 for each
share of $01 par value common stock Common Stock then outstanding. In
addition, Metals USA increased the number of authorized shares of Common Stock
to 50,000,000 and the authorized shares of Restricted Common Stock, as defined
below, to 3,122,914 and authorized 5,000,000 shares of $001 par value preferred
stock, which may be designated in the future. The effects of the Common Stock
split and the increase in the shares of authorized Common Stock have been
retroactively reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and in the
accompanying notes.
In connection with its organization and initial capitalization, Metals USA
issued 135,810 shares of Common Stock at $001 per share to Notre Capital
Ventures II, L.L.C. Notre. Notre received 3,232,104 additional shares at
approximately $001 per share in exchange for the contribution of incurred
expenses in December 1996.
In December 1996, 400,000 shares of Common Stock were sold to management at
$01 per share. During the first and second quarters of 1997, Metals USA issued
a total of 985,500 shares of Common Stock to management of and consultants to
Metals USA at a price of $01 per share. As a result, Metals USA has recorded a
non-recurring, non-cash compensation charge of $36 in 1996 and $60 in 1997,
representing the difference between the amount paid for the shares and the
estimated fair value of the shares on the date of sale, as if the Founding
Companies were combined.
RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK
In April 1997, Notre exchanged 3,122,914 shares of Common Stock for an
equal number of shares of restricted voting common stock Restricted Common
Stock. The holder of Restricted Common Stock is entitled to elect one member
of Metals USA Board of Directors and to 055 of one vote for each share held
on all other matters on which they are entitled to vote.
41
METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
Each share of Restricted Common Stock will automatically convert into
Common Stock on a share-for-share basis a in the event of a disposition of
such share of Restricted Common Stock by the holder thereof other than a
disposition which is a distribution by a holder to its partners or beneficial
owners or a transfer to a related party of such holder as defined, b in the
event any person acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, or c in the event any person offers to acquire 15% or
more of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock.
After July 1, 1998, Metals USA may elect to convert any outstanding shares
of Restricted Common Stock into shares of Common Stock in the event 80% or more
of the outstanding shares of Restricted Common Stock have been converted into
shares of Common Stock.
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On July 11, 1997 the Company completed its IPO, issuing to the public
5,900,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $1000 per share, resulting
in net proceeds to the Company of $501 after deducting underwriting commissions
and discounts. On August 12, 1997, the Company sold 885,000 shares of Common
Stock pursuant to the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters. The
Company realized net proceeds from the sale of $82.
9. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
In April 1997, Metals USA stockholders approved the Company 1997
Long-Term Incentive Plan the Plan, which provides for the granting or
awarding of incentive or non-qualified stock options NQSOs, stock
appreciation rights, restricted or deferred stock, dividend equivalents and
other incentive awards to officers, key employees and consultants to Metals USA.
The number of shares authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plan is
limited to 13% of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
The terms of the option awards are established by the Compensation Committee of
Metals USA Board of Directors. These options will vest at the rate of 20% per
year, commencing on the first anniversary of the IPO or date of grant and will
expire ten years from the date of grant or three months following termination of
employment. The Company did not issue any stock options prior to January 1,
1996. Options granted in 1996 were attributable to an acquired company that was
accounted for as a pooling-of-interest business combination. Those options
were converted at the applicable share conversion ratio specified in the merger
agreement and exchanged for Company options issued under the Plan.
NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' STOCK PLAN
Metals USA 1997 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Plan the Directors'
Plan, which was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by Metals
USA stockholders in April 1997, provides for i the automatic grant to each
non-employee director serving at the consummation of the IPO of an option to
purchase 10,000 shares, ii the automatic grant to each non-employee director
of an option to purchase 10,000 shares upon such person initial election as a
director, and iii an automatic annual grant at each annual meeting of
stockholders thereafter of an option to purchase 5,000 shares to each
non-employee director at which meeting such director is re-elected or remains a
director, unless such annual meeting is held within three months of such
person initial election as a director. All options will have an exercise price
per share equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of
grant and are immediately vested and expire on the earlier of ten years from the
date of grant or one year after termination of service as a director. The
Directors' Plan also permits non-employee directors to elect to receive, in lieu
of cash directors' fees, shares or credits representing deferred shares at
future settlement dates, as selected by the director. The number of shares or
deferred shares received will equal the number of shares of Common
42

Stock which, at the date the fees would otherwise be payable, will have an

At December 31, 1997, exercisable options for shares of Common Stock were
61,440 at a weighted average price of $681 per share and 40,000 at a weighted
average price of $1000 per share.
The Company used the Black-Scholes model to calculate the estimated
fair-value of stock options and similar awards. The model requires the use
of a number of subjective assumptions including: i risk free rate of return,
ii expected price volatility of the Common Stock, iii expected dividend
yield and iv estimated life of the option. Principal assumptions used in
estimating the fair-value of the Company stock options using the
Black-Scholes model were as follows                      DECEMBER 31,
1997    1996
Risk free rate of return.    618%   632%
Expected price volatility.    433%   460%
Expected dividend yield.   --        Expected life of the option in
75    75
The Company applies APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting
for its stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option
plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant rate, consistent
with the methodology prescribed under the SFAS No. 123, the Company net income
and earnings per share would have been reduced by the amortization of the
estimated fair value of stock options over the applicable vesting period of such
awards. The following pro forma disclosures may not be representative of similar
future disclosures because: i additional options may be granted in future
years and ii the computations used to estimate the fair value of the stock
options are subject to
43

10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
PROFIT-SHARING PLANS
Certain subsidiaries of the Company provide various defined contributions
savings plans for their employees the Plans. The Plans cover substantially
all full-time employees of such subsidiaries. Participants vest at varying rates
ranging from full vesting upon participation to those that provide for vesting
to begin after three years of service and are fully vested after seven years.
Certain Plans provide for a deferral option that allows employees to elect to
contribute a portion of their pay into the plan and provide for a discretionary
profit sharing contribution by the individual subsidiary. Generally the
subsidiaries match a portion of the amount deferred by participating employees.
Contributions for the profit sharing portion of the plan are generally at the
discretion of the individual subsidiary board of directors. The aggregate
contributions to the Plans were $9, $2 and $2 for the years ended December
31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN AND TRUST
Under the provisions of an employee stock ownership plan ESOP and its
related trust, Jeffreys made annual contributions to the plan which were
invested in stock of Jeffreys and other qualifying securities for the benefit of
Jeffreys' employees. The plan provided for Jeffreys' purchases of employee
shares to be paid in cash and with the issuance of a note payable. Effective
September 26, 1997, the participation was frozen. Concurrent with the merger
with Metals USA, ESOP shares were exchanged for shares of Metals USA common
stock.
LEVERAGED ESOP ARRANGEMENT
The following disclosure has been restated to reflect the equivalent shares
of Metals USA common stock that were issued in connection with the acquisition
of Jeffreys.
Jeffreys' ESOP held 434,616 shares of stock prior to the purchase of
735,384 shares of outstanding stock from a majority stockholder for $531 per
share. The ESOP borrowed the funds to purchase such stock and Jeffreys
guaranteed the repayment of this loan. Jeffreys will repay this loan, plus
interest, through deductible contributions to the plan. As Jeffreys makes
contributions to the plan, which reduces the principal on the note, the plan
will release the corresponding shares related to the reduction in the note
principal. At the point when these
44
METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
shares are no longer specifically secured by the note payable, they will be
allocated to the individual participants of the plan and considered earned by
those employees at that time. Jeffreys accounts for its ESOP in accordance with
Statement of Position 93-6 SOP 93-6, Employers' Accounting for Employee
Stock Ownership Plans. Accordingly, the debt of the ESOP is recorded as
long-term debt and the shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned
compensation. As shares are released from collateral, Jeffreys reports
compensation expense equal to the current estimated market price of the shares.
ESOP share compensation expense was $4, $6 and $6 for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Since the obligation is secured by the shares purchased and the note is
guaranteed by Jeffreys, all amounts relating to this transaction are considered
unearned compensation of the employees until such time as the note is deemed
paid and the corresponding shares are released to the individual participants of
the plan. The balance in unearned compensation at December 31, 1997 and 1996 of
$15 and $18, respectively, results from the leveraged ESOP stock purchase less
the deemed release of shares at cost.
The activity relating to the ESOP shares was as follows                           YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1997    1996    1995
Allocated shares at beginning of year..  795,639  710,970  635,856
Shares deemed released for the current period.   87,165   84,669   75,114

Total ESOP shares.. 1,170,000 1,170,000 1,170,000
In accordance with SOP 93-6, additional paid-in capital is adjusted
whenever the market value of the shares released is more or less than the cost
of the shares released. The increase in additional paid-in capital attributable
to this difference in market value and cost was $1 and $2 for the years ended
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS
The Company minimum lease obligations under certain long-term
non-cancelable lease agreements for office space, warehouse space and equipment
are as follows: 1998 -- $64; 1999 -- $58; 2000 -- $51; 2001 -- $48;
2002 -- $37; thereafter -- $263.
The Company paid approximately $30, $4 and $5 in rent expense during the
years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, under operating
leases. Certain of these leases are with affiliated individuals and companies
see Note 12.
CONTINGENCIES
Subsidiaries of the Company are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits
and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company
believes the resolution of these matters and the incurrence of their related
costs and expenses should not have a material adverse effect on the Company
consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
12. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions with directors, officers, employees including affiliates of
the foregoing or affiliates of the Company must be at terms that are no less
favorable to the Company than those available from third parties and must be
approved in advance by a majority of disinterested members of the Board of
Directors.
In connection with the Mergers and certain of the subsequent acquisitions,
subsidiaries of the Company have entered into a number of lease arrangements for
facilities and equipment. These lease arrangements are for periods ranging from
10 to 20 years. Lease payments for these items in respect of the years ended
45
METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 were $13, $1 and $1, respectively. Future
commitments in respect of these leases are included in the schedule of minimum
lease payments in Note 11.
At December 31, 1997 and 1996 the aggregate principal amount of notes
receivable held by the Company were $8 and $1, respectively. Interest accrues
on the notes at rates ranging from 75% to 80% per annum. The notes call for
regular periodic payments of principal and interest and mature at varying dates
through March 1, 2007. The notes are secured by liens on specific assets of the
affiliates and personnel guarantees of the individuals. As of December 31, 1997,
the notes were current as to payment terms.
13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS UNAUDITED
Subsequent to December 31, 1997, Metals USA acquired eight additional
companies, including Independent Metals Co., Inc., Mark Metals, Inc., Metalmart,
Inc., National Manufacturing, Inc., Pacific Metal Company, The Levinson Steel
Company, Inc., Western Awning Company, Inc and the assets of Seaboard Steel and
Iron Corporation. The aggregate consideration paid by Metals USA for these
acquisitions consists of approximately $397 in cash and 2,989,919 shares of
Common Stock, plus the assumption of indebtedness of approximately $459. The
consideration paid by Metals USA for each of these acquisitions was determined
by negotiation and was based primarily upon the pro forma adjusted net income
for each entity.
On March 23, 1998, the Company announced that it has agreed to make an
offer for all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Ideal Metal Inc.
Ideal at a cash price of CAN$525 per share. The cash paid with respect to
the offer would total approximately CAN$570. The offer is subject to the valid
deposit of not less than 66 2/3% of the common shares of Ideal. The offer is
subject to other usual conditions, including the receipt of any required
regulatory approval, and the absence of material adverse changes. As an
inducement to making the offer, Ideal has entered into a support agreement with
the Company pursuant to which Ideal has agreed to support the offer and to pay
the Company a compensatory fee of CAN$25 in certain circumstances, including if
a competing offer is made.
The Company has been advised by the Board of Directors of Ideal the
Board that it unanimously recommends that shareholders accept the offer and
tender their shares in response and that, based on advice from its financial
advisors and other considerations, the Board has determined that the offer is
fair from a financial point of view and is in the best interests of Ideal
shareholders. Additionally, Ideal directors have expressed the intention to
deposit their Ideal shares in the offer. Furthermore, 146670 Canada Inc. has
informed the Board that it intends to tender its 653% interest in Ideal in
response to the offer.
Ideal is a processor and distributor of non-ferrous specialty metals with
locations in Montreal, Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver, as well as Pittsburgh
and Lansdale, Pennsylvania and Loudon, Tennessee. Ideal had revenue in 1997 of
approximately U.S.$1300. Ideal shares are publicly traded on the Montreal
exchange.

commercial and residential contractors in the construction of sun rooms,
solariums, walkways, canopies and coverings, aluminum support structures, as
well as for facia coverings for retail buildings. Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone
products are produced in five manufacturing plants. The products are marketed
and sold to contractors, architects and wholesale distributors through 36 sales
and distribution outlets across the United States, primarily concentrated in the
Sunbelt.
Texas Aluminum has historically reported on a June 30 fiscal year end,
whereas Cornerstone has historically reported on a December 31 year end. For
purposes of combined presentation, Texas Aluminum began reporting on a calendar
year end basis effective January 1, 1996. Cornerstone began operations on April
1, 1995 as further discussed below. Accordingly, the year ended June 30, 1994
includes the operations of Texas Aluminum, the year ended June 30, 1995 includes
the operations of Texas Aluminum for the twelve months ended June 30, 1995
combined with the operations of Cornerstone for the nine months ended December
31, 1995, and the year ended December 31, 1996 includes Texas Aluminum and
Cornerstone for the twelve months ended December 31, 1996. The net sales and net
income of Texas Aluminum for the period from July 1, 1995 through December 31,
1995 were $15,547 and $579, respectively. The net sales and net income of
Cornerstone for the period from July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 were
$3,671 and $165, respectively. The net income of Texas Aluminum for this
transition period is included in the accompanying statements of stockholders'
equity as an adjustment to retained earnings in order to conform the fiscal
years of these combined companies.
Intercompany transactions and ending balances among Texas Aluminum, CMC,
CBP, CPC and CAC have been eliminated except for certain transactions and
balances for the year ended June 30, 1995 which could not be eliminated due to
the combining of year ends See Note 12.
Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone and its stockholders entered into a merger
agreement with Metals USA, Inc. Metals USA pursuant to which all of Texas
Aluminum/Cornerstone outstanding shares of capital stock were exchanged for
cash and shares of Metals USA common stock concurrently with the consummation of
the initial public offering the Offering of Metals USA common stock, see
Note 13.
The financial statements for the period from January 1, 1997 through July
10, 1997 are presented for purposes of complying with certain reporting
requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission and are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market instruments with
original maturities of three months or less.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the last-in, first-out LIFO method for Texas Aluminum and the
first-in, first-out FIFO method for Cornerstone.
53
TEXAS ALUMINUM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND AFFILIATES
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method at rates based upon
the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of cash equivalents approximate their fair value. The
carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value at the applicable
balance sheet dates. The fair value of such notes receivable was based on
expected cash flows discounted using current rates at which similar loans would
be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. The fair value of the notes
payable is estimated based on interest rates for the same or similar debt
offered to Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone having the same or similar remaining
maturities and collateral requirements. The carrying amounts of notes payable
approximate fair value at the applicable balance sheet dates.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments, which potentially subject Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone
to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash deposits, trade
accounts and notes receivable. Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone places its cash with
several financial institutions limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one
financial institution. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
accounts and notes receivable are within the home improvement and general
construction industry. Credit is extended once appropriate credit history and
references have been obtained. Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful
accounts are made periodically as circumstances warrant based upon the
expected collectibility of all such accounts. Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone
periodically reviews the credit history of its customers and generally does not
require collateral for the extension of credit.
INCOME TAXES
Texas Aluminum accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES SFAS
109. Under SFAS 109, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on
enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. The principal items resulting
in the differences are different depreciation methods, use of the allowance
method for bad debts, and different inventory capitalization methods. Valuation
allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred assets to the
amount to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the year and
the change during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Cornerstone, with the consent of its stockholders, elected to be taxed
under sections of the federal and state income tax laws which provide that, in
lieu of corporate income taxes, the stockholders separately account for
Cornerstone items of income, deductions, losses and credits on their
individual income tax returns. The financial statements will not include a
provision for income taxes credits as long as the S Corporation election
remains in effect. As long as Cornerstone S Corporation income tax election
remains in effect, Cornerstone may, from time to time, pay dividends to its
stockholders in amounts sufficient to enable the stockholders to pay the taxes
due on their share of Cornerstone items of income, deductions, losses, and
credits which have been allocated to them for reporting on their individual
income tax returns.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair
market value of assets acquired and is being amortized on the straight-line
method over 40 years. Other intangibles include covenants not to
54
TEXAS ALUMINUM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND AFFILIATES
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS
compete, trademarks, patents and consulting agreements, which are being
amortized over their respective lives ranging from 5-15 years. Accumulated
amortization totaled $23 and $65 as of June 30, 1995 and December 31, 1996,
respectively.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF SFAS 121 in March 1995. SFAS
121 requires that long-lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used
by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone adopted SFAS No. 121 on January 1, 1996.
The impact of adopting this standard did not have a material impact on the
results of operations.

Texas Aluminum has three classes of stock which include Class A voting
common stock, Class B non-voting common stock and cumulative, participating
preferred stock. The cumulative, participating preferred stock includes a
conversion right which can be exercised by the holder in the event of the sale
or transfer of more than fifty percent of the common stock or assets of the
corporation or the consolidation, merger or other reorganization or similar
transfer of a majority of the corporation assets or common stock. The
conversion option allows the holder to convert a preferred share into two shares

Treasury stock transactions are a result of employees exercising their put

Aluminum cancels treasury stock and the corresponding Class B common stock or
preferred stock when the related note payable is fully paid See Note 8.
8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
401K DEFERRED PROFIT SHARING PLAN AND TRUST
Texas Aluminum adopted a 401k salary deferral/savings plan effective July
1, 1989, for the benefit of all its employees. Employees electing to participate
in the plan may contribute up to 15% of annual compensation, limited to the
maximum amount that can be deducted for income tax purposes each year.
Texas Aluminum, at its discretion, has the option to match the employee
contribution each plan year. Texas Aluminum elected to make contributions of
$24, $23 and $22 for the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1995 and December 31,
1996, respectively. For the period from January 1, 1997 through July 10, 1997,
Texas Aluminum has accrued $20 for their contribution to the plan.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN AND TRUST
Texas Aluminum had an employee stock ownership plan and trust. Under the
provisions of this plan, Texas Aluminum made annual contributions to the plan
which were invested in stock and other qualifying
59
TEXAS ALUMINUM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND AFFILIATES
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS
securities of Texas Aluminum for the benefit of Texas Aluminum employees.
Effective July 1, 1989, the ESOP was frozen. As a result, all participants'
accounts became fully vested on that date.
Under the provisions of the plan, employees received a put option which
required Texas Aluminum to purchase their shares at fair market value.
Additionally, Texas Aluminum had the right of first refusal for any shares sold
by the employee. The plan provided for Texas Aluminum purchases of employee
shares to be paid in cash and with the issuance of a note payable.
In January 1997, Texas Aluminum terminated the plan and gave its employees
the option to receive a cash distribution, roll their account balances into an
IRA account, or have the account distributed in Texas Aluminum stock. A
stockholder and an affiliated entity purchased the shares of Texas Aluminum
common and preferred stock which were tendered by the Company employees upon
termination of the ESOP plan.
Texas Aluminum practice has generally been to purchase shares from
employees at $16 per share for the Class B non-voting common stock and $100 per
share for the cumulative, participating preferred stock. The distribution under
the termination is based on these prices. Management believes that these prices
approximate fair value and has obtained valuations from independent appraisers
to assist them in their determination. In March 1997, Gene C. Elkins, a
shareholder of Texas Aluminum, purchased the shares tendered by employees who
opted for a cash distribution. The remaining employees received shares of Texas
Aluminum stock. The put options were terminated upon the execution of these
transactions.

10. DIVESTITURE OF A RETAIL DIVISION
On June 30, 1993, Texas Aluminum divested its retail division under a
licensing agreement, whereby the Company transferred certain assets and existing
sales in exchange for $100 and the licensing agreement. The license grants the
licensee the right to sell certain proprietary products under the name of Air
Vent and/or Air Vent Awning Company. In accordance with the agreement, Texas
Aluminum is entitled to receive monthly license fees of $9 beginning on August
1, 1993, and continuing for a five-year period. These fees are included in other
income in the accompanying statements of income.
Under the terms of the agreement, the licensee has agreed to purchase the
merchandise used to market and install the products exclusively from Texas
Aluminum. During the term of the agreement, Texas Aluminum has agreed not to
compete with the licensee in the retail market in the state of Texas.

option has a one year term and is extendable up to four successive one-year
terms. Consideration for these options is $5 per quarter which shall be applied
towards the purchase price.
11. LICENSING AGREEMENT
Texas Aluminum entered into a licensing agreement in July 1992, whereby it
is required to pay licensing fees to a third party on the sale of certain
products. Texas Aluminum has capitalized $94 in costs incurred in connection
with obtaining the licensing agreement which are being amortized over the life
of the agreement. The unamortized balance of capitalized licensing costs was $78
and $66 as of June 30, 1995 and December 31, 1996, respectively. Total licensing
fees paid for the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1995, December 31, 1996 and for
the period from January 1, 1997 through July 10, 1997 were $36, $43, $64 and
$35, respectively.
12. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone has various transactions with affiliated
individuals and companies as follows   FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT LEASES
Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone leases certain facilities and equipment from
affiliated individuals and companies. Lease payments made to these affiliated
individuals and companies during the years ended June 30, 1994 and 1995 and
December 31, 1996 and the period from January 1, 1997 through July 10, 1997 were
$306, $541, $697 and $510, respectively.
In June 1996, Texas Aluminum sold certain equipment with a net book value
of $143 to an affiliated company. This equipment is being leased to Cornerstone
for $48 per year through December 2011. Also in June 1996, Cornerstone sold
certain equipment with a net book value of $120 to the same affiliated company.
This equipment is being leased to Texas Aluminum for $48 per year through
December 2011. These leases are being accounted for as capital leases. In
November 1996, Texas Aluminum sold certain machinery and equipment to this
affiliated company resulting in a gain of $242. Texas Aluminum is leasing this
machinery from the affiliated company for $72 per year through December 2001.
The resulting gain has been deferred and will be recognized over the term of the
lease.
NOTES RECEIVABLE
Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone has unsecured notes receivable from an
affiliated corporation of $546 as of December 31, 1996, which is included in
accounts and notes receivable from affiliates. This note accrues interest at 8%
and is due June 1, 2001.
Texas Aluminum/Cornerstone believes the related party transactions are on
terms no more or less favorable than what could have been obtained from third
parties.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Interstate Steel Supply Company and Affiliates Interstate is
comprised of the following companies under common control and ownership;
Interstate Steel Supply Company a Pennsylvania Subchapter S corporation
and its affiliates, Interstate Steel Supply Company of Pittsburgh a
Pennsylvania Subchapter S corporation, Interstate Steel Processing Company
a Pennsylvania Subchapter S corporation, Interstate Steel Supply Company
of Maryland a Maryland Subchapter S corporation and Warehouse Real Estate
Associates a Pennsylvania partnership. All intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in the accompanying combined financial statements.
Interstate is a carbon structural steel service center with operations in
Baltimore, MD, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, PA. Interstate services customers
primarily in the Northeast and Midatlantic regions of United States, ranging
from Virginia to Maine and west through Eastern Ohio. Interstate supplies
structural steel for steel buildings, bridges, shopping malls, shipbuilding,
railroad switch and gear manufacturers and electric power generating plants.
Approximately one-half of net sales include value-added processing services such
as saw cutting, shearing, flame cutting, cambering and tee-splitting.
Interstate exclusive of Warehouse Real Estate Associates, see Note 8 and
its shareholders entered into a definitive merger agreement with Metals USA,
Inc. Metals USA pursuant to which all of Interstate outstanding shares
of capital stock were exchanged for cash and shares of Metals USA common stock
concurrently with the consummation of the initial public offering the
Offering of Metals USA common stock See Note 8.
The financial statements for the period from January 1, 1997 through July
10, 1997 are presented for purposes of complying with certain reporting
requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission and are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market instruments with
original maturities of three months or less.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is primarily
determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation for buildings and equipment are based upon the estimated useful
lives of the various classes of assets, using the straight-line and the
declining balance method, respectively. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease using the
straight-line method.
68
INTERSTATE STEEL SUPPLY CO. AND AFFILIATES
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of cash equivalents approximate their fair value. The
fair value of the line-of-credit facilities and long-term debt are estimated
based on interest rates for the same or similar debt offered to Interstate
having the same or similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements. The
carrying amounts of the line-of-credit facility and long-term debt approximates
their fair value at the applicable balance sheet dates.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments, which potentially subject Interstate to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash deposits and, trade
account and note receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to
trade accounts receivable are within the Northeast and Midatlantic United
States. Credit is extended once appropriate credit history and references have
been obtained. Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made
periodically as circumstances warrant based upon the expected collectibility
of all such accounts. Interstate periodically reviews the credit history of its
customers and generally does not require collateral for the extension of credit.
INCOME TAXES
Interstate elected to be taxed under sections of the federal and state
income tax laws which provide that, in lieu of corporation income taxes, the
stockholders separately account for Interstate items of income, deductions,
losses and credits on their individual income tax returns. The financial
statements will not include a provision for income taxes credits as long as
the S Corporation election remains in effect. As long as Interstate S
Corporation income tax election remains in effect, Interstate may, from
time-to-time, pay dividends to its stockholders in amounts sufficient to enable
the stockholders to pay the taxes due on their share of Interstate items of
income, deductions, losses, and credits which has been allocated to them for
reporting on their individual income tax returns. Taxes on partnership income
accrue to the partners and, accordingly, are not reflected in the financial
statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF SFAS 121 in March 1995. SFAS
121 requires that long-lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used
by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Interstate adopted SFAS No. 121 on January 1, 1996. The impact of
adopting this standard did not have a material impact on the results of
operations.
2. INVENTORIES
Interstate utilizes the LIFO method of inventory accounting. If the
first-in first-out, FIFO method had been used for all inventories, their
carrying value would have been $11,466, $13,487 and $11,453 at December 31, 1995
and 1996, and July 10, 1997, respectively. Additionally, net income would have
been $1,030, $2,475, $3,146 and $1,816 for the years ended December 31, 1994,
1995, 1996 and for the period from January 1, 1997 through July 10, 1997,
respectively. During the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1996, Interstate
recorded favorable adjustments to cost of goods sold of approximately $90 and
$627, respectively. The adjustments were due to the lower costs associated with
the reduced quantities for certain items that prevailed in prior periods
compared to the cost prevailing in 1994 and 1996.

banks. The line-of-credit facilities bear interest at rates between 675% and
825% at December 31, 1996. The line-of-credit agreements require Interstate to
meet and maintain certain nonfinancial covenants, including the maintenance of
life insurance policies on the sole stockholder of Interstate Steel Supply

6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Interstate maintains profit-sharing plans which provide for voluntary
Company contributions at the discretion of the Board of Directors of up to 15%
of the salaries of eligible employees. Contributions of $260, $405, $472 and
$257 have been charged to operations for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995
and 1996 and for the period from January 1, 1997 through July 10, 1997,
respectively.
7. MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS
During 1996, Interstate had two customers, each of which accounted for
approximately 10% of net sales. Interstate did not have any major customers that
accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 1995 or 1994.
Interstate primarily acquires structural and plate steel, its most
significant inventory, from three suppliers. Those suppliers made up 19%, 17 and 10%, respectively, in purchases for the fiscal year ending December 31,
1996. The same suppliers accounted for 10%, 135%, and 20%, respectively, in
total steel purchased for the year ended December 31, 1995.
8. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On July 11, 1997, Metals USA, Inc. purchased all of the issued and
outstanding equity securities of Interstate, through the issuance of common
stock and cash pursuant to a definitive merger agreement dated May 1997.
Prior to the merger, Interstate made a cash distribution of approximately
$5,250 which represented Interstate estimated S Corporation accumulated
adjustment account. Had these distributions been made at December 31, 1996 or
June 30, 1997, the effect on Interstate balance sheet would have been to
increase liabilities by $5,250, and decrease stockholder equity by $5,250.
Interstate funded this distribution by using its existing credit facilities.
As described in Note 1, Warehouse Real Estate Associates will not be a
party to the merger. Following the sale of equipment described below,
approximately $1,800 of property and equipment, debt of $817 and other
obligations of approximately $133 which are included in the combined balance
sheet at December 31, 1996 will remain with Warehouse Real Estate Associates.
Concurrent with the merger, Interstate entered into agreements with Warehouse
Real Estate Associates to purchase certain equipment from Warehouse Real Estate
Associates in exchange for an existing note receivable, having a carrying value
of $530 at December 31, 1996. The value of the equipment approximates the value
of the note. Additionally, an affiliate of Interstate entered into a 10 year
lease with Warehouse Real Estate Associates with respect to certain real
property where Interstate conducts its operations for an annual lease payment of
$233. This annual lease amount will remain in effect for five years. At the end
of year five the annual rental will be redetermined. An affiliate of Interstate
has agreed to purchase the real estate at the end of year ten for the then
appraised fair market value of such property.
Prior to the merger, Interstate Steel Supply Company dividended a life
insurance policy to its sole stockholder, which had a book value at June 30,
1997 of approximately $1,183.
During July 1997, subsequent to the merger, $16,613 of Interstate debt
was repaid with advances from Metals USA.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Queensboro Steel Corporation Queensboro is a heavy carbon steel
service center and structural fabricator with operations in Wilmington and
Greensboro, North Carolina and Norfolk, Virginia. Queensboro markets its
products primarily in the Southeast region of the United States. Sales consist
principally of beams, angles, channels, sheet, plate, bar, tubing and fabricated
steel for buildings. Value-added processing includes shearing, bending,
drilling, tee-splitting, rolling, cambering, burning and coil processing.
Queensboro diversified customer base includes shipbuilding, transportation,
building construction, pulp and paper mills, chemical, public utility, farm
equipment, crane manufacturing, plant maintenance and other industries.
Queensboro and its shareholders entered into a definitive merger agreement
with Metals USA, Inc. Metals USA pursuant to which all of Queensboro
outstanding shares of capital stock were exchanged for cash and shares of Metals
USA common stock concurrently with the consummation of the initial public
offering the Offering of Metals USA common stock see Note 11.
The financial statements for the period from January 1, 1997 through July
10, 1997 are presented for purposes of complying with certain reporting
requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission and are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts in the 1994 and 1995 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1996 presentation. These reclassifications have
no effect on previously reported net income or stockholders' equity.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is primarily
determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method at rates based upon
the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets.
LONG-TERM CONTRACTS
Sales are recorded at the time products and materials are shipped or as
services are provided. Income from fabrication contracts are recognized by
applying estimated percentages-of-completion to the total estimated profit for
the respective contracts, commencing at the time the contracts are at least
one-tenth complete. The percentage-of-completion is determined by relating the
actual cost of work performed through year end to the total estimated cost of
the respective contracts. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted
contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in
job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those
arising from contract penalty

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS
provisions, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and
income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.
Contract costs include direct materials, direct labor and related overhead.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of the long-term debt is estimated based on interest rates
for the same or similar debt offered to Queensboro having the same or similar
remaining maturities and collateral requirements. The carrying amounts of
long-term debt approximates fair value at the applicable balance sheet dates.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments, which potentially subject Queensboro to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of trade account receivables.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are
within the Southeast region of the United States. Credit is extended once
appropriate credit history and references have been obtained. Adjustments to the
allowance for doubtful accounts are made periodically as circumstances warrant
based upon the expected collectibility of all such accounts. Queensboro
periodically reviews the credit history of its customers and generally does not
require collateral for the extension of credit.
INCOME TAXES
Queensboro, with the consent of its stockholders, elected to be taxed under
sections of the federal and state income tax laws which provide that, in lieu of
corporation income taxes, the stockholders separately account for Queensboro
items of income, deductions, losses and credits on their individual income tax
returns. The financial statements will not include a provision for income taxes
credits as long as the S Corporation election remains in effect. As long as
Queensboro S Corporation income tax election remains in effect, Queensboro
may, from time-to-time, pay dividends to its stockholders in amounts sufficient
to enable the stockholders to pay the taxes due on their share of Queensboro
items of income, deductions, losses, and credits which has been allocated to
them for reporting on their individual income tax returns.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF SFAS 121 in March 1995. SFAS
121 requires that long-lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used
by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Queensboro adopted SFAS No. 121 on January 1, 1996. The impact of
adopting this standard did not have a material impact on the results of
operations.
2. TRADE RECEIVABLES

3. INVENTORIES
Inventories of the steel service center consist primarily of unprocessed
steel and are carried at the lower of cost or market using the last-in,
first-out LIFO method. Inventories of the fabrication division $340 and $366
at December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively approximate the lower of cost or
market using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. If the FIFO cost method of
inventory valuation had been used for all inventories at December 31, 1995 and
1996 and July 10, 1997, inventories would have been $8,086, $9,776 and $10,671
and net income for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995, 1996 and for the
period from January 1, 1997 through July 10, 1997, would have been $1,324 1,882, $2,279 and $676, respectively.

REVOLVING LINE-OF-CREDIT
Queensboro has a $10,000 committed revolving line-of-credit facility with a
bank whereby Queensboro may borrow the lesser of i $10,000 or ii 80% of
eligible accounts receivable plus 60% of inventories. The agreement provides,
among other things, for restrictions on additional borrowings, capital
expenditures, investing, and the payment of dividends. The agreement also
requires the maintenance of certain working capital and debt-to-equity ratios,
minimum net worth, and furnishing periodic financial statements.
Additionally, Queensboro cash accounts are tied directly to the revolving
line-of-credit such that the line is increased automatically when checks
presented to the bank for payment exceed the funds available in Queensboro
bank accounts. At December 31, 1995 and 1996, outstanding checks approximating
$1,507 and $604, respectively, have been classified as long-term debt on the
balance sheet.
INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS
Queensboro secured financing for the construction and equipping of its
current steel processing facility located in Greensboro, North Carolina with
industrial revenue bonds. These industrial revenue bonds were issued by Guilford
County Industrial Facilities and Pollution Control Financing Authority and the
proceeds loaned to Queensboro on identical terms. As required by the terms of
the bond agreement, Queensboro has provided an irrevocable bank letter-of-credit
for up to $3,043 as security for the industrial revenue bonds, which expires May
15, 1997. The future maturities of the industrial revenue bonds have been
classified in accordance with established sinking fund requirements in
anticipation that the letter-of-credit will be renewed at the expiration date.
Queensboro has the option to have interest determined on a weekly, flexible
or fixed rate basis. The bonds were issued and have remained on a weekly rate
basis. The rate at December 31, 1996 was 445%. Interest is payable in arrears
on May 1, and November 1. Beginning May 1, 1998, the bond sinking fund
requirements will be payable in annual installments of $300 through May 1, 2008,
except for 1998, 2002 and 2006, for which years the installments will be $200.
Additional conditional mandatory redemption features exist for such items as
taxability of the bonds and expiration of the letter-of-credit agreement.
Optional prepayment features also exist.
This letter of credit agreement, as amended, contains various covenant
requirements similar to those of the revolving line-of-credit described above
and is collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.

In connection with a deferred compensation plan between Queensboro and
certain key employees, provision has been made for the future compensation which
is payable upon their death or retirement. At December 31, 1995 and 1996, $242
and $239, respectively, has been accrued under these contracts.
The deferred compensation is to be paid to the individuals or their
beneficiaries over a period of ten years commencing with the first business day
of the calendar month following the month of retirement or death.
The employment agreements with the employees mentioned in the preceding
paragraphs also provide that death benefits totaling $335 at December 31, 1996,
will be paid to their beneficiaries in the event these employees should die
while they are employees of Queensboro. Queensboro is the owner and beneficiary
of life insurance policies with a total face value of $853 on these employees.
In the event that a death benefit related to the employees mentioned above
should become payable, such benefit shall be in lieu of all deferred
compensation.
Queensboro also entered into a salary continuation agreement during 1992
which provides 50% salary continuation payments for up to ten years to the wife
of an officer upon death of that officer. The liability accrued for these
payments is $117 and $171 at December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
9. LEASE COMMITMENTS
Queensboro has leased facilities and equipment under non-cancelable
long-term agreements, which have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in
excess of one year as of December 31, 1996. Total rent expense related to such
leases aggregated $499, $417, and $417 and $221 for the years ended December 31,
1994, 1995, 1996 and for the period from January 1, 1997 through July 10, 1997,
respectively.
The future minimum rental commitments at December 31, 1996, under the
leases described above are due in future years as follows: 1997 280;
1998 93.
10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
At December 31, 1995 and 1996, Queensboro had a receivable from a
corporation related through common ownership of $32 and $34, respectively.
Queensboro provides certain administrative services to

QUEENSBORO STEEL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS
the affiliated corporation, for which it billed $274 in 1994, $370 in 1995, $344
in 1996 and $186 for the period from January 1, 1997 through July 10, 1997.
Queensboro leases fabrication shop facilities from an affiliated
partnership under operating lease terms see Note 9. Lease expense was $137 in
1994, 1995, 1996 and $73 for the period from January 1, 1997 through July 10,
1997.
11. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On April 4, 1997, Queensboro further amended its bank line-of-credit
agreement see Note 6 to extend the termination date to June 30, 1998. The debt
is classified as noncurrent as a result of this extension.
Queensboro made a cash distribution on April 11, 1997, of approximately
$5,040 which represents Queensboro estimated S corporation accumulated
adjustment account. To affect this transaction, Queensboro also entered into a
ninety-day, $3,000 bank loan collateralized by the accounts receivable and
inventory and personal guarantees of certain shareholders. Had these
transactions been made at December 31, 1996, the effect on Queensboro balance
sheet would have been to increase liabilities by $5,040 and decrease
stockholders' equity by $5,040. These transactions caused covenant violations
with respect to the debt disclosed in Note 6. On April 18, 1997, the bank waived
these covenants through July 11, 1997. Queensboro expects, on or before July 11,
1997, the above mentioned merger will have been consummated or the guarantors
will satisfy the $3,000 debt.
12. OTHER TRANSACTIONS
On July 11, 1997, Metals USA, purchased all of the issued and outstanding
equity securities of Queensboro, through the issuance of common stock and cash
pursuant to a definitive merger agreement dated May 1997.
Queensboro dividended its Wilmington facility to its stockholders
concurrently with the Merger. An affiliate of Queensboro entered into a
long-term lease for the facility which calls for monthly lease payments of $40.
At December 31, 1996 the carrying value of the facility was approximately $601.
Additionally, immediately prior to the Merger, Queensboro transferred the salary
continuation agreement described in the last paragraph of Note 8 to an entity
that is not a party to the Merger.
During July 1997, subsequent to the merger, $12,612 of Queensboro debt
was repaid with advances from Metals USA.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Affiliated Metals Company Affiliated is a high-volume flat rolled
steel processor, with operations in Granite City, Illinois and a newly
constructed facility in Butler, Indiana. The operating plants are strategically
located near primary steel producers. Affiliated purchases wide, coiled hot
rolled, cold rolled and galvanized flat rolled steel from primary producers and
pickles hot rolled and slits coils to narrower widths. Principal customers
include; consumer durable goods manufacturers, commercial transportation,
appliance, furniture, pallet rack, and automotive industries as well as
independent stamping operations. Service areas include Missouri, Kansas, Texas,
Oklahoma, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Iowa,
Illinois and Nebraska.
Affiliated Metals and its shareholders entered into a definitive merger
agreement with Metals USA, Inc. Metals USA pursuant to which all of
Affiliated Metal outstanding shares of capital stock were exchanged for cash
and shares of Metals USA common stock concurrently with the consummation of the
initial public offering the Offering of Metals common stock see Note 9.
The financial statements for the period from September 1, 1996 through July
10, 1997 are presented for purposes of complying with certain reporting
requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission and are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
ACCOUNTING PERIOD
Affiliated fiscal year is the fifty-two or fifty-three week period ending
the Saturday nearest to August 31. The results of operations and cash flows
include fifty-two weeks of activity for the periods ended August 31, 1996,
September 2, 1995, and September 3, 1994.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is primarily
determined using the specific identification method. Raw materials generally
represent 80% to 90% of Affiliated inventories.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment, including capitalized interest, is stated at cost,
net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed utilizing the
straight-line and accelerated methods at rates based upon the estimated useful
lives of the various classes of assets.
OTHER ASSETS
Other assets consists primarily of goodwill, net of accumulated
amortization. Goodwill is being amortized over a thirty year period using the
straight-line method. Affiliated periodically evaluates the propriety of the
carrying amount of goodwill using expected undiscounted cash flows. At September
2, 1995 and August 31, 1996 goodwill, net of accumulated amortization was $622
and $599, respectively.

AFFILIATED METALS COMPANY
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of the long-term debt is estimated based on interest rates
for the same or similar debt offered to Affiliated having the same or similar
remaining maturities and collateral requirements. The carrying amounts of
long-term debt approximate fair value at the applicable balance sheet dates.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments, which potentially subject Affiliated to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash deposits and, trade
account receivables. Affiliated places its cash with several financial
institutions limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one financial
institution. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
receivable are within the midwest and Great Lakes regions of the United States.
Affiliated had a credit risk concentration since two customers accounted for
approximately 27% of accounts receivable at August 31, 1996. For the fifty-two
weeks ended September 3, 1994, three customers accounted for 163%, 172%, and
111% of sales, respectively. For the fifty-two weeks ended September 2, 1995
and August 31, 1996, two of the same three customers accounted for 169% and
202%, and 145% and 140% of sales, respectively. For the period from September
1, 1996 through July 10, 1997, three customers accounted for 106%, 80% and
79% of sales, respectively. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers and provides allowances as deemed necessary. Credit is extended
once appropriate credit history and references have been obtained. Adjustments
to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made periodically as circumstances
warrant based upon the expected collectibility of all such accounts. Affiliated
periodically reviews the credit history of its customers and generally does not
require collateral for the extension of credit.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF SFAS 121 in March 1995. SFAS
121 requires that long-lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used
by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Affiliated adopted SFAS No. 121 on September 1, 1996. The impact of
adopting this standard did not have a material impact on the results of
operations.

Affiliated has obtained financing agreements from its lender that will
convert the construction note to a term loan note payable and a Small Business
Administration SBA note payable in amounts up to $1,600 and $1,000,
respectively. The new notes will be secured by certain machinery and equipment,
certain land and building, and personal guarantees of common stockholders. The
term loan note payable will bear interest at a fixed rate based on prime plus
05% at closing during the first five years and will adjust after year five and
will be payable in monthly installments of principal and interest over a
ten-year period from the date of conversion. The SBA note payable will bear
interest at a rate yet to be determined and will be payable in monthly
installments of principal and interest over a 20-year period from the date of
conversion. Because Affiliated had the intent and ability to convert the
construction note payable on a long-term basis, the August 31, 1996
classification and future maturities have been presented under the terms of the
new agreements. In April 1997, Affiliated entered into an agreement to extend
until September 1997 the financing agreements related to the construction note
payable.

Affiliated revolving line of credit provides for borrowings up to $12,000
limited to a borrowing base defined in the agreement as a percentage of
eligible accounts receivable and inventories. The revolving line of credit
agreement requires that all cash receipts of Affiliated be deposited directly
into a lockbox account and applied against the line of credit. Funds are then
drawn from the line of credit as checks are disbursed. Additionally, the
agreement requires, among other things, that Affiliated maintain certain minimum
ratios, including net income, tangible net worth, leverage, cash flow coverage,
and limits on capital expenditures. At August 31, 1996, future principal
payments of long-term debt, as adjusted to reflect the financing agreements, are
as follows  $  10,358

In February 1997, Affiliated amended its revolving credit facility, which
reduced the interest to prime, increased the available borrowing up to $16,000
and extended the maturity to August 31, 1998.
4. REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
Redeemable preferred stock consists of 1,680 shares of authorized at a par
value of $119048 per share. Shares issued and outstanding at August 31, 1996
and September 2, 1995, were 600 and 840 respectively. The stock is subject to
mandatory redemption of 20 shares per month beginning in March 1992 and
continuing for 84 months. In both fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995, 240 shares were
redeemed at a price of $119048 per share. Dividends are calculated cumulatively
but not compounded on a daily basis at the rate of 1% over prime. Dividends
are paid on each redemption date.
5. COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT
In March 1992, in connection with a Securities Purchase Agreement related
to the purchase of Affiliated, Affiliated issued one warrant to an investor in
consideration for $100. The warrant is exercisable at an exercise price of $01
per share into 344% or 3,146 shares of Affiliated common stock on a fully
diluted basis. The holder of the warrant also may put the warrant or a portion
thereof to Affiliated through November 1999, unless it would cause Affiliated to
be in default of its debt covenants. The put price is determined by the
ownership percentage of the warrants multiplied by the greater of either fair
value of Affiliated, a multiple of earnings before income taxes, interest, and
depreciation and amortization, and book value, all as defined in the agreement.
In addition, the agreement provides the holder of the warrant with certain
registration rights under the Securities Act of 1933 the Securities Act to
cause Affiliated to register the shares of common stock to be received from the
exercise of the warrant. The agreement also provides the holder of the warrant
with certain piggyback registration rights which allow the holder of the
warrant to register his common stock in the event Affiliated files a
registration statement under the Securities Act.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Southern Alloy of America, Inc. Southern Alloy, a North Carolina
corporation, is a specialty metal service center located in Salisbury, North
Carolina specializing in ferrous and non-ferrous continuous, centrifugal and
static cast bar stock. Southern Alloy performs a number of metal processing
services, including precision saw cutting, precision and semi-finished
machining, drilling and milling operations. Southern Alloy customers are
comprised of original equipment manufacturers and machine shops servicing the
fluid power, power transmission, material handling and textile machinery
industries. Market areas are principally located in the Southeastern United
States.
Southern Alloy and its shareholders entered into a definitive merger
agreement with Metals USA, Inc. Metals USA pursuant to which all of
Southern Alloy outstanding shares of capital stock were exchanged for cash and
shares of Metals USA common stock concurrently with the consummation of the
initial public offering the Offering of Metals USA common stock. See Note
10.
The financial statements for the period from January 1, 1997 through July
10, 1997 are presented for purposes of complying with certain reporting
requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission and are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts in the 1995 financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the 1996 presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on
previously reported net income or stockholders' equity.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is primarily
determined using the specific identification method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method at rates based upon
the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of cash surrender value of life insurance policies
approximate their fair value. The fair value of the long-term debt is estimated
based on interest rates for the same or similar debt offered to Southern Alloy
having the same or similar remaining maturities and collateral requirements. The
carrying amounts of long-term debt approximate fair value at the applicable
balance sheet dates.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments, which potentially subject Southern Alloy to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash deposits and, trade
account and note receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to
trade accounts receivable are within the Southeastern United States.
Additionally, Southern Alloy has one customer that accounts for approximately
10% of net sales. Credit is extended once appropriate credit history and
references have been obtained. Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful
accounts are made periodically as circumstances warrant based upon the
expected collectibility of all such accounts. Southern Alloy periodically
reviews the credit history of its customers and generally does not require
collateral for the extension of credit.
INCOME TAXES
Southern Alloy, with the consent of its stockholders, elected to be taxed
under sections of the federal and state income tax laws which provide that, in
lieu of corporation income taxes, the stockholders separately account for
Southern Alloy items of income, deductions, losses and credits on their
individual income tax returns. The financial statements will not include a
provision for income taxes credits as long as the S Corporation election
remains in effect. As long as Southern Alloy S Corporation income tax election
remains in effect, Southern Alloy may, from time-to-time, pay dividends to its
stockholders in amounts sufficient to enable the stockholders to pay the taxes
due on their share of Southern Alloy items of income, deductions, losses, and
credits which has been allocated to them for reporting on their individual
income tax returns.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF SFAS 121 in March 1995. SFAS
121 requires that long-lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used
by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Southern Alloy adopted SFAS No. 121 on January 1, 1996. The impact
of adopting this standard did not have a material impact on the results of
operations.
2. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment consists of the following                               DECEMBER 31,

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS
line-of-credit agreement with NationsBank N.A. NationsBank, which expires
on July 31, 1997. This agreement provides a maximum borrowing limit of $2,000

1996. The borrowing base under the new NationsBank line of credit is limited to
80% of eligible receivables as defined by the agreement plus 50% of the eligible
inventory. Southern Alloy had $75 of unused availability under the
line-of-credit at December 31, 1996. The line is secured by accounts receivable,
inventory, equipment and guarantees of Southern Investments, The Development
Group, Inc. both of which are affiliates of Southern Alloy and stockholders of
Southern Alloy.
The new NationsBank agreement contains restrictive covenants which, among
other things, require Southern Alloy to maintain certain financial ratios, limit
capital expenditures and bonuses and restrict future indebtedness. At December
31, 1996, Southern Alloy was in compliance with, or had obtained all necessary
waivers regarding instances of non-compliance with the terms of the loan
agreement.
4. LONG-TERM DEBT
Long-term obligations consist of three notes payable to Amada Cutting
Technologies, Inc. The notes bear interest at rates ranging from 90% to 94%
and are payable in monthly installments totaling $4 through April 1997, and $1
from May 1997 to December 1997. The notes are secured by related equipment.

10. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On July 11, 1997, Metals USA, Inc. purchased all of the issued and
outstanding equity securities of Southern Alloy, through the issuance of common
stock and cash pursuant to a definitive merger agreement dated May 1997.
Concurrent with the Merger, Southern Alloy entered into an agreement with a
related party to lease certain real property for an annual lease payment of $48.
This lease runs through 2012, and provides for periodic increases in the annual
lease payment every five years equal to the cumulative change in the Consumer
Price Index. Additionally, Southern Alloy entered into a lease for certain
equipment from a related party on a month to month basis for $4 per month.
Southern Alloy believes these lease arrangements are no less favorable than
could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties.
During July 1997, subsequent to the merger, $2,115 of Southern Alloy debt
was repaid with advances from Metals USA.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Uni-Steel, Inc. Uni-Steel is a structural steel service center with
three locations in Oklahoma. Uni-Steel products include carbon structural,
pressure vessel, high strength low alloy and alloy grades of steel sold to
customers in Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and
Kansas. Value added processing services include cut-to-length, leveling, flame
cutting, plasma cutting, shearing, and sawing and press brake forming. Uni-Steel
services customers in a wide variety of industries including oil and gas, truck
trailer, construction equipment, mining machinery, elevators, wholesale trade
and the construction industries.
Uni-Steel and its shareholders entered into a merger agreement with Metals
USA, Inc. Metals USA pursuant to which all of Uni-Steel outstanding
shares of capital stock were exchanged for cash and shares of Metals USA common
stock concurrent with the consummation of the initial public offering the
Offering of Metals USA common stock See Note 11.
The financial statements for the period from October 1, 1996 through, July
10, 1997 are presented for purposes of complying with certain reporting
requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission and are
not neccessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market instruments with
original maturities of three months or less.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is primarily
determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment, including capitalized interest, is stated at cost,
net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed utilizing the
straight-line method at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the
various classes of assets.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of cash equivalents approximate their fair value. The
carrying amount of notes receivable approximate fair value at the applicable
balance sheet dates. The fair value of such notes receivable was based on
expected cash flows discounted using current rates at which similar loans would
be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. The fair value of the
long-term debt is estimated based on interest rates for the same or similar debt
offered to Uni-Steel having the same or similar remaining maturities and
collateral requirements. The carrying amounts of long-term debt approximate fair
value at the applicable balance sheet dates.

UNI-STEEL, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT SHARE AMOUNTS
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments, which potentially subject Uni-Steel to
concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash deposits, trade
accounts and note receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to
trade accounts receivable are within the southwest region of the United States.
Credit is extended once appropriate credit history and references have been
obtained. Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made
periodically as circumstances warrant based upon the expected collectibility
of all such accounts. Uni-Steel periodically reviews the credit history of its
customers and generally does not require collateral for the extension of credit.
INCOME TAXES
Uni-Steel accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES SFAS
109. Under SFAS 109, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on
enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the period in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. The principal items resulting
in the differences are different depreciation methods, use of the allowance
method for bad debts, and different inventory capitalization methods. Valuation
allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred assets to the
amount to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the year and
the change during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF SFAS 121 in March 1995. SFAS
121 requires that long-lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used
by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Uni-Steel adopted SFAS No. 121 on January 1, 1996. The impact of
adopting this standard did not have a material impact on the results of
operations.
2. NOTE RECEIVABLE
Uni-Steel has a note receivable with a balance of $1,208 at September 30,
1996. The note bears interest at 8% and is due in monthly installments of
principal and interest totaling $9 with a balloon payment of the remaining
balance due in September 2002. This note is secured by a mortgage on real estate
in Fountain, Colorado.

Net realizable value approximates cost on the first-in, first-out method.
In 1996, LIFO cost exceeded market value by $54. This 1996 amount was recorded
as a reduction of inventory and an increase in cost of sales. Management has
determined that lower of LIFO cost or market is the valuation method that most
accurately reflects the results of operations in accordance with generally
acceptable accounting principles. If the lower of FIFO cost or market had been
used for all inventories, their carrying value would have been equal to the LIFO
value of $9,947 at September 30, 1996 and $11,242 at July 10, 1997.
Additionally, net income would have been the same at $1,228 and $1,018 for the
year ended September 30, 1996 and for the period from October 1, 1996 through
July 10, 1997, respectively.
5. LINE OF CREDIT
At September 30, 1996, Uni-Steel had drawn $7,100 against its $7,500 line
of credit at a bank. Interest is computed at prime 825% at September 30,
1996. Payments of interest were due monthly and the principal balance was due
February 28, 1997. This line of credit was amended in February 1997 to increase
the maximum borrowings under the facility to $10,000 and extend the maturity
date to April 30, 1999. Interest is computed at prime or Uni-Steel may elect for
interest to be computed at LIBOR plus 25%. This election must be made in
borrowing increments of $1,000 and no more than two such LIBOR advances may be
outstanding at one time. As of July 10, 1997, Uni-Steel had drawn $8,000 against
its $10,000 line of credit.
Concurrently with the renewal of the line of credit, Uni-Steel also
obtained a $1,000 working capital term loan from its principal bank. Payments of
principal and interest are payable in equal monthly installments with final
maturity on February 28, 2002. Interest is also computed at Uni-Steel option
at prime or LIBOR plus 25%. The line of credit and working capital term loan
include certain covenants which, among other things, restrict future borrowings
and set certain ratio, cash flow and net worth

are secured by a primary security interest in the inventory and accounts
receivable of Uni-Steel.
