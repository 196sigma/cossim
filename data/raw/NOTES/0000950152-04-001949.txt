Statement of Management Responsibility for Financial
Reporting
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Tollgrade
Communications, Inc. and Subsidiaries have been prepared by management, who are
responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and include
amounts based on management best estimates and judgments. Financial
information elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the
financial statements.
Management has established and maintains a system of internal controls
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that
the financial records reflect the authorized transactions of the Company. The
system of internal controls includes widely communicated statements of policies
and business practices that are designed to require all employees to maintain
high ethical standards in the conduct of Company affairs. The internal controls
are augmented by organizational arrangements that provide for appropriate
delegation of authority and division of responsibility.
The financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, Independent Auditors. As part of their audit of the Company 2003
financial statements, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP considered the Company
statement of internal controls to the extent they deemed necessary to determine
the nature, timing and extent of their audit tests. The Report of Independent
Auditors follows.
The Board of Directors pursues its responsibility for the Company
financial reporting through its Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of
outside directors. The Audit Committee has met periodically with the Independent
Auditors and management. The Independent Auditors had direct access to the Audit
Committee, with and without the presence of management representatives, to
discuss the results of their audit work and their comments on the adequacy of
internal accounting controls and the quality of financial reporting.

-27             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tollgrade Communications, Inc. and
Subsidiaries     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity
and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Tollgrade Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for long-lived impairments, goodwill
and other intangible assets in 2002.

-32 TOLLGRADE COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Tollgrade Communications, Inc. the Company designs, engineers, markets and
supports test system, test access and status monitoring products and test
software for the telecommunications and cable television industries. The
Company telecommunications proprietary test access products enable telephone
companies to use their existing line test systems to remotely diagnose problems
in Plain Old Telephone Service POTS lines containing both copper and fiber
optics. The Company test system products, specifically the DigiTest test
platform, focus on helping local exchange carriers conduct the full range of
fault diagnosis along with the ability to prequalify, deploy and maintain

network communications; and transponders that are strategically located within
the cable network to gather status reports from power supplies, line amplifiers
and fiber-optic nodes. The Company was organized in 1986 and began operations in
1988.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Substantially all of the
Company cash and cash equivalents are maintained at one financial institution.
No collateral or security is provided on these deposits, other than $100,000 of
deposits per financial institution which is insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.
INVESTMENTS
Short-term investments at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 consisted of
individual municipal bonds stated at cost, which approximated market value.
These securities have maturities of one year or less at date of purchase and/or
contain a callable provision in which the bonds can be called within one year
from date of purchase. The primary investment purpose is to provide a reserve
for future business purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.
Realized gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method.
The Company classifies its investment in all debt securities as held
to maturity as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the
securities to maturity.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on
the first-in, first-out method. The Company provides appropriate reserves for
any inventory deemed slow moving or obsolete.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the related lease period or the estimated useful life, whichever is
shorter.
The cost of renewals and betterments that extend the lives or
productive capacities of properties is capitalized. Expenditures for normal
repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. The cost of
property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of and the related
accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any
resulting gain or loss is reflected in current operations.
RECEIVABLE FROM OFFICER
The Company extended a loan for $210,000 under a promissory note to an officer
of the Company in July 2001. The note provides for interest at 5% per annum with
repayment under various conditions but no later than May 20, 2008. The loan was
originally secured by collateral which currently has no value. The balance of
the loan at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $160,940 and $162,000, respectively.
The principal and interest were current at December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002.
-33 PRODUCT WARRANTY
The Company records estimated warranty costs on the accrual basis of accounting.
These reserves are based on applying historical returns to the current level of
product shipments and the cost experience associated therewith. In the case of
software, the reserves are based on the expected cost of providing services
within the agreed-upon warranty period. Activity in the warranty accrual is as
follows                            2002      2003
Balance at the beginning of the year       $ 2,068,000  $ 1,981,000
Accruals for warranties issued during the year    645,920    872,000
Accruals related to pre-existing warranties     106,029   182,000
Cheetah opening accrual - See Note 2               225,000
Settlements during the year             626,891   746,000
Balance at the end of the year          $ 1,981,000  $ 2,150,000
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment FOB shipping
terms when risk of loss, ownership and title have transferred to the customer,
which coincides with shipment of related products, and collection is reasonably
assured. Software license revenue is recognized in accordance with the Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables. The Company also follows Staff Accounting Bulletin
SAB 104, Revenue Recognition issued by the staff of the Securities
Exchange Commission which provides guidance related to revenue recognition.
Revenue from software license, which is comprised of fees for perpetual licenses
derived from contracts with corporate customers, is recognized when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, the product is delivered, written acceptance
is received from the customer which states that no significant Company
obligations remain, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
probable. In cases for orders of custom software, or orders that require
significant software customization, the Company will employ contract accounting
using the percentage-of-completion method whereby revenue is recognized based on
costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. Revenue from
Services testability consulting is recognized upon services being rendered.
Reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs is recognized as revenue and
simultaneously recognized as the cost of product sales. Revenue from Services
also includes revenue from maintenance agreements. Maintenance revenue is
generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related
agreement, which is typically one year. Customer advances and amounts due from
customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred income.
Revenue for license and royalty fees is recognized when earned.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are reviewed at least
annually. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of discounted
or undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets
and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and
use is based on the fair value of the assets. No impairments have been recorded
to date.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development costs to develop or improve hardware-related products
are charged to operations as incurred.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Any costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of software to be
sold or otherwise marketed are expensed as research and development costs. Costs
incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, and prior
to the general availability of the product to the public are capitalized and
subsequently amortized under the straight-line method. The Company defines
technological feasibility as coding and testing in accordance with detailed
program designs. Internally generated software development costs that have been
capitalized were $115,383 in 2003, $68,100 in 2002 and none in 2001. Such costs
are being amortized over five years.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined
based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation
allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount expected to be realized.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information, Financial Reporting for Segments of a
Business. This statement establishes standards for reporting information about
operating segments, products and services, geographic areas and major customers
in annual and interim financial statements. The Company manages and operates its
business as one segment. International sales were 58% of revenues in 2003, 63%
in 2002 and 53% in 2001.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended
by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities, and SFAS No, 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging. This statement establishes standards for reporting
information about various derivative financial instruments and accounting for
their change in fair value. The Company does not hold or issue derivative
instruments for hedging purposes and, therefore, this standard does not have a
material effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations
of the Company.
-34 RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform with
the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported
net income.
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has two stock-based employee compensation plans which are described
more fully in Note 5. The Company accounts for these plans under the recognition
and measurement provisions of Accounting Research Bulletin APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under these provisions,
stock-based employee compensation cost is not reflected in net income for any
year, as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the
market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. If the Company
had elected to recognize compensation cost for these stock options based on the
fair value method set forth in SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, net income and earnings per share would have reflected the pro
forma amounts indicated in the following table                           YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31
2001       2002       2003

2. ACQUISITIONS
On September 30, 2001, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of the LoopCareTM product line from Lucent Technologies, Inc. for
approximately $62,029,000 in cash, which includes approximately $2,200,000 of
acquisition-related costs. The assets consisted principally of rights to
existing contracts, software and related computer equipment, while the
liabilities were principally related to software warranties currently under
contract and deferred income. The Company used available cash and short-term
investments to finance the acquisition. The LoopCare acquisition was recorded
under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of
operations of the LoopCare business since October 1, 2001 have been included in
the consolidated financial statements.
On February 13, 2003, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed
certain liabilities of the CheetahTM status and performance monitoring product
line Cheetah from Acterna, LLC Acterna for approximately $14,300,000 in
cash. In addition, acquisition-related costs of approximately $599,000 were
capitalized for a total cost of approximately $14,899,000. The transaction
provided for an earnout to be paid in the first half of 2004 of up to $2,400,000
based on certain 2003 performance targets. The current calculation indicates
that amounts due under this provision are immaterial. The acquired assets
consist principally of existing sales order backlog, product inventory,
intellectual property, software and related computer equipment, while the
assumed liabilities principally relate to deferred software maintenance,
warranty and other obligations. The $14,300,000 due at closing and related
acquisition expenses were paid from available cash and short-term investments.
The Company believes that the acquired product line complements its current
cable operations and positions the Company as a leading supplier of testing
equipment and software for the cable industry. The acquisition was recorded
under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, and accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired
product line from February 14, 2003 forward are included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company.
The Company has made an allocation of the Cheetah purchase price to the
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price
remains subject to change pending agreement between the parties regarding the
earn-out provision and post closing purchase price adjustments. Any changes to
the purchase price are expected to be accounted for as adjustments to goodwill
and may be material.

NET ASSETS ACQUIRED OF CHEETAH            $ 14,899,000
An independent valuation consultant assisted management in its initial
determination of fair value assigned to certain intangible assets other than
goodwill. Discounted future cash flow models were utilized where appropriate.
The Cheetah product line has maintained a significant market share in
cable status and performance monitoring equipment for more than 25 years and has
a large installed customer base, including many of the largest multiple system
cable operators. The Company has assumed that, on average, approximately 85% of
future revenues attributable to Cheetah products will be derived from this
customer base and, based on prior experience, does not anticipate turnover or
loss of these customers. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the customer
base and Cheetah trademark intangible assets have an indefinite life.
Consequently, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, the values assigned to customer base and the Cheetah trademark, as well
as to related goodwill, are not being amortized for financial reporting
purposes.
The Company intends that the base software will be used in future
releases of CheetahNetTM formerly NetMentorTM and other software products
with little change into the foreseeable future. Similarly, the proprietary
technology embedded in transponder hardware is designed to have a relatively
long useful life. Therefore, the Company has determined that the base software
and proprietary software have a remaining useful life of ten years and are being
amortized for financial reporting purposes over that period.
The Company obtained a backlog of customer purchase orders totaling
approximately $2,160,000 in connection with the Cheetah acquisition. Using a
discounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined an acquired value of
$543,000 for this backlog. This asset, which is included in prepaid expenses and
other current assets, is being amortized as the related orders are being
realized as sales revenue. Amortization of approximately $540,000 was recognized
in cost of sales from the date of the acquisition through December 31, 2003.
For tax purposes, the Company is amortizing all intangible assets over
15 years. Goodwill deducted for tax purposes amounted to $269,000 in 2001 1,077,000 in 2002 and $1,265,000 in 2003.
SFAS No. 142 provides that entities evaluate the remaining useful lives
of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives periodically to
determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite
useful life and that such assets be tested at least annually for impairment of
value. The Company policy is to test all intangible assets for impairment in
value as of December 31 of each year or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.
The Company had net intangible assets, including goodwill, of
$71,556,000 at December 31, 2003, of which $58,620,000 resulted from the
LoopCare acquisition and $12,936,000 resulted from the Cheetah acquisition. The
Company has determined that it has only one operating unit and has completed a
test for goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2003 by comparing the aggregate
market value of the Company stock with the Company book carrying value,
including goodwill. This test indicated that there was no impairment of the
goodwill carrying value.
All other intangible assets were tested for impairment of carrying
value as of December 31, 2003 using assumptions and techniques employed in the
original valuations and following the guidance of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Specifically, the sum of the
projected future cash flows to be derived from assets with definite lives was
compared with the net book carrying value. The impairment test for
non-amortizable intangible assets other than goodwill consisted of a comparison
of the estimated fair value with carrying amounts. The values of the LoopCare
trade name and Cheetah trademark were measured using the relief-from-royalty
method and discounted cash flow analyses were employed to test the value of the
LoopCare base software and post warranty maintenance service agreements and the
value of the Cheetah customer base. These tests indicated that none of the
intangible assets had impairment in carrying value. The Company will retest
these assets annually as of December 31 or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.

-  SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS
In order to protect shareholder value in the event of an unsolicited offer to
acquire the Company, on July 23, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company
declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding
share of the Company common stock. The dividend was payable on August 15, 1996
to shareholders of record as of that date. The aforementioned rights are
exercisable only if a person or group acquires or announces an offer to acquire
20% or more of the Company common stock. In such an event, each right will
entitle shareholders to buy one-hundredth of a share of a new series of
preferred stock at an exercise price of $11500. Each one-hundredth of a share
of the new preferred stock has terms designed to make it the economic and voting
equivalent of one share of common stock.
If a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company outstanding
common stock, each right not owned by the person or group will entitle its
holder to purchase at the right exercise price a number of shares of the
Company common stock or, at the option of the Company, the new preferred
stock having a market value of twice the exercise price. Further, at any time
after a person or group acquires 20% or more but less than 50% of the
outstanding common stock, the Board of Directors may at its option, exchange
part or all of the rights other than rights held by the acquiring person or
group for shares of the Company common or preferred stock on a one-for-one
basis. Each right further provides that if the Company is acquired in a merger
or other business transaction, each right will entitle its holder to purchase,
at the right exercise price, a number of the acquiring company common shares
having a market value at that time of twice the exercise price.
The Board of Directors is entitled to redeem the rights for one cent
per right at any time before a 20% position has been acquired. The Board of
Directors is also authorized to reduce the 20% thresholds referred to above to
not less than 10%.
6. LICENSE AND ROYALTY FEES
The Company has entered into several technology license agreements with certain
major Digital Loop Carrier DLC vendors and major Operation Support System
OSS equipment manufacturers under which the Company has been granted access to
the licensor patent technology and the right to manufacture and sell the
patent technology in the Company product line. The Company is obligated to pay
royalty fees, as defined, through the terms of these license agreements. Under
these agreements, license and royalty fees are due only upon purchase of the
technology or shipment of units; there are no contingent payment provisions in
any of these arrangements. Royalty fees of $1,832,981, $889,024 and $966,715
were incurred in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, and are included in cost of
product sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

LIGHTHOUSE and the newly acquired CheetahNet lines, contributed approximately
27% while DigiTest and LoopCare RTU sales accounted for approximately 10% and
5%, respectively, of the Company net sales for 2003. Revenue from Services,
which includes installation oversight and project management services provided
to RBOCs and fees for LoopCare and Cheetah software maintenance, accounted for
approximately 19% of the Company net sales for 2003.
Sales to RBOC customers accounted for approximately 71%, 77% and 56% of
the Company net product sales for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003,
respectively. During 2001, 2002 and 2003, sales to three RBOC customers
individually exceeded 10% of consolidated revenues and, on a combined basis,
comprised 66% individually, 38%, 14% and 14%, 70% individually, 38%, 18% and
14% and 48% individually, 17%, 17% and 14% of the Company net product
sales, respectively. Sales to a large independent carrier accounted for
approximately 11% of the Company net product sales for fiscal year 2001 and
was less than 10% in 2002 and 2003. Due to the Company present dependency on
RBOC customers, the loss of one or more of the RBOCs as a customer, or the
reduction of orders for the Company products by the RBOCs, could materially
and adversely affect the Company.
The Company utilizes three key independent subcontractors to perform a
majority of the circuit board assembly and in-circuit testing work on its
products. The Company also utilizes other subassembly contractors on a more
limited basis. The loss of the subcontractors could cause delays in the
Company ability to meet production obligations and could have a material
adverse effect on the Company results of operations. In addition, shortages of
raw material or production capacity constraints at the Company subcontractors
could negatively affect the Company ability to meet its production obligations
and result in increased prices for affected parts. Any such reduction may result
in delays in shipments of the Company products or increases in the price of
components, either of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company.
11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401k benefit plan. Eligible employees, as defined in the
plan, may contribute up to 20% of eligible compensation, not to exceed the
statutory limit. The Company does not make matching contributions to the plan.
12. SEVERANCE AND RELATED EXPENSE
On September 30, 2002, the Company announced its second restructuring program in
two years to implement certain cost reduction initiatives which included the
elimination of 47 positions, primarily in research and development. The
restructuring program resulted in a pre-tax charge for severance, outplacement
and other related costs of $175,723 in 2002. The initial restructuring program
in April 2001 resulted in a pre-tax charge of $291,000 in 2001 and eliminated
approximately 80 positions. All amounts for 2001 and 2002 have been paid.
13. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
On August 15, 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligation. On October 4, 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company
adopted these statements on January 1, 2003 and such adoption did not have a
material effect on the Company results of operations or financial position.
In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal. SFAS No. 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Forces Issue No. 94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs
to Exit an Activity Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. The
new statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when
the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal
activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption did not have
a material effect on the Company results of operations or financial position.
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN 45. FIN 45 requires that upon
issuance of a guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair
value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee. FIN 45 also requires
additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued. The
recognition provisions of FIN 45 were effective for any guarantees that are
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The provisions of FIN 45 did not
have a material impact on the Company results of operations or financial
position.
The Company early adopted EITF Issue 00-21, Accounting for Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which applies to all deliverables
within contractually binding arrangements that include multiple
revenue-generating activities. This Issue was finalized in May 2003 and did not
have a material impact on the Company results of operations or financial
condition.
On December 17, 2003, the Staff of the SEC issued SAB 104, Revenue
Recognition, which supercedes SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. SAB 104 was issued to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB
101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, which was superceded as a
result of the issuance of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables. This bulletin did not impact our results of operations
or financial condition.

Net income per share has been computed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 128, Earnings Per Share for all periods presented. On February 10, 2000,
the Company Board of Directors authorized a two-for-one stock split of the
Company common stock, payable in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. On
March 20, 2000, shareholders of record received one additional share of common
stock for each share of common stock held of record on February 28, 2000. All
share and per share information reflects the two-for-one split of the Company
common stock. SFAS No. 128 requires companies with complex capital structures to
report earnings per share on a basic and diluted basis, as defined. Basic
earnings per share are calculated on the actual number of weighted average
common shares outstanding for the period, while diluted earnings per share must
include the effect of any dilutive securities. All prior periods have been
restated in accordance with SFAS No. 128.
A reconciliation of earnings per share is as follows                                    December 31, 2001  December 31, 2002  DECEMBER 31, 2003

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
As of December 31, 2003, the Company has carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision of, and with the participation of, the Company
management, including the Company chief executive officer and principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the

or submits under Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.
There were no changes during the Company fourth fiscal quarter of
2003 in the Company internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company
internal control over financial reporting.
