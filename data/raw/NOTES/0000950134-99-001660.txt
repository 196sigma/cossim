REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Stockholders of StaffMark, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of StaffMark,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company, a Delaware corporation as of December
31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of StaffMark, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                         ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Little Rock, Arkansas,

STAFFMARK, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS   StaffMark, Inc. StaffMark or the Company is a global provider of
diversified staffing, solutions, professional and consulting services to
businesses, professional and service organizations and governmental agencies.
As of December 31, 1998, StaffMark operated offices in 31 states and 12
countries. StaffMark provides services to numerous customers, none of which
individually represent a significant portion of revenues within a geographic
region or for the Company as a whole.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers cash on deposit with financial institutions and all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to
be cash equivalents.
Property and Equipment   Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated or
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which are as follows                               
Furniture, fixtures and equipment            5-7 years
Computer equipment and software             5-7 years
Leasehold improvements                 3-15 years   Additions that extend the lives of the assets are capitalized while repairs
and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. When property and equipment are
retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are
removed from the balance sheet and any resultant gain or loss is recorded.
Intangible Assets   Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, which is generally
amortized over 30 years using the straight-line method. Deferred financing
costs are amortized over the life of the respective debt obligation using a
method which approximates the effective interest method. Intangibles associated
with non-compete agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over
the life of the respective agreements.
Workers' Compensation   StaffMark self-insures certain risks related to workers' compensation
claims. The estimated costs of existing and future claims are accrued as
incidents occur based upon historical loss development trends and may be
subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. StaffMark
has engaged the services of a third-party actuary to assist with the
development of these cost estimates.
Revenue Recognition   Service revenues are recognized as income at the time staffing services are
provided.                    29
30
Income Taxes   Income taxes have been provided based upon the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires recognition of deferred income taxes using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes result from the effect of transactions which are
recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting purposes.
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of such temporary
differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates to differences between the
financial reporting and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities.
Prior to the acquisitions in October 1996, as discussed in Note 3, Brewer
Personnel Services, Inc. Brewer was an S Corporation for income tax
reporting purposes. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes
related to the income for those periods is reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements since such taxes are liabilities of the
individual stockholders. The S Corporation status of Brewer terminated upon the
effective date of these acquisitions.
Foreign Currency Translation   The functional currency for certain of the Company foreign subsidiaries
is the local currency. The translation from the foreign currency to U.S.
dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using the exchange rate in
effect at the balance sheet date and for income statement accounts using a
weighted-average exchange rate during the period. The gains or losses resulting
from such translations are included in the accompanying consolidated statements
of stockholders' equity.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments   StaffMark financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and its
debt obligations. Management believes that these financial instruments bear
interest at rates which approximate prevailing market rates for instruments
with similar characteristics and, accordingly, that the carrying values for
these instruments are reasonable estimates of fair value.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   StaffMark regularly evaluates whether events and circumstances have
occurred which may indicate that the carrying amount of intangible or other
long-lived assets warrant revision or may not be recoverable. When factors
indicate that an asset or assets should be evaluated for possible impairment,
an evaluation is performed pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed of. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset
carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market value or discounted cash
flow value is required. During 1998 the Company recognized an impairment in the
goodwill associated with its physical/occupational therapy business unit as
more fully described in Note 4.
Stock Options   During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which encourages all
companies to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value, at grant
date, of instruments issued pursuant to stock-based compensation plans. SFAS
No. 123 requires the fair value of the instruments granted, which is measured
pursuant to the provisions of the statement, to be recognized as compensation
expense over the vesting period of the instrument. However, the statement also
allows companies to continue to measure compensation costs for these
instruments using the method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25 APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Companies electing to account for stock-based compensation plans
pursuant to the provisions of APB No. 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net
income as if the fair value method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied.
StaffMark has elected to account for stock options under the provisions of APB
No. 25 and has included the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123 in Note 12.
Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The
estimates and assumptions used in preparing the accompanying consolidated
financial statements are based upon management evaluation of the relevant
facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements. However,
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing
these consolidated financial statements.                    30
31
Other Comprehensive Income   As required, the Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income, in its financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 1998, and has conformed its prior year financial statements
accordingly. Other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency
translation gains and losses and has been included in the accompanying
consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and for Hedging Activities. This Statement establishes accounting
and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded
on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value.
SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in a derivative fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative gains and losses
to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and
requires that a company must formally document, designate and assess the
effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. SFAS No. 133 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999, and cannot be applied
retroactively. StaffMark has not yet quantified the impacts of adopting SFAS
No. 133 on its financial statements; however, SFAS No. 133 could increase the
volatility of reported earnings and other comprehensive income once adopted.
Classification of Prior Year Balances   Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances in order to
conform with the current year presentation.
3.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS   StaffMark was founded in March 1996, and in October 1996 the Company
acquired six local and regional temporary staffing companies the Founding
Companies and completed an initial public offering of its common stock the
Offering. Based on the provisions of the Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 97, Brewer was designated as
the acquirer, for financial reporting purposes, of the other five staffing
companies the Other Founding Companies. Cash of approximately $130 million
and 3,683,249 shares of common stock were issued in conjunction with the
mergers of the Founding Companies. Based on the applicable provisions of SAB
No. 97, the acquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities of the Other
Founding Companies have been reflected at their historical cost and their
results of operations and cash flows have been included only from the date of
acquisition.
The operating results of all acquisitions accounted for under the purchase
method have been included since the effective date of acquisition. The costs of
these acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair market values of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess costs over fair
values of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been restated for significant
pooling-of-interests business combinations. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.
Since the date of the initial public offering, the Company has completed
the following business combinations                Purchase Business Combinations          Pooling-of-Interests

32   In addition to the purchase prices disclosed above, certain of these
acquisition agreements include provisions for the payment of additional
consideration, which is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance
measures of the businesses acquired. During 1998, the Company paid
consideration totaling $369 million in cash and 169,434 shares of common stock
pursuant to these arrangements. Additionally, as of December 31, 1998 and 1997,
the Company had accrued approximately $316 million and $96 million,
respectively, related to certain contingent consideration arrangements. These
amounts have been reported as other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. Management believes that any additional
consideration to be paid related to acquisitions completed prior to December
31, 1998 will not be significant.
On November 25, 1998, StaffMark completed its merger with Robert Walters
plc Robert Walters. In connection with the merger, each outstanding share
of Robert Walters common stock was converted into the right to receive 0272
shares of the Company common stock, totaling 6,687,704 common shares in the
aggregate. The merger has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
restated to include the accounts of Robert Walters for all periods presented.

1997 are shown below. For purposes of this presentation, significant
acquisitions represent those which have purchase prices greater than 10% of the
Company total assets at the end of the year preceding the acquisition. Note
that the pro forma information presented below reflects reductions in salaries
that certain owners agreed to in conjunction with these significant acquisitions
totaling approximately $03 million and $33 million in 1998 and 1997,
respectively, and excludes $273 million in nonrecurring charges primarily
related to the Robert Walters merger and other pooling-of-interests
transactions.                              Fiscal Years

4.  NON-RECURRING MERGER AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES AND PROVISIONS TO REDUCE
THE CARRYING VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS   During 1998, the Company recorded merger and integration expenses and
provisions to reduce the carrying value of certain assets totaling $273
million. The merger and integration expenses recorded totaled approximately
$246 million and relate to the merger with Robert Walters and other
pooling-of-interests transactions completed during 1998. Included in these
costs are approximately $133 million for professional and financial advisors'
fees, approximately $108 million related to integration expenses and
approximately $500,000 for severance and employee-related expenses. Integration
expenses consist primarily of costs related to office closings and contract
terminations pursuant to management plan of integration, which is expected to
be completed by September 1999. Substantially all costs associated with
severance had been incurred as of December 31, 1998.
The following is a summary of the Company merger and integration accrual                              in thousands

The Company also recorded a non-cash, charge of $14 million to write down
the carrying value of goodwill due to its plan to discontinue or dispose of its
physical/occupational therapy business. In conjunction with negotiating a new
credit facility, the Company also recorded a non-cash charge of $13 million to
write-off deferred financing costs related to its previously outstanding debt.
5.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE   Included in accounts receivable are unbilled amounts totaling approximately
$187 million and $92 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

8.  DEBT   The Company has a credit facility the Credit Facility with a consortium
of banks used for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
including acquisitions. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, maximum borrowings
pursuant to the Credit Facility were limited to approximately $250 million and
$100 million, respectively. As of December 31, 1997, the Credit Facility was
comprised of a $30 million revolving credit facility and a $70 million
acquisition facility. As of December 31, 1998 no distinction is made between
the revolving credit facility and the acquisition facility. The Credit Facility
matures on August 20, 2003 and interest on any borrowings is computed using the
Company option of either LIBOR or Mercantile Bank, N.A. prime rate which is
incrementally adjusted based on the Company operating leverage ratios. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company is required to pay quarterly commitment fees
equal to 020%-025% of the unused portion of the total revolving credit
commitment.
The Credit Facility requires compliance with certain financial ratios and
other operational covenants. The Company was in compliance with all covenants
at December 31, 1998. The Credit Facility is secured by a pledge of 100% of the
stock of all of the Company domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of all
of the Company foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, debt
outstanding under the Credit Facility consisted of the following                                              1998      1997   
Borrowings on revolving credit facility. Interest payable monthly at a
variable rate which averaged 659% and 850% during the years ended
December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Matures on August 20, 2003.                $176,700,000  $ 3,000,000
Borrowings on acquisition facility. Interest payable quarterly
at a variable rate which averaged 699% during the year
ended December 31, 1997.                            --      9,000,000
$176,700,000  $ 12,000,000
The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements during 1998. Under
the terms of these agreements, the Company is obligated to pay interest on a
notional amount to the extent that the fixed rate under the interest rate swap
agreements exceed the LIBOR rate, as measured pursuant to the agreements.
Furthermore, the Company will receive interest to the extent that the LIBOR
rate exceeds the aforementioned fixed rate. Interest received as a result of
these agreements has been netted against interest expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. The amounts related to the interest rate
swap agreements as of and for the year ended December 31, 1998 were as follows   Notional    Fixed    LIBOR    Interest    Estimated
Amount    Rate     Rate    Revenue    Fair Value    Maturity  
$20,000,000   4865%    5281%     --      $112,709    October 2001
$20,000,000   4823%    5209%   $14,180     $145,141    October 2001
$20,000,000   4835%    5377%   $15,654     $ 86,776    November 2000                    34
35
The Company involvement with derivative financial instruments is limited
to the interest rate swap agreements discussed above. The Company entered into
these agreements as hedges against increases in interest rates which would
increase the cost of its variable rate borrowings under the Credit Facility.
Conversely, the Company is exposed to the risk that the cost of those
borrowings would be higher than the amount computed under the Credit Facility
should interest rates decline. In addition, the Company is exposed to credit
risk in the event of non-performance by the bank facilitating these agreements
but has no off-balance-sheet risk of accounting loss related to these
agreements.

A valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets has not been recorded in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because management believes that
all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recovered. In assessing
the realizability of deferred income tax assets, management has considered
scheduled reversals of the deferred income tax liabilities and projected future
taxable income.
The differences in income taxes determined by applying the statutory
federal tax rate of 35% for 1998, 1997 and 1996, to income before income taxes

10.  WORKERS' COMPENSATION   StaffMark is self-insured for certain workers' compensation claims and is
regulated by various state-administered workers' compensation insurance
commissions. StaffMark has purchased insurance for claims which exceed certain
thresholds and is required in certain states to maintain letters of credit to
cover any potential unpaid claims. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, these letters
of credit totaled approximately $52 million and $27 million, respectively.
11.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS   The Company maintains several defined contribution employee benefit plans,
some of which allow eligible employees to defer a portion of their income
through contributions to the plans. Contributions by StaffMark to the various
plans were approximately $12 million, $03 million and $01 million for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
In May 1997, the Company shareholders approved an employee stock purchase
plan the Stock Purchase Plan which grants employees the right to purchase
common shares of the Company stock at a price equal to the lower of 85% of
the market value on the date of purchase or the beginning of the calendar
quarter of the purchase. Purchases under the Stock Purchase Plan are limited to
10% of the respective employees' compensation and do not impact the Company
reported net income.
12.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS Common Stock   The Company shareholders had authorized 200,000,000 and 26,000,000 shares
of common stock for issuance as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Common shares outstanding as of December 31, 1997 include 7,895,699 shares
which represent the equivalent common shares issued for pooling-of-interests
business combinations that were completed during 1998. Additionally, the
Company shareholders had authorized 10,000,000 and 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock for issuance as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
In conjunction with the organization and initial capitalization, StaffMark
issued 1,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $01 per share. In June
1996, StaffMark Board of Directors declared a 1,355-for-one stock split. The
effect of this stock split has been reflected as a reduction of paid-in-capital
and an increase in common stock in the accompanying consolidated statements of
stockholders' equity.
StaffMark issued 5,618,249 shares of common stock to the stockholders of
the Founding Companies and issued 6,325,000 shares of common stock to the
public in conjunction with the Offering. Additionally, the accompanying
consolidated statements                    36
37
of stockholders' equity have been restated to present the issuance of 3,867,840
equivalent shares of StaffMark common stock to reflect Robert Walters' initial
public offering during 1996 and 2,313,944 shares to reflect the conversion of
Robert Walters' equivalent Brewer shares into shares of StaffMark common stock.
On August 26, 1997, the Company completed a common stock offering which
involved the public sale of 3,950,000 shares including underwriters'
over-allotment of common stock. Approximately 285,000 of these shares were
sold by certain stockholders of the Company the Selling Stockholders. The
Company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of these shares by
the Selling Stockholders. Additionally, Robert Walters issued 348,160
equivalent StaffMark shares in conjunction with a public sale of common stock
during 1997.
Dividends   During the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, Robert Walters
made distributions to its shareholders prior to the merger totaling $693,880 1,552,274 and $1,563,080, respectively. Prior to its merger with StaffMark,
Brewer made 1996 cash and property distributions to its shareholders totaling
$1,015,092 and $73,700, respectively. StaffMark has not historically paid any
dividends on its common stock and intends to continue this practice for the
foreseeable future.
Stock Options   Prior to the Offering, Brewer granted stock options to certain key
employees. These options were granted at fair value as determined by
management, were exercisable in installments and expired from June 30, 1999 to
February 26, 2001. A summary of Brewer stock option activity, as restated for
the merger with Robert Walters, is as follows                                   Weighted

In June 1996, StaffMark Board of Directors and stockholders approved
StaffMark 1996 Stock Option Plan the Plan. The maximum number of shares
of StaffMark common stock that may be issued under the Plan is the greater of
1,500,000 shares or 12% of the total number of shares of common stock
outstanding. Options granted under the Plan generally become 40% vested after
two years and then vest 20% in each of the next three years. Under the Plan,
the exercise price of the option equals the market value of StaffMark common
stock on the date of the grant, and the maximum term for each option is 10
years.
Robert Walters maintained three stock option plans for its employees, all 
of which required compensatory accounting treatment under APB No. 25. Total
compensation income/expense recognized related to Robert Walters stock option
plans was $745,695, $4,629,864 and $307,623 for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. These amounts have been included in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements
of income and reflected as adjustments to paid-in capital in the accompanying
consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.                    37
38   Robert Walters options became fully vested on the effective date of the
merger and 116,180 equivalent StaffMark options had been exercised as of
December 31, 1998. A summary of StaffMark stock option activity is as

As discussed in Note 2, StaffMark has elected to account for its stock
options under the provisions of APB No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation expense
has been recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income other
than the compensation income/expense recognized related to Robert Walters
stock option plans for the periods prior to the merger discussed above. Pursuant
to the requirements of SFAS No. 123, the following disclosures are presented to
reflect StaffMark pro forma net income for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996, as if the fair value method of accounting prescribed by SFAS No.
123 had been used. In preparing the pro forma disclosures, StaffMark determined
the value of all options granted prior to the Offering date using the minimum
value method, as discussed in SFAS No. 123. For stock options granted from the
Offering date to December 31, 1998, the fair value was estimated on the grant
date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. These fair value calculations
were based on the following assumptions                                    Fiscal Years
1998     1997    1996  
Weighted average risk-free interest rate          455%     525%     630%
Dividend yield                        0%      0%      0%
Weighted average expected life              5 years    5 years   46 years

39   Using these assumptions, the fair value of the noncompensatory stock options
granted during the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was
approximately $120 million, $95 million and $60 million, respectively. The
weighted average fair value of noncompensatory options granted during 1998, 1997
and 1996 was $1460, $1097 and $704, respectively. Had compensation expense
been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, utilizing the assumptions above
and the straight-line amortization method over the vesting period, net income
would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts                                          Fiscal Years

13.   EARNINGS PER SHARE   In accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, basic earnings per
share is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average common
shares outstanding during each year. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur assuming exercise of all outstanding stock
options. In calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for 1996, the
Brewer shares and options outstanding prior to the Offering have been restated
to reflect an equivalent number of StaffMark shares and options, determined
using the total consideration paid for Brewer by StaffMark. A reconciliation of
net income and weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted
earnings per share is as follows                              1998       1997       1996
Basic earnings per share:
Net income applicable to common shares         $ 18,639,429   $ 20,399,798   $ 7,492,796
Weighted average common shares outstanding        28,592,694    24,009,220    11,588,375
Basic earnings per share of common stock        $    065   $    085   $    065
Diluted earnings per share:
Net income applicable to common shares         $ 18,639,429   $ 20,399,798   $ 7,492,796
Weighted average common shares outstanding        28,592,694    24,009,220    11,588,375

Diluted earnings per share of common stock    $    063   $    082   $    064
Options to purchase 316,850 shares of common stock at prices ranging from
$29125 to $40750 per share were outstanding during 1998 but were not included
in the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise prices were
greater than the average market price of the Company common shares. These
options, which expire ten years from the date of issue, were still outstanding
as of December 31, 1998.                    39

14.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS StaffMark has entered into agreements with certain officers and employees of
the Company to lease certain parcels of land and buildings used in the
Company operations. Rent expense related to these facilities totaled
approximately $608,536, $644,000 and $304,000 for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Annual future minimum payments required
under these leases are included in the table in Note 16 and are summarized as
follows       Fiscal Years                    Amount 
1999                    $  309,774
2000                       249,492
2001                       22,000
2002                                 2003                        --  
$  581,266
Included in other current assets as of December 31, 1998 and 1997 are

respectively. Also included in other current assets as of December 31, 1998 and
1997 is a note receivable from a stockholder totaling $1,000,000 which bears
interest at 65% and is payable in annual installments through maturity on
February 28, 2002.
15.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   StaffMark is subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal
course of business, primarily relating to workers' compensation and other
employee related matters. StaffMark maintains various insurance coverages in
order to minimize the financial risk associated with certain of these claims.
In the opinion of management, any uninsured losses resulting from the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not be material to StaffMark financial
position or results of operations.
StaffMark has employment agreements with certain executive officers and
management personnel that provide for annual salaries, cost-of-living
adjustments and additional compensation in the form of performance-based
bonuses. Certain agreements include covenants against competition with
StaffMark, which extend for a period of time after termination. These
agreements generally continue until terminated by the employee or StaffMark.
16.   NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES   StaffMark leases office space and certain equipment under noncancelable
operating leases. As discussed in Note 14, certain of these facilities are
leased from related parties. Annual future minimum payments required under
operating leases that have an initial or remaining noncancelable lease term in
excess of one year are as follows       Fiscal Years                    Amount 
1999                     $ 9,572,973

2003                      1,793,817
$26,715,962
Rent expense, including amounts paid to related parties, was approximately
$111 million, $49 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.                    40

17.   SEGMENT INFORMATION   In 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, which requires reporting segment
information consistent with the way management internally disaggregates an
entity operations to assess performance and to allocate resources. As
required, the Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 131 for the year
ended December 31, 1998 and has also presented below the required segment
information for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996.
StaffMark segments its operations based upon differences in services
provided and has established separate management teams responsible for each
operating segment. The Company Commercial Segment provides clerical and light
industrial staffing services in the United States. The Company
Professional/Information Technology Segment provides staffing, consulting,
technical and support services primarily in the areas of finance, accounting,
information technology and legal services in the United States, the United
Kingdom, Australia and eight other foreign countries. The corporate column
includes general corporate expenses, headquarters facilities and equipment,
internal-use software, and other non-recurring expenses not allocated to the
segments.
The accounting policies used in measuring segment assets and operating
results are the same as those described in Note 2. The Company evaluates
performance of the segments based on segment operating income, excluding
corporate overhead, nonrecurring and unusual items. The Company does not have
any significant intersegment sales or transfers.
The results of the Company business segments as of and for the years
ending December 31 are as follows                   Professional/
