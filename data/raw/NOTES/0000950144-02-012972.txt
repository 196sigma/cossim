INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
The Board of Directors
Central Parking Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Central
Parking Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of September30, 2002
and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September30, 2002. In connection with our audits of
the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial
statement ScheduleII Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and financial
statement ScheduleIV Mortgage Loans on Real Estate as of September30, 2002
and for each of the years in the three-year period ended September30, 2002.
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Central
Parking Corporation and subsidiaries as of September30, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September30, 2002, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the
preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is as
follows a Organization and Basis of Presentation
Central Parking Corporation CPC is a United States company
incorporated in the State of Tennessee. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Central Parking Corporation and its subsidiaries the
Company or Central Parking including Central Parking System, Inc. CPS
and its subsidiaries; Kinney System Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries
Kinney; Central Parking System of the United Kingdom, Ltd. and its
subsidiary CPS-UK; Central Parking System Realty, Inc. and its subsidiaries
Realty; Allright Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries Allright,
including Edison Parking Management, L.P. Edison, a 50% owned partnership
whereby Allright is the general partner and has effective control of the
partnership based on the terms of the partnership agreement. The results of
operations of the remaining 50% of Edison are eliminated as a minority
interest. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
The Company owns, operates and manages parking facilities and provides
parking consulting services throughout the world, primarily in the United
States and United Kingdom. The Company manages and operates owned or leased
parking facilities, manages and operates parking facilities owned or leased by
third parties, and provides financial and other advisory services to clients.
b Revenues
Parking revenues include the parking revenues from leased and owned
locations. Management contract revenues represent revenues both fixed and
performance-based fees from facilities managed for other parties and
miscellaneous fees for accounting, insurance and other ancillary services such
as consulting and transportation management services. Parking revenues from
transient parking are recognized as cash is received. Parking revenues from
monthly parking customers, fixed fee management contract revenues and
miscellaneous management fees are recognized on a monthly basis based on the
terms of the underlying contracts. Management contract revenues related to
performance-based arrangements are accrued when the performance measures have
been met.
Management accounts payable reflected on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets is reflected net of cash. Such cash balances belong to the
owners of the various managed facilities, but they are held by the Company and
are used to pay expenses of the managed facilities and ultimately to settle the
balance due to the owners of the managed facilities.
The Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No101, Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements SAB 101 during fiscal 2001 as a change in
accounting principle. Adoption of SAB 101 required the Company to change the
timing of recognition of performance-based revenues on certain management
contracts. The cumulative effect of this accounting change was a loss of $258
thousand, net of tax of $171 thousand, as of October1, 2000.
In January 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF released Issue
No01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred, which the Company adopted in the third
quarter of fiscal year 2002. This pronouncement requires the Company to
recognize as both revenues and expenses, in equal amounts, costs directly
reimbursed from its management clients. Previously, expenses directly
reimbursed under management agreements were netted against the reimbursement
received. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the new
presentation. Adoption of the pronouncement resulted in an increase in total
revenues and total costs and expenses in equal amounts of $3903million 3734million and $3127million for the years ended September30, 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. This accounting change has no impact on operating
earnings or net earnings.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash on hand,
in banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less.
Page 40 of 76 Table of Contents
d Property, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements
Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, including computer
hardware and software, are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided
principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the
asset, which is generally one to fifteen years for furniture, fixtures, and
equipment, three years for computer software, five years for computer hardware,
and thirty to forty years for buildings and garages. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the
asset, whichever is shorter. Major additions and improvements to property and
equipment that extend the economic life are capitalized. Repair and
maintenance costs are charged to operating expense as incurred.
e Investment in and Advances to Partnerships and Joint Ventures
The Company has a number of joint ventures to operate and develop parking
garages through either corporate joint ventures, general partnerships, limited
liability companies, or limited partnerships. The financial results of the
Companys joint ventures are generally accounted for under the equity method
and are included in equity in partnership and joint venture earnings in the
accompanying consolidated statements of earnings with the exception of Edison,
which is consolidated into the Companys financial statements based upon the
Companys control of Edison, with the remaining 50% eliminated through minority
interest.
Amounts due from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures under
notes receivable are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as
investments in and advances to partnerships and joint ventures until amounts
due become payable in the next twelve months. When these amounts become due
within the next twelve months, such amounts are presented as current portion of
notes receivable from related parties in the consolidated balance sheets.
f Investment in Edison Parking Management, L.P.
On June1, 1997, Allright acquired a 50% controlling interest in Edison.
Edisons assets include management contracts contributed by the limited
partner, Park Fast Parking Management, L.P. Park Fast, a third party. These
management contracts were recorded at their estimated fair market value and are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which
average 12years.
g Contract and Lease Rights
Contract and lease rights consist of capitalized payments made to third
parties which provide the Company the opportunity to manage or lease
facilities. Contract and lease rights are allocated among respective locations
and are amortized principally on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
related agreements, which range from five to thirty years or an estimated term
considering anticipated terminations and renewals.
h Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair
value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination,
is not amortized beginning in fiscal year 2002, but is tested for impairment at
least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that
goodwill may be impaired. i Other Assets
Other assets is comprised of a combination of the cash surrender value of
life insurance policies, investment securities, security deposits, key money,
deferred issuance costs on the mandatorily redeemable convertible securities,
deferred debt issuance costs and non-compete agreements. Investment securities
primarily consist of debt obligations of states and political subdivisions and
are classified as held-to-maturity. Such securities are stated at amortized
cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, unless
there is a decline in value which is considered to be other than temporary, in
which case the cost basis of such security is written down to fair value and
the amount of the write-down is reflected in earnings. Key money represents
lease prepayments tendered to lessors at the inception of long-term lease
relationships and is amortized over the life of the applicable lease.
Non-compete agreements are amortized over the contractual term of the agreement
or the economic useful life, whichever is shorter. Deferred issuance costs are
amortized over the contractual term of the related debt or redeemable
convertible securities. jLease Transactions and Related Balances
The Company accounts for operating lease obligations and sublease income
on a straight-line basis. Contingent or percentage payments are recognized when
operations indicate such amounts will be paid. Lease obligations paid in
advance are included in prepaid rent. The difference between actual lease
payments and straight-line lease expenses over the lease term is included in
deferred rent. Rent expense for all operating leases and rental income from
subleases are reflected in cost of parking or general and administrative
expenses.
Page 41 of 76 Table of Contents
In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company revalued certain
leases to estimated fair market value at the time of the respective
acquisition. Favorable operating leases of entities acquired represent the
present value of the excess of the current market rental over the contractual
lease payments. Unfavorable operating leases of entities acquired represent the
present value of the excess of the contractual lease payments over the current
market rental. Such adjustments are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
remaining term of the underlying lease, or 30years, whichever is shorter.
Favorable and unfavorable lease rights are reflected on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets in contract and lease rights and other liabilities,
respectively. k Property-Related Losses Gains, Net
Net property-related gains and losses on the accompanying consolidated
statements of earnings include irealized gains and losses on the sale of
property and equipment, iiimpairment of long-lived assets, and iiicosts
incurred to terminate existing parking facility leases prior to their
contractual termination date. l Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accounting for the Companys long-lived assets, other than goodwill,
the Company applies the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. Beginning October1, 2001, the
Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under the provisions
of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The determination and
measurement of an impairment loss under these accounting standards require the
significant use of judgment and estimates. Future events may impact these
judgments and estimates. m Income Taxes
The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company
uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. The Company does not provide for
federal income taxes on the accumulated earnings considered permanently
reinvested in foreign subsidiaries. n Pre-opening Expense
The direct and incremental costs of hiring and training personnel
associated with the opening of new parking facilities and the associated
internal development costs are expensed as incurred. o Per Share and Share Data
Basic net earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net earnings per share
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock
or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of
the Company. p Foreign Currency Translation
The financial position and results of operations of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries and equity method joint ventures are measured using local currency
as the functional currency. Translation adjustments arising from the
differences in exchange rates from period to period are generally included in
the currency translation adjustment in shareholders equity. qFair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company discloses the fair values of financial instruments for which
it is practicable to estimate the value. Fair value disclosures exclude certain
financial instruments such as trade receivables and payables when carrying
values approximate the fair value. The fair values of the financial instruments
are estimates based upon current market conditions and quoted market prices for
the same or similar instruments as of September30. Book value approximates
fair value for substantially all of the Companys assets, liabilities and
derivatives that fall under the fair value disclosure requirements.
Page 42 of 76 Table of Contents
r Stock Option Plan
The Company applies the intrinsic value based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for
its stock options. As such, compensation expense is recorded on the date of
grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the
exercise price. s Business Concentrations
Approximately 42% of the Companys total revenues for fiscal year 2002,
excluding reimbursement of management contract expenses, were attributable to
parking and management contract operations geographically located in the
northeastern area of the United States. See also Note 16. As of September30, 2002, approximately 23% of the Companys employees are
subject to various collective bargaining agreements as members of unions. t Risk Management
The Company utilizes a combination of indemnity and self-insurance
coverages, up to certain maximum losses for liability, health and workers
compensation claims. The accompanying consolidated balance sheets reflect the
estimated losses related to such risks. These policies have deductibles of up
to $250,000 per occurrence, which must be met before the insurance companies
are required to reimburse the Company for costs related to covered claims. As
a result, the Company is, in effect, self-insured for all claims up to the
deductible levels. u Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. v Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses variable rate debt to finance its operations. These debt
obligations expose the Company to variability in interest payments due to
changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense
increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also
decreases. Management believes it is prudent to limit the variability of its
interest payments.
To meet this objective, the Company enters into various types of
derivative instruments to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from
interest rate risk. These instruments include interest rate swaps and caps.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Company receives variable interest rate
payments and makes fixed interest rate payments, thereby creating fixed-rate
debt. The purchased interest rate cap agreements also protect the Company from
increases in interest rates that would result in increased cash interest
payments made under its Credit Facility. Under the interest rate cap
agreements, the Company has the right to receive cash if interest rates
increase above a specified level.
The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose
other than cash flow hedging purposes. That is, the Company does not speculate
using derivative instruments. The Company assesses interest rate cash flow
risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate
exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by
evaluating hedging opportunities. The Company maintains risk management
control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both
the Companys outstanding or forecasted debt obligations as well as the
Companys offsetting hedge positions. The risk management control systems
involve the use of analytical techniques, including cash flow sensitivity
analysis, to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on the
Companys future cash flows.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
SFAS No133 established reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. In June
2000, SFAS No138 Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No133, was issued
clarifying the accounting for derivatives under the new standard. On October
1, 2000, the Company prospectively adopted the provisions of SFAS No133 and
SFAS No138, which resulted in the recording of a net transition loss of $380
thousand, net of related income taxes of $253 thousand, in accumulated other
comprehensive loss. Under SFAS No133, the Company recognizes all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities, measured at fair
Page 43 of 76 Table of Contents value, in the statement of
financial position. Prior to adoption of SFAS No133 and SFAS No138, the
Company recorded interest rate cap instruments at cost and amortized these
costs into interest expense over the terms of the cap agreements. Amounts
received under the cap agreements were recorded against interest expense.
Amounts paid or received under the swap agreements were recorded as increases
or decreases to interest expense. The adoption of SFAS No133 and SFAS No.
138 resulted in the Company reducing derivative instrument assets by $280
thousand and recording $353 thousand of derivative instrument liabilities.
At September30, 2002, the Companys derivative financial instruments
consisted of three interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount
of $75million and two interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of
$38million. The derivative financial instruments are reported at their fair
values, and are included as other assets and other liabilities, respectively,
on the face of the balance sheet. The following table lists the fair value of
each type of derivative financial instrument amounts in thousands   
September 30, 2002

Derivative instrument assets:
Interest rate caps
$

Derivative instrument liabilities:

$
2,975
The underlying terms of the interest rate swaps and caps, including the
notional amount, interest rate index, duration, and reset dates, are identical
to those of the associated debt instruments and therefore the hedging
relationship results in no ineffectiveness. Accordingly, such derivative
instruments are classified as cash flow hedges. As such, any changes in the
fair market value of the derivative instruments are included in accumulated
other comprehensive loss on the face of the balance sheet. w Newly Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result
from the acquisition, construction, development and ornormal use of the
asset. SFAS No143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No143 for the
quarter ending December31, 2002. Management does not expect such adoption to
have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which supersedes both SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB
Opinion No30, Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for the disposal of a segment
of a business as previously defined in that Opinion. SFAS No144 retains
the fundamental provisions in SFAS No121 for recognizing and measuring
impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use and long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale. SFAS No144 also resolves certain implementation issues
associated with SFAS No121 by providing guidance on how a long-lived asset
that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment,
establishing criteria for when a long-lived asset is held for sale and
prescribing the accounting for a long-lived asset that will be disposed of
other than by sale. SFAS No144 retains the basic provisions of APB Opinion
No30 on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but
broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a
segment of a business. The Company will adopt SFAS No144 for the quarter
ending December31, 2002. Management does not expect such adoption to have a
material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The standard requires companies
to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are
incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan.
Examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and
certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring,
discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity.
SFAS No146 replaces EITF Issue No94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Page 44 of 76 Table of Contents Costs to Exit an Activity including
Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. SFAS No146 is to be applied
prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December31, 2002.
Management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated financial statements.
x Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. 2Business Combinations
USA Parking Systems
On October1, 2001, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets
of USA Parking Systems, Inc. for $115million in cash. The purchase included
61 management and lease contracts located primarily in south Florida and Puerto
Rico. The fair value of the assets acquired as of the acquisition date was as
follows in thousands

$
2,779
Noncompete agreement

Trade name
100
Contract rights
8,475
Net assets acquired
$
11,529
The tangible assets primarily consisted of accounts receivable and parking
equipment. The noncompete agreement is with the seller, who is now employed by
the Company. The duration of the agreement extends five years beyond the
sellers termination of such employment and will begin to be amortized when
such termination occurs. The trade name is included as goodwill and is not
subject to amortization. The contract rights are amortized over 15years,
which is the average estimated life of the contracts including future renewals.
The purchase agreement also contained an incentive provision whereby the
seller may receive an additional payment of up to $23million based on the
earnings of USA Parking for the twelve months ended March31, 2004. The
incentive provision is not conditional upon employment. Any amounts owed
under this incentive provision will be recorded as goodwill in the period
payment is made.
Universal Park Holdings
On October1, 2001, the Company purchased 100% of the common stock of
Universal Park Holdings Universal for $535 thousand. Universal provides
fee collection and related services for state, local and national parks and had
contracts to provide these services to six parks in the western United States
as of the acquisition date. The purchase price included $385 thousand paid in
cash at closing and a $150 thousand commitment to be paid after one year,
contingent upon retention of acquired contracts. Any amounts owed under this
contingent provision will be recorded as goodwill in the period payment is
made. The purchase resulted in goodwill of $646 thousand, which is not
deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition expanded the Companys presence
in the municipal, state and national parks market. Lexis Systems, Inc.
On October1, 2001, the Company purchased a 70% interest in Lexis Systems,
Inc. Lexis for $350 thousand in cash. Lexis manufactures and sells
automated pay stations used primarily for parking facilities. The purchase
resulted in goodwill of $134 thousand, which is not deductible for tax
purposes. The Company intends to use the automated pay stations in its
existing parking operations as well as for sale to other parking operators. Park One of Louisiana, LLC
On January1, 2002, the Company purchased certain assets and liabilities
of Park One of Louisiana, LLC, for $56million in cash. The purchase included
24 management and 17 lease contracts located in New Orleans, Louisiana. The
fair value of the assets acquired as of the acquisition date was as follows in

Page 45 of 76 Table of Contents
The tangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed consist primarily of
management accounts receivable and management accounts payable, respectively.
The contract rights will be amortized over 15years, which is the estimated
life of the contracts, including anticipated future renewals.
Pro forma results for fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000 are not presented as
the impact of acquisitions to reported results are not significant. Property acquisitions
In April 2002, the Company acquired four properties in Atlanta for $165
million, including acquisition costs. The purchase was funded through two
notes payable secured by the acquired properties. The notes require the
Company to make monthly interest payments at a weighted average rate of
one-month LIBOR plus 1575 basis points, with the principal balance due in
April 2007. The properties are currently being leased to another parking
operator. Lease rights
In January 2002, the Company purchased the lease rights for three
locations in New York City for $164million in cash. The lease rights are
being amortized over the remaining terms of the individual lease agreements,
which range from 10 to 30years. Previously, the Company had operated each of
these locations under an agreement entered into in September 1992. The 1992
agreement, which terminates in August 2004, initially covered approximately 80
locations; however, all but seven of these locations had been renegotiated with
extended terms or terminated as of September30, 2002. The Company intends to
enter into negotiations to extend the terms of these remaining locations prior
to the termination of the existing agreement. There can be no assurance that
these locations will be renewed or, if renewed, that the new agreements will
not have substantially different terms.
The Company is entitled to receive a termination fee, as defined in the
agreement, as the third party disposes of certain properties or renegotiates
the lease agreements. The termination fee is based on the earnings of the
location and the remaining duration of the agreement. During the year ended
September30, 2002, the Company received $84million in termination fees
related to the three locations described above and two additional locations
which were disposed of during the period. These amounts have been recorded as
deferred rent and will be amortized through August 2004 to offset the
guaranteed rent payments due under the original agreement.
3Notes Receivable
In connection with the acquisition of Kinney in February 1998, the Company
acquired a note receivable from the City of New York the City related to
two parking garages which were built on behalf of the City. The Company also
has a long-term management agreement to operate the parking garages. Amounts
advanced for the construction of the garages were recorded as a note receivable
and are being repaid by the City in monthly installments of $156 thousand,
including interest at a fixed rate of 80%, through December 2007. At
September30, 2002, the total of the note receivable was $84million.
In June 1997, Allright loaned the limited partner of Edison $165million
in connection with Allrights acquisition of its general partnership interest
in Edison. In conjunction with the merger of Allright and Central Parking, the
partnership agreement was restructured and an additional $99million was
advanced to the limited partner. The amended note receivable
totals $264million and bears interest at a fixed rate of 10%. The note
matures June1, 2006 and is secured by a pledge of, and security interest in,
the limited partners partnership interest in Edison.
In connection with the Allright merger, the Company acquired a mortgage
note of $25million, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 77%, from a
partnership which is secured by a parking garage and rental assignments. The
loan is a balloon note which matures in August 2010.
In connection with the acquisition of Allied in October 1998, the Company
obtained notes receivable totaling $49million, secured by an assignment of
rents from the properties being leased. The notes are payable monthly and bear
interest at a fixed rate of 70%.
Page 46 of 76 Table of Contents
The remainder of the notes receivable consist of notes ranging from $1
thousand to $25million at the end of fiscal year 2002, and notes ranging from
$3 thousand to $31million at the end of fiscal year 2001. The notes bear
interest at fixed rates ranging from 7% to 12% at the end of fiscal year 2002.

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No141, Business
Combinations, and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No.
141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business
combinations initiated after June30, 2001. SFAS No141 also specifies
criteria which intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business
combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS
No142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least
annually. Any impairment loss would be measured as of the date of adoption
and recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. SFAS No142
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized
over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
Page 47 of 76 Table of Contents
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No141 immediately. For the
Company, SFAS No142 had to be adopted by October1, 2002, but could be
adopted earlier. The Company elected early adoption of SFAS No142 as of
October1, 2001. SFAS No142 requires that the Company evaluate its existing
intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior business
combination and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform
with the new criteria in SFAS No141 for recognition apart from goodwill.
With the adoption of SFAS No142, the Company has reassessed the useful lives
and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in business combinations
and has determined that no amortization period adjustments are required. As of
September30, 2002, the Company has not identified any intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, other than goodwill.
The transitional provisions of SFAS No142 required the Company to
perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is
impaired as of the date of adoption. To accomplish this, the Company
identified its reporting units and determined the carrying value of each
reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing
goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the date of
adoption. The Company is structured into geographical segments. Each segment
consists of several cities which report to a single senior vice president.
For purposes of allocating and evaluating goodwill and intangible assets, the
Company considers each city to be a separate reporting unit. To the extent a
reporting units carrying amount exceeded its fair value, an indication exists
that the reporting units goodwill may be impaired and the Company performed
the second step of the transitional impairment test. In the second step, the
Company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill,
determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets
recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase
price allocation in accordance with SFAS No141, to its carrying amount, both
of which would be measured as of the date of adoption. The reporting units
fair value was determined by a third party appraisal. The Company completed
the transition process and recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting
change a charge of $93million net of an income tax benefit of $28 thousand
related to business units in Chicago and New Jersey as of October1, 2001.
As of September30, 2001, the Companys unamortized goodwill amounted to
$2506million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets amounted to $881
million, all of which were subject to the transition provisions of SFAS No.
142. The effects of adoption of SFAS No142 on results of operations for the
years ended September30, 2002, 2001 and 2000 are as follows in thousands,

6Property-Related Losses Gains, Net
The Company routinely disposes of owned properties due to various factors,
including economic considerations, unsolicited offers from third parties and
condemnation proceedings initiated by local government authorities. Leased
properties are also periodically evaluated and determinations may be made to
sell or exit a lease obligation. Additionally, during the year ended September
30, 2000, the Company divested certain owned and leased parking facilities
pursuant to a settlement agreement with the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice the DOJ in connection with the merger with
Allright.
All assets disposed of during the years ended September30, 2002, 2001 and
2000 were held for use at the time of disposal. A summary of property-related pretax gains and losses for the years ended

On January28, 2002, the Company sold its 50% interest in Civic Parking,
LLC Civic for $184million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of
$39million which is included as a property-related gain for the year ended
September30, 2002. Additionally, the Company recognized $52million of
pre-tax gains on sales of property during the year, primarily from the
condemnation of a property in Houston. These gains were offset by impairment
charges of $99million, comprised of $30million of leasehold improvements 23million of contract and lease rights and $46million of key money.
Impairment charges were the result of condemnations of $16million as well as
impairment charges of $83million for locations, primarily in New York City,
where the discounted projected future cash flows no longer supported the
carrying value of the assets.
Included in net gains on sale of property for fiscal year 2001 is a $250
thousand loss for environmental costs related to a property previously owned by
the Company. The Company recorded impairment charges of $83million in fiscal
year 2001, including $55million attributable to properties where the carrying
value of goodwill, contract rights and lease rights was no longer supportable
by discounted projected future cash flows, and $28million related to
equipment and leasehold improvements. Of these impairment charges, $34million
related to properties in New York, $28million in San Francisco 07million in New Jersey and the remaining $14million in various other
locations. The Company also incurred $77million of costs to exit unfavorable
lease agreements.
Impairment charges recognized in fiscal year 2000 include $33million
attributable to assets subsequently disposed of during the year. These
impairment charges were derived using estimates of net realizable values. The
remaining $15million impairment charge was attributable to assets held for
use, and was based on estimated fair value using estimated cash flows of the
applicable parking facility discounted at the Companys average cost of funds.

a Civic Parking, LLC
The Company sold its 50% joint venture ownership in Civic Parking LLC
Civic in January 2002. The partnership owned four parking garages and
retail space in St. Louis, Missouri. The Companys results of operations
include 50% of the net earnings of Civic for the periods presented prior
to the disposal date. b Commerce Street Joint Venture
The Company has a 50% interest in a joint venture that owns a parking
complex in Nashville, Tennessee. The complex consists of the original
parking garage and retail space the Original Facility and an addition
to the parking garage the Addition constructed several years after the
completion of the Original Facility. The joint venture financed the Original Facility with industrial
development bonds in the original principal amount of $86million the
SeriesA Bonds issued by The Industrial Development Board of the
Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County the Metro IDB
or Issuer in 1984. The Metro IDB holds title to the Original Facility,
which it leases to the joint venture under a lease expiring in 2014. The
lease of the Original Facility obligates the venture to make lease
payments corresponding to principal and interest payable on SeriesA Bonds
and provides the venture with an option to purchase the Original Facility
at any time by paying the amount due under the SeriesA Bonds and making a
nominal purchase payment to the Metro IDB. In 1994, the Issuer, at the
request of the Company, issued Series1994 Bonds in the amount of $67
million and applied the proceeds to refunding of the 1984 Bonds.
In June 2002, the Issuer, at the request of the Company issued $48
million of Series2002A variable rate revenue refunding bonds and $03
million of Series2002B Federally-taxable revenue refunding bonds
collectively, the Bonds. The series 2002A Bonds mature on January1,
2014 and the Series2002B Bonds mature on January1, 2003. The Bonds
require monthly interest payments. The proceeds of the Bonds were used to
repay the 1994 Bonds. As of September30, 2002, the Series2002A Bonds
had a variable rate of 188% and the Series2002B Bonds had a fixed rate
of 400%. The 2002A Bonds are subject to a mandatory sinking fund
redemption beginning January1, 2004 and on each January 1 thereafter. c Larimer Square Parking Associates
The Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture that owns a
parking complex in Denver, Colorado. The complex, which was completed in
February 1996, was constructed and financed by the joint venture partners.
The Company invested
Page 50 of 76 Table of Contents 991 thousand in the joint venture and loaned the
joint venture $11million in the form of a construction note, bearing
interest at a fixed rate of 95%, which was converted to a term note in
August 1996, following completion of the project. An additional $14
million was loaned by the Company which will be repaid through sales tax
and property tax revenues by the Denver Urban Renewal Authority at a fixed
interest rate of 10%. The Company manages the parking facility for the
venture. d Lodo Parking Garage, LLC
In March 1995, the Company acquired a 50% interest in a joint venture
which owns a parking complex in Denver, Colorado. The Company invested
$14million in the joint venture and manages the parking facility for the
joint venture. e CPS Mexico, Inc.
The Company holds a 50% interest in a Mexican joint venture which
manages and leases various parking structures in Mexico. The Company also
has loaned $80million and $27million at September30, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, to the affiliate. These loans bear interest at fixed rates
ranging from 10% to 12% and are included in current portion of notes
receivable on the Companys balance sheet at September30, 2002. In
October 2002, the Mexican joint venture refinanced its debt, resulting in
the Company receiving $64million in loan repayments. f Capital Commons
The Company held a 50% limited partnership interest in this
partnership. In fiscal year 2000, the Company recorded to equity in
partnership and joint venture earnings a $5million gain due to the sale
of a property by Capital Commons. The partnership was terminated
subsequent to this transaction. In fiscal year 2001, $170 thousand, which
was previously escrowed to cover certain legal fees incurred as part of
the property sale, was returned to the Company, resulting in the
recognition of an additional gain for that amount.

In March 1999, the Company entered into a credit facility the Credit
Facility initially providing for an aggregate availability of up to $400
million consisting of a five-year $200million revolving credit facility,
including a sub-limit of $40million for stand-by letters of credit, and a $200
million five-year term loan. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus
a grid-based margin dependent upon the Company achieving certain financial
ratios. The amount outstanding under the Companys Credit Facility was $2215
million with a weighted average interest rate of 32% as of September30, 2002,
including the principal amount of the term loan of $750million. The term
loan is required to be repaid in quarterly payments of $125million through
March 2004. The aggregate availability under the Credit Facility was $244
million at September30, 2002, which is net of $291million of stand-by
letters of credit. On February14, 2000, the Company entered into an amendment
and restatement to the Credit Facility agreement primarily to allow the Company
to repurchase up to $50million in outstanding
shares of its common stock. This amendment and restatement required the
Company to pay an amendment fee of $681 thousand, which is being amortized over
the life of the Credit Facility. Interest rates were not affected by this
amendment.
The Credit Facility contains covenants including those that require the
Company to maintain certain financial ratios and net worth, limit the amount of
dividends paid and restrict further indebtedness, stock repurchases and certain
transactions such as asset dispositions. The two primary ratios are a leverage
ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. Quarterly compliance is
Page 51 of 76 Table of Contents calculated
using a four quarter rolling methodology and measured against certain targets.
The grid-based interest rate margin is based upon the Company achieving
certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with these financial covenants as of September
30, 2002; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be in
compliance with one or more of these covenants in future quarters.
The Credit Facility matures in March 2004. The Company has begun
discussions related to replacing the Credit Facility and continues to evaluate
various financing alternatives as it seeks to optimize the rate, duration and
mix of its debt. The interest rates under any new borrowing arrangement would
likely increase as compared to the interest rates in the Credit Facility
considering the current credit markets. Additionally, any new borrowing arrangement could impose additional
covenants and restrictions.
The Company is required under the Credit Facility to enter into certain
interest rate protection agreements designed to fix interest rates on variable
rate debt and reduce the Companys cash flow exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates. On October27, 1999, the Company entered into a $25million
interest rate swap for a term of four years, cancelable after two years at the
option of the counterparty, under which the Company pays to the counterparty a
fixed rate of 616%, and the counterparty pays to the Company a variable rate
equal to LIBOR. The transaction involved an exchange of fixed rate payments
for variable rate payments and does not involve the exchange of the underlying
nominal value. On March31, 2000, June29, 2000, and again on September29,
2000, the Company entered into $25million interest rate cap agreements. The
rate is 80% for the first two cap agreements and 85% for the last cap
agreement and each has a term consistent with that of the Credit Facility. The
Company paid a total of $646 thousand for the three $25million cap agreements.
In April 2002, the Company acquired four properties in Atlanta for $165
million, including acquisition costs. The purchase was funded through two
notes payable secured by the acquired properties. The notes require the
Company to make monthly interest payments at a weighted average rate of
one-month LIBOR plus 1575 basis points, with the principal balance due in
April 2007. The properties are currently being leased to another parking
operator.
On March15, 2000, a limited liability company LLC of which the
Company is the sole shareholder purchased the Black Angus Garage, a multi-level
structure with 300 parking stalls, located in New York City, for $196million.
$133million of the purchase was financed through a five-year note bearing
interest at one month floating LIBOR plus 1625 basis points. The note is
collateralized by the parking facility. The $130million remaining principal
balance at September30, 2002 will be due at the end of the five-year loan
term. To hedge the Companys cash flow exposure to interest rate fluctuations,
the Company entered into a five-year LIBOR swap, yielding an effective interest
cost of 891% and an effective monthly principal and interest payment of
approximately $108 thousand for the five-year period. The Company guaranteed
$1million of the debt. The remainder of the purchase price was financed from
borrowings from the Credit Facility.
The Company also has several notes payable outstanding totaling $49
million at September30, 2002. These notes are secured by real estate and
equipment and bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 65% to 100%.

lease obligations, are as follows in thousands

In connection with the Kinney acquisition, the Company assumed an
agreement whereby a parking structure and the corresponding land upon which it
sits are leased under a long-term arrangement. The parking structure is
accounted for as a capital lease, and the underlying land is accounted for as
an operating lease. The original agreement called for lease payments over a
twenty-year term at a 174% interest rate. In connection with purchase
accounting, the carrying value of the related obligation was recorded at fair
value. The carrying amount of the capital lease obligation at September30,
2002 was $27million, bearing interest at
Page 52 of 76 Table of Contents a rate of 80% per annum and
requiring monthly payments of approximately $177,000. The operating lease
requires a payment of approximately $183,000 per month. The lease agreements
run through December 2003.
9Convertible Trust Issued Preferred Securities Offerings
On March18, 1998, the Company created Central Parking Finance Trust
Trust which completed a private placement of 4,400,000 shares at $2500 per
share of 525% convertible trust issued preferred securities Preferred
Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. The Preferred Securities represent preferred undivided
beneficial interests in the assets of Central Parking Finance Trust, a
statutory business trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware. The
Company owns all of the common securities of the Trust. The Trust exists for
the sole purpose of issuing the Preferred Securities and investing the proceeds
thereof in an equivalent amount of 525% Convertible Subordinated Debentures
Convertible Debentures of the Company due 2028. The net proceeds to the
Company from the Preferred Securities private placement were $1065million.
Each Preferred Security is entitled to receive cumulative cash distributions at
an annual rate of 525% or $1312 per share and will be convertible at the
option of the holder thereof into shares of Company common stock at a
conversion rate of 04545 shares of Company common stock for each Preferred
Security equivalent to $5500 per share of Company common stock, subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances. The Preferred Securities prohibit the
payment of dividends on Central Parking common stock if the quarterly
distributions on the Preferred Securities are not made for any reason. The
Preferred Securities do not have a stated maturity date but are subject to
mandatory redemption upon the repayment of the Convertible Debentures at their
stated maturity April1, 2028 or upon acceleration or earlier repayment of
the Convertible Debentures.
The Companys consolidated balance sheets reflect the Preferred Securities
of the Trust as company-obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible securities
of subsidiary holding solely parent debentures.
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No145, Rescission of FASB Statements
No4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No13, and Technical
Corrections. Among other provisions, this statement rescinds SFAS No4,
Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, which required that all
gains and losses on extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary
item, net of tax, on the face of the income statement. The statement is
effective for all fiscal years beginning after May15, 2002, but may be adopted
earlier. The Company adopted this statement in the third quarter of fiscal
year 2002, retroactive to October1, 2001. Prior periods have been
reclassified to conform to the new presentation. The other provisions of SFAS
No145 are not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial
statements.
On June28, 2002, the Company repurchased 138,800 shares of its Preferred
Securities for $25million. On March30, 2002, the Company repurchased
500,000 shares of its Preferred Securities for $93million. On December28,
2001, the Company repurchased 637,795 shares of the Preferred Securities for
$100million. For the year ended September30, 2002, these transactions
resulted in a reduction of $319million of the outstanding balance of the
Preferred Securities and pre-tax gains of $92million, net of writedowns of a
proportionate share of the related deferred finance costs of $09million.
Gains on the early extinguishment of debt were previously reported as
extraordinary items, net of tax, in the Companys statement of earnings, but
are now classified as a separate component of other income as a result of the
adoption of SFAS No145. All similar prior period gains have been
reclassified to conform to the new presentation.

Weighted average common shares used for the computation of basic earnings
per share excludes certain common shares issued pursuant to the Companys
restricted stock plan and deferred compensation agreement, because under the
related agreements the holders of restricted stock will forfeit such shares if
certain employment or service requirements are not met. The effect of the
conversion of the company-obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible
securities of the subsidiary trust has not been included in the diluted
earnings per share calculation since such securities were anti-dilutive for all
periods. At September30, 2002 and 2001, such securities were convertible into
1,419,730 and 2,000,000 shares of common stock. Options to acquire 517,695,
1,847,727 and 992,352 shares of common stock were excluded from the 2002, 2001
and 2000 diluted earnings per share calculations because they were
anti-dilutive.
11Operating Lease Commitments
The Company and its subsidiaries conduct a significant portion of their
operations on leased premises under operating leases expiring at various dates
through 2101. Lease agreements provide for minimum payments or contingent
payments based upon a percentage of revenue or, in some cases, a combination of
both types of arrangements. Certain locations additionally require the Company
and its subsidiaries to pay real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses.

As of September30, 2002, the Company has federal net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $401million and state and city net operating loss
carry forwards of approximately $957million which expire between 2003 and
2017. The ability of the Company to fully utilize these net operating losses is
limited due to changes in ownership of the companies which generated these
losses. These limitations have been considered in determining the deferred tax
asset valuation allowance shown above. Based on prior taxable income,
management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will
generate sufficient taxable income to realize deferred tax assets after giving
consideration to the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance has been
provided for net operating loss carry forwards for which recoverability is
deemed to be uncertain.
13Employee Benefit Programs
a Stock Plans
In August 1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved a stock
plan for key personnel, which included a stock option plan and a restricted
stock plan. Under this plan, incentive stock options, as well as nonqualified
options and other stock-based awards, may be granted to officers, employees and
directors. A total of 7,317,500 common shares have been reserved for issuance
under these two plans combined. Options representing 4,650,684 shares are
outstanding under the stock option plan at September30, 2002. Options are
granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of
grant, generally vest over a three- to four-year period and generally expire
ten years after the date of grant. At September30, 2002, 287,915 shares had
been issued through the restricted stock plan. Expense related to the vesting
of restricted stock is recognized by the Company over the vesting period.
Under the restricted stock plan, the Company granted 3,325 shares and 2,632
shares with weighted average fair values on grant date of $1902 per share and
$1845 per share during fiscal year 2002 and 2001, respectively.
In August 1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders also approved a
stock plan for directors. This plan provides for the grant, upon each
directors initial election, of options to purchase 11,250 shares at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant to each
non-employee director. In addition, each non-employee director who has served
for a minimum of six months on the last day of each fiscal year will receive
additional options to purchase 5,000 shares on that date.
A total of 475,000 shares have been reserved for issuance under the plan.
Options to purchase 219,500 shares are outstanding under this plan at September
30, 2002.

The Company accounts for these plans under Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly,
because such options are fixed awards, no compensation cost has been
recognized. If compensation cost for these plans had been determined consistent
with SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based-Compensation, the Companys net
earnings and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro

The estimated weighted average fair value of the options granted was
$1135 for 2002 option grants, $1051 for 2001 option grants and $1203 for
2000 option grants, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions: weighted average dividend yield based on historic
dividend rates at the date of grant, weighted average volatility of 41% for
fiscal year 2002, 67% for fiscal year 2001 and 70% for fiscal year 2000,
weighted average risk free interest based on the treasury bill rate of 10-year
instruments at the date of grant, and a weighted average expected term of six
years for all grants.
The Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which began on April
1, 1996, under which 450,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance. The plan allows participants to contribute up to 10% of their normal
pay as defined in the Plan to a custodial account for purchase of the
Companys common stock. Participants may enroll or make changes to their
enrollment annually, and they may withdraw from the plan at any time by giving
the Company written notice. Employees purchase stock annually following the end
of the plan year at a price per share equal to the lesser of 85% of the closing
market price of the Companys common stock on the first or the last trading day
of the plan year. At September30, 2002, 383,209 shares had been purchased
under this plan. b Profit-Sharing and 401k Plan
The Company has the Profit-Sharing and 401k Savings Plan that allows
eligible participants to make pretax contributions, receive Company 401k
match contributions and participate in discretionary Company profit-sharing
contributions. Employees 18years or older may participate in the Plan after
one year of continuous service, if the employee was employed prior to reaching
age 65. Participants contributions, Company 401k contributions and earnings
thereon immediately vest. Company profit-sharing contributions vest after two
years of continuous service at a rate of 20% per year so that participants are
fully vested at the end of seven years. Company expense associated with this
plan was $26million, $22million and $25million in years 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. c Incentive Compensation Agreements
The Company has incentive compensation agreements with certain key
employees. Participating employees receive an annual bonus based on
profitability of the operations and other factors for which they are
responsible. Incentive compensation expense is accrued during the year based
upon managements estimate of amounts earned under the related agreements.
Incentive compensation under all such agreements was approximately $63
million, $65million and $64million in years 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. d Deferred Compensation Agreements
The Company has an employment agreement with its President of
International Operations in which the officer is entitled to receive upon
retirement 267,750 shares of common stock which were issued in 1995 under the
Companys restricted stock plan. The Company recorded $705 thousand of
deferred compensation expense in its shareholders equity in fiscal year 1995,
which was being amortized ratably over the remaining expected term of the
officers employment. During fiscal year 2001 the agreement was amended to
allow the officer to receive all of the shares if he were to leave the Company
prior to his normal retirement date. Correspondingly, the Company transferred
267,750 shares of restricted common stock into a Rabbi Trust the Trust
owned by
Page 58 of 76 Table of Contents the Company. The officer has no authority over the administration of
the Trust. Transfer of these shares resulted in an increase in liabilities and
a decrease in equity of $705 thousand, including recognition of the remaining
deferred compensation expense of $335 thousand in fiscal year 2001, which
represented the unamortized portion of the deferred compensation at the
amendment date.
The Company has a deferred compensation agreement that entitles the
Chairman to receive annual payments of $500 thousand for a period of ten years
following his termination, for any reason other than death, in exchange for a
covenant not to compete. Thereafter, the officer is entitled to annual payments
of $300 thousand until his death and, in the event his wife survives him, she
is entitled to annual payments of $300 thousand until her death. The Company
recognizes annual compensation expense pursuant to this agreement equivalent to
the increase in the actuarially determined future obligation under the
agreement. Compensation benefitexpense associated with their agreements was
approximately $22 thousand, $591 thousand and $255 thousand in fiscal years
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. At September30, 2002, the Company had
recorded a liability of $40million associated with this plan.
Agreements with certain former key executives of Allright provide for
aggregate annual payments ranging from $20 thousand to $144 thousand per year
for periods ranging from 10years to life, beginning when the executive retires
or upon death or disability. Under certain conditions, the amount of deferred
benefits can be reduced. Life insurance contracts with a face value of
approximately $92million have been purchased to fund, as necessary, the
benefits under these agreements. The cash surrender value of the life insurance
contracts is approximately $20million and $19million at September30, 2002
and 2001, respectively, and is included in other non-current assets. The plan
is a nonqualified plan and is not subject to ERISA funding requirements.
Deferred compensation costs for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $296 thousand, $121
thousand and $159 thousand, respectively. At September30, 2002, the Company
had recorded a liability of $61million associated with this plan. e Deferred Unit Plan
On December19, 1996, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the
Companys Deferred Stock Unit Plan. Under the plan, certain key employees have
the opportunity to defer the receipt of certain portions of their cash
compensation, instead receiving shares of common stock following certain
periods of deferral. The plan is administered by a committee, appointed by the
board of directors of the Company consisting of at least two non-employee
outside directors of the Company. The Company reserved 375,000 shares of
common stock for issuance under the 1996 Deferred Stock Unit Plan. Participants
may defer up to 50% of their salary. As of September30, 2002, $21million of
compensation has been deferred under this plan. f Restricted Stock Units
The Company recorded compensation expense of $255 thousand during fiscal
year 2002 related to restricted stock units granted under individual employment
agreements with certain key executives. The Company recorded $765 thousand
during fiscal year 2002 as a charge to stockholders equity related to these 40
thousand restricted stock units. This charge to stockholders equity will be
amortized over the vesting period of the restricted stock units, which ranges
from four to five years. Upon vesting, these restricted stock units will be
settled by issuance of one share of the Companys common stock for each
restricted stock unit. 14Related Parties
The Company leases two properties from an entity 50% owned by the
Companys chairman for $290 thousand per year for a 10-year term and pays
percentage rent to the entity. Total rent expense, including percentage rent,
was $268 thousand, $355 thousand and $434 thousand in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The Company will receive 25% of the gain in the event of a sale
of these properties during the term of the lease pursuant to the lease
agreements. Management believes that such transactions have been on terms no
less favorable to the Company than those that could have been obtained from
unaffiliated persons.
In connection with the acquisition of Kinney, the Company entered into a
consulting agreement with a director of the Company. The Company paid $200
thousand to the director pursuant to this agreement during fiscal year 2002.
Additionally, the Company has entered into a limited partnership agreement with
the same director whereby the director has agreed to seek new business
opportunities in the form of leases and management contracts and renewals of
existing leases and contracts as requested by the Company. During the fiscal
years ended September30, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized expense
of $221 thousand, $391 thousand and $220 thousand, respectively, in connection
with this agreement.
Page 59 of 76 Table of Contents
During fiscal year 2000, a former director of the Company exercised a
purchase option on a property owned by the Company. The purchase price was
$83million. The Company recognized a gain of $27million in connection with
the sale of the property.
15Contingencies The Company entered into a partnership agreement effective June1, 2000,
to operate certain locations in Puerto Rico. The Company is the general
partner. The partners entered into an option agreement on that date whereby
the other partner has the option to sell its partnership interest to the
Company during the period from May1, 2003 to November30, 2003. If the other
partner does not exercise its option, then the Company has an option to
purchase the other partners interest during the period from May1, 2004 to
October31, 2004. The agreed upon purchase price under both of these options
is approximately $143million, backed by a letter of credit provided by the
Companys Chairman. The Company believes that it is probable that one of these
options will be exercised during fiscal year 2003 and, accordingly, has
included this commitment on its balance sheet in accrued expenses as of
September30, 2002. The commitment was classified in other liabilities at
September30, 2001.
The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit brought by Texas Gulf Bank and
other trustees and individuals on behalf of the owners of an undivided interest
in a undeveloped city block in downtown Houston that was leased to a subsidiary
of Allright. Allright leased the block as a parking lot under a series of
leases from 1985 to 2000 under which Allright was obligated to pay base rent
plus a percentage of revenues above a specified threshold level. Plaintiffs
have alleged substantial underpayment of percentage rent under the lease as a
result of theft and fraud. Plaintiffs have asserted causes of action for
breach of contract, conversion, common law fraud, fraud in the inducement and
fraudulent concealment. Based on the most recent court filings, the plaintiffs
are seeking compensatory damages of approximately $12million plus
approximately $4million in attorneys fees. In addition, plaintiffs are
seeking punitive damages in an unspecified amount. The compensatory damages
being sought by the plaintiffs include approximately $650,000 in underpaid
revenues and $12million in interest, fees and expenses for the 1996 to 2000
lease period; and approximately $15million in underpaid revenues and $84
million in interest, fees and expenses for the 1985 to 1996 lease
period. In an
attempt to settle the case, the Company paid during fiscal year 2002
approximately $650 thousand into the court registry. The
owner of approximately 15% of the lot settled her interest in the lawsuit
earlier this year. However, efforts to settle with the owners of the remaining
85% have been unsuccessful to date, and there can be no assurance the Company
will be able to settle with the remaining owners on terms favorable to the
Company. The suit, which was filed in June 2001, is pending in the 270th
Judicial District Court in Harris County, Texas. Plaintiffs have requested a
jury trial. The case currently is scheduled for trial in February 2003.
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, which
arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate liability with respect to those proceedings and claims,
other than the Houston lawsuit discussed above, will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial position, operations, or liquidity of
the Company. The Company maintains liability insurance coverage for individual
claims in excess of various dollar amounts, subject to annual aggregate limits.
The primary amount of such coverage is $1million per occurrence and $2
million in the aggregate per facility. In addition, the Company purchases
umbrella/excess liability coverage. The Companys various liability insurance
policies have deductibles of up to $250,000 that must be met before
the insurance companies are required to reimburse the Company for costs
and liabilities relating to covered claims. As a result, the Company is, in
effect, self-insured for all claims up to the deductible levels.
16Business Segments
The Companys business activities consist of domestic and foreign
operations. Foreign operations are conducted in the United Kingdom, Canada,
Spain and Ireland. The Company also conducts business through joint ventures in
Mexico, Germany, Poland and Chile. Revenues attributable to foreign operations
were less than 10% of consolidated revenues for each of fiscal years 2002, 2001
and 2000. In 2002, the United Kingdom and Canada account for 535% and 234%
of total foreign revenues, respectively.
