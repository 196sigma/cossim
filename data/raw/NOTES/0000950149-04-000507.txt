49 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents REPORT OF
ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Ask Jeeves, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Ask Jeeves, Inc. as of December31, 2003
and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2003. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Table of Contents as a2. These financial
statements and the financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and the financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Ask Jeeves, Inc. at
December31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company Ask Jeeves, Inc. Ask Jeeves or the
Company is a provider of Web-based search
technologies. The Company creates a search experience focused on
understanding users specific needs and interests and
connecting them to the most relevant information, products and
services. Until July1, 2003, the Company operated
through two divisions, Web Properties and Jeeves Solutions. On
July1, 2003, the Company sold certain assets used in the
Jeeves Solutions business to Kanisa Inc. Kanisa,
at which time the Company ceased offering Jeeves Solutions
software and services to corporate customers as described in
Note17 Discontinued Operations. Jeeves Solutions
core software application, JeevesOne, allowed corporate
customers to add its intuitive search engine to their corporate
Internet or intranet sites. With the purchase of additional
modules, JeevesOne allowed users to search and access a variety
of linked enterprise systems and legacy databases. The Company operates four proprietary Web sites
dedicated to search; Ask.com, Ask.co.uk, Teoma.com and
AJKids.com. The Company also delivers, or syndicates, its
search technology and advertising products to third-party Web
sites, including portals, infomediaries, and content and
destination Web sites. The company provides search results
and/or advertising for those Web sites to display in response to
their users search queries. The company refers to these
third-party Web sites as its syndication network. The Company was incorporated in California in
June 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1999. Basis of
Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Investments in the Ask Jeeves Japan
joint venture in which the Company has significant influence but
does not have a controlling interest are accounted for under the
equity method and investments in which the Company does not have
the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for at
cost. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated upon consolidation. Use of
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ materially from those
estimates. Cash and Cash
Equivalents The Company considers all cash and highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of less than three months
at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Highly liquid
investments included in cash and cash equivalents include
commercial paper and short-term U.S., state and government
securities. 55 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents
are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.
Substantially all of the Companys cash and cash
equivalents are held in the custody of three major financial
institutions. Marketable
Securities The Companys marketable securities are
primarily comprised of U.S., state and municipal government
securities and corporate debt securities. Marketable securities
are primarily held in the custody of two major financial
institutions. The specific identification method is used to
determine the cost of securities sold. At December31, 2003
and 2002, all of the Companys marketable securities were
classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities
are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses on
these securities included as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income loss. The Company performs periodic reviews of its
investments for impairment. Impairment write-downs create a new
carrying value for investments and the Company does not record
subsequent increases in fair value in excess of the new carrying
value. Allowances for Doubtful
Accounts The Company makes judgments as to its ability to
collect outstanding receivables and provides an allowance for
the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful.
Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all
significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not
specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing
rates, based upon the age of the receivable. In determining
these percentages, the Company has analyzed its historical
collection experience and current economic trends. The Company also records a provision for returns
and revenue adjustments in the same period as the related
revenues are recorded. These estimates are based on historical
analysis of credit memo data and other factors. Concentrations, Credit
Risk and Credit Risk Evaluations Concentrations During the years ended December31, 2003 and
2002, one provider accounted for 55% and 15%, respectively, of
revenues from continuing operations. No customer accounted for
more than 10% of revenues for the years ended December31,
2001. As a percentage of accounts receivable, one provider
accounted for 39% and 14% of gross accounts receivable as of
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
Companys U.S.agreement with this provider is
scheduled to terminate in September 2005 but allows for
termination for convenience by either party during September or
October of 2004, and the Companys U.K. agreement with
this provider is scheduled to terminate in May 2005. The Company relies on third-party advertising
services, provided by one supplier, to deliver advertisements to
its users. The Company is dependent on the ability of its
supplier to deliver the advertisements as contracted for and on
favorable pricing terms. The inability of the supplier to do so
could have a material impact on the consolidated results of
operations of the Company. Both the U.S. and Europe agreements
with this provider will expire on February27, 2007. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily
of cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities,
and trade receivables. Cash and cash equivalents consist
principally of demand deposit and money market accounts, and
commercial paper. Marketable securities consist primarily of
U.S., state and municipal government 56 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents securities and corporate debt securities with
strong credit ratings. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities are held at three major financial institutions with
high credit standing. The Company has not experienced any
significant losses on its cash and cash equivalents or
marketable securities. The Company conducts business with
companies in various industries in the United States and United
Kingdom. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers and generally does not require collateral. Allowances
are maintained for potential credit issues, and are adjusted
periodically to reflect managements expectations of future
losses. Property and
Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
amortization are computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, typically two to five
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
the useful life or the remaining lease term. Computer Software for
Internal Use The Company capitalizes certain costs related to
software developed or obtained for internal use once certain
criteria have been met. To date, these amounts have not been
significant. Software Development
Costs Development costs related to software
incorporated in the Companys products incurred subsequent
to the establishment of technological feasibility are
capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the
related products. Technological feasibility is established upon
completion of a working model. To date, costs incurred
subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility
have not been significant, and all software development costs
have been charged to product development expense in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Long-Lived
Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. The
Company does not perform a periodic assessment of assets for
impairment in the absence of such information or indicators.
Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment
include a significant decline in the observable market value of
an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which
an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets
is not recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used,
the Company measures fair value based on quoted market prices or
based on discounted estimates of future cash flows. Long-lived
assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to
sell. Revenue RevenueContinuing Operations The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the
fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. If
the Company has doubt about the collectibility of revenue at the
time it is earned, such revenue is deferred until cash has been
received. Revenues are generated from four general sources   
sales of premier listings and other paid
placement products;
sales of branded advertising products;
57 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents   
sales of paid inclusion products; and
licensing of search technologies.
The Companys premier listings and other
paid placement products are textual or Web links, that are
designed to connect users interested in a particular product or
service with an advertiser offering that product or service as
users need the information, much like a Yellow Pages listing.
With these products, advertisers pay only for performance, so
these revenues are generated when a user clicks on the link to
the advertisers Web site on a cost per click, or
CPC, basis. The Company recognizes CPC revenue on a
revenue-sharing basis, as the service is delivered, if the paid
placement was procured from its third-party provider. The Companys branded advertising ranges
from highly targeted graphic units through its Branded Response
product to traditional advertising units such as banners, towers
and interstitials, which appear primarily on its syndicated
sites. Branded advertising is generally sold on a cost per
impression, or CPM, basis with the revenue derived
from such arrangements recognized during the period that the
service is provided, provided that no significant obligations
remain outstanding from the Company to the advertiser at the end
of the period. The Companys obligations typically include
a guaranteed minimum number of impressions or times
that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of its
online properties. To the extent the minimum guaranteed
impressions are not delivered, the Company defers recognition of
the corresponding revenue until the remaining guaranteed
impressions levels are achieved. The Companys paid inclusion products
provide an opportunity for Web sites to ensure that they are
included in the Companys search index. The Company
recognizes paid inclusion revenue in two ways. First, on a
per URL basis, in which the revenues are collected
in advance and recognized over the appropriate service period,
which is typically one year; and second on a CPC basis, in which
the revenue is recognized when the click is delivered. License payments received from the Companys
Japanese joint venture are recorded as deferred revenue and are
recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over a four-year
period. The Companys license revenue will terminate after
the second quarter of 2004. The Companys syndication services include
the sale of advertising and paid placement products, and the
licensing of its search technology to third-party Web sites.
Syndication license fees primarily arise from revenue-sharing
arrangements, fixed fee arrangements or fee-per-use
arrangements, and revenues are recognized as the service is
delivered. The Company allocates its syndication revenues among
its four revenue categories, paid placement, branded
advertising, paid inclusion, and license fees, as applicable,
when reporting its results. Revenues from revenue-sharing
arrangements are recorded gross, including amounts paid to
syndication partners, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No99-19, because the Company acts as the
primary obligor in the arrangement, performs a significant
portion of the service, has latitude in establishing the price
and bears credit risk. Revenue Discontinued Operations: Jeeves
Solutions Revenues from the discontinued Jeeves Solutions
operation were derived from two sources: software licenses and
services. Software license revenues were generated from
companies licensing the rights to use the Companys natural
language and customer intelligence technologies for use on their
corporate Web sites. Services revenues were generated from sales
of maintenance agreements, consulting services and training
services associated with the Companys licensed software. The Company recognized software license revenues
in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition or SOP97-2, as
amended by Statement of 58 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents Position98-9. SOP97-2 provides
specific industry guidance and stipulates that revenue
recognized from software arrangements is to be allocated to each
element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of
the elements. Under SOP97-2, the determination of fair
value is based on objective evidence that is specific to the
vendor. The Company utilized the residual method under which
revenue is allocated to the undelivered element, based on vendor
specific evidence of fair value, and the residual amount of
revenue is allocated to the delivered element. The Company recognized license revenues at the
end of the core implementation period if implementation services
were included in the original license arrangement and were
considered to be essential to the functionality of the software.
As a result, even where the Company had a signed license
agreement for the purchase of its software and had delivered the
software, license revenue recognition depended on whether it had
begun core implementation. For license agreements under which
the Company had no implementation responsibility, or where
implementation was not considered to be essential to the
functionality of the software, the Company recognized revenue
upon delivery of the software. Examples of situations under
which the Company had no implementation responsibility included
additional license sales to existing customers or to customers
who elected to use internal or third party resources to
implement the software. In software license arrangements where a
service element was critical to the functionality of the
software, license, implementation and service fees were
recognized ratably over the life of the arrangement, commencing
upon service implementation. The Company generally provided consulting and
training services on a time and materials basis. It provided
maintenance and support services under renewable, term
maintenance agreements, which it priced as a percentage of its
license fees. Maintenance and support fee revenue was recognized
ratably over the contractual term, which was generally twelve
months and commenced from the implementation of service or
delivery of product. Amounts paid prior to service
implementation were recorded as deferred revenue, with
recognition commencing upon service implementation. Stock-Based
Compensation The Company accounts for employee stock options
using the intrinsic value method and makes the required pro
forma disclosures as if the fair value method had been used.
Compensation expense based on the difference, if any, on the
measurement date generally the date of grant, between the
estimated fair value of the Companys stock and the
exercise price of options to purchase that stock is amortized
over the vesting period of the related option using the graded
vesting method. Pro Forma Disclosures
of the Effect of Stock-Based Compensation Pro forma information regarding the results of
operations and net income loss per share is determined as if
the Company had accounted for its employee stock options using
the fair value method. The fair value of each option granted is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes valuation
model. The risk-free interest rate was 29% for 2003 and 50%
for each of the years 2002 and 2001. The expected life of
options granted in the years ended December31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, was 76years 100years, and
90years, respectively. No dividend and a volatility
factor of 11, 12, and 16 for 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively, were used. The Company has elected to use the intrinsic
value method in accounting for its employee stock options
because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value
accounting requires the use of option valuation models that were
not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under
the intrinsic value method, when the exercise price of the
Companys employee stock options equals the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation
expense is recognized. 59 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents The option valuation models were developed for
use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected life of the option. Because
the Companys employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value of the estimate, in managements
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock
options. Had compensation cost for the Companys
stock-based compensation plans been determined using the fair
value at the grant dates for awards under those plans calculated
using the Black Scholes valuation model, the Companys net
income loss and basic and diluted net income loss per share
would have been increased or decreased to the pro forma amounts
indicated below in thousands, except per share amounts

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of
options granted was $878, $137, and $119 for grants made
during years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Advertising
Costs The Company expenses the costs of advertising as
incurred. Advertising expense of continuing operations for the
years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
$63million, $13million, and $26million,
respectively. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method
to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. The Company currently has
substantial net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has
recorded a 100% valuation allowance against net deferred tax
assets due to uncertainty of their ultimate realization. Foreign Currency
Translation The functional currency of Ask Jeeves U.K. is the
British pound. The financial statements of this subsidiary are
translated to U. S. dollars using rates of exchange at the
balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, and average rates
of exchange for the year of revenues, costs and expenses.
Translation gains losses are deferred and accumulated in
accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of 60 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents stockholders equity. Net gains and losses
resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in the
consolidated statements of operations. The Company did not incur
significant net gains or losses resulting from foreign exchange
transactions during the periods presented. The functional currency of Ask Jeeves Europe is
the U.S.dollar. Gains and losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions are included in current results of
operations. Net Income Loss Per
Share Basic net income lossper share is
computed by dividing net income loss for the period by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted net income loss per share is computed by
dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive
effect of outstanding stock options, warrants, and convertible
subordinated notes. Potentially dilutive securities have been
excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as
their effect is antidilutive. Recent Accounting
Pronouncements In January 2003 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The
interpretation defines variable interest entities as those in
which equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other parties, or entities in which
equity investors lack certain essential characteristics of a
controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a
variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of
the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its
expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding
variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or
other pecuniary interests in an entity. The primary beneficiary
is required to consolidate the financial position and results of
operations of the variable interest entity. In December 2003,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, issued revisions to
FASB Interpretation 46, resulting in multiple effective dates
based on the characteristics as well as the creation dates of
the variable interest entities, however with no effective date
later than the Companys first quarter of 2004. The Company
does not believe that adoption of this statement will have a
material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the Securities and Exchange
Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulleting No104
Revenue Recognition SAB 104, which updates and
summarizes the Commissions views on the application of generally
accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in
financial statements. The Company believes that its revenue
recognition policies conform to the requirements of SAB 104. Reclassifications Certain prior year balances have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 2.BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS Acquisition of Teoma
Technologies, Inc. In September 2001, the Company acquired Teoma
Technologies, Inc, Teoma a developer of next generation search
technologies. The purpose of the acquisition was to enhance the
Companys strategy of providing intuitive relevant
technologies and services. Teomas technology divides the
Web into natural communities and analyzes topic-specific Web
content to generate relevant and authoritative search results. 61 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
business combination. The purchase cost consisted of cash of
$17million, 21million shares of common stock with
a fair value of $19million, 415,000 assumed stock options
with a fair value of $183,000, the assumption of liabilities of
$488,000 and transaction expenses of $187,000. The purchase cost
was allocated to equipment and other assets $16million
and developed technology $28million. The purchased
technology is being amortized into cost of revenues over a
period of three years. The acquisition of Teoma was recorded as a
purchase and accordingly, the consolidated financial statements
include the operating results of Teoma from the date of
acquisition, which occurred in September 2001. The financial
results of Teoma prior to the period of acquisition are not
material to the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Joint
Ventures Ask Jeeves U.K. In February 2002, the Company acquired the entire
outstanding equity interests in Ask Jeeves U.K. Previously, the
Company held a fifty percent interest in Ask Jeeves U.K., a
joint venture partnership with Carlton Communications PLC and
Granada Media Group Limited, that was formed to market the
Companys search and self-service technologies and services
in the United Kingdom. The Company acquired full ownership of
Ask Jeeves U.K. to enhance the synergies that exist between the
U.S. and U.K. operations. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
business combination and accordingly, the consolidated financial
statements include the operating results of Ask Jeeves U.K. from
the date of acquisition. During 2003, the Company recognized a gain of
$61million in connection with this transaction. This
amount represents the fair value of net assets the Company
recorded in excess of the consideration paid upon the
acquisition of the remaining outstanding equity interests in its
joint venture which was deferred due to a contingent payment
obligation in the Companys agreement with its former
partners. The gain was recognized as other income when the
contingent payment obligation to the former partners expired in
March 2003. During 2002, the Company recognized a gain of
$974,000 representing the remaining balance of deferred license
fees paid to it by Ask Jeeves U.K., for a licensing arrangement
that was terminated when the Company acquired the entity. The
gain was recognized as other income. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
business combination and accordingly, the consolidated financial
statements include the operating results of Ask Jeeves U.K. from
the date of acquisition. Previously, the Company accounted for
its investment in the joint venture under the equity method of
accounting. The Company had recorded no value for its interest
in the joint venture for accounting purposes. Therefore, the
Company had not previously recognized any portion of the net
losses of the joint venture. The unaudited pro forma information
presented in the table below 62 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents represents the combined
revenue, net loss, and net loss per share of the Company as if
the acquisition had taken place on January1, 2001.

Ask Jeeves en Espanol In August 2000, Ask Jeeves entered into a Spanish
language joint venture, partnering with Univision
Communications, Inc. to create Ask Jeeves en Espanol, Inc. The
Company subsequently dissolved the joint venture in October
2001. In connection with the dissolution, the Company received
cash of approximately $75million and reacquired the
rights and licenses originally assigned to the venture. The
Company recorded a gain of approximately $134million
during 2001, representing the remaining balance of deferred
license fees paid to the Company by the venture as well as the
value of cash received by the Company. The Company had
previously carried its investment in the venture at a carrying
value of zero. During 2003, the Company recognized a gain of
$232,000 relating to the final dissolution of the accounts of
Ask Jeeves en Espanol, following the wind up of operations. Ask Jeeves Japan Ask Jeeves Japan, a joint venture with Trans
Cosmos Inc. USA, a subsidiary of a Japanese customer service and
information technology support provider, was established to
launch a Japanese language version of Ask.com, create
Japanese specific content for the Japanese Ask.com Web
site, and to market Jeeves Solutions products and services to
the Japanese marketplace. The Company owns approximately
47percent of the voting securities of this joint venture.
In connection with the establishment of Ask Jeeves Japan, Ask
Jeeves granted the joint venture an exclusive license to the
Companys current and future products and services in Japan
and for the Japanese-speaking market. The Company has entered into various agreements
with these joint ventures for the license and support of its
technology within the United Kingdom, Japan and to the Spanish
speaking market. In connection with these agreements, the
Company received cash payments, all of which were funded by the
Companys joint venture partners, that were recorded as
deferred revenues and to the extent not already realized are
being recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over three
to four year periods. For the years ended December31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded revenues of
$45million, $62million, and $190million,
respectively, relating to these license arrangements. 3.MARKETABLE
SECURITIES At December31, 2003 and 2002, all of the
Companys marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate
classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase
and re-evaluates such designation at the end of each period.
Marketable securities are carried at fair value, based on quoted
market prices. For the years ended December31, 2003 and
2002, gross realized gains were $2,000 and $160,000,
respectively. 63 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents The following tables summarize the Companys

and $381,000, respectively. Aggregate future minimum rentals to
be received under non-cancelable subleases as of
December31, 2003 are $228,000. 7.LINE OF
CREDIT The Company has a revolving line of credit with a
bank in the amount of $150million. The line of credit
expires on July1, 2005. Borrowings under the line of
credit bear fixed rate interest from the date of borrowing at
LIBOR plus 04%. All borrowings and letters of credit under the
credit facility are collateralized by an equal amount of the
Companys marketable securities. Borrowings under the line
are subject to various covenants. As of December31, 2003,
no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit. Standby
letters of credit of approximately $104,000, which are being
maintained as security for performance under various
obligations, were issued and outstanding under the credit
facility. 65 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents 8.CONVERTIBLE
SUBORDINATED NOTES In June 2003, the Company issued
$1150million aggregate principal amount of zero coupon
convertible subordinated notes, due June1, 2008. The notes
were sold at face value and the net proceeds to the Company were
$1117million, net of costs of issuance of
$33million, which have been recorded as other assets and
are being amortized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
over the contractual term of the notes. The fair value of the
convertible subordinated notes was $1478million at
December 31, 2003, based on recent trading activity. The notes are convertible by the holders into
shares of the Companys common stock at any time at an
initial conversion price of $1690per share subject to
certain adjustments. This is equivalent to a conversion rate of
approximately 591716shares per $1,000 principal amount of
notes. Upon conversion, the Company has the right subject to
certain conditions to deliver cash or a combination of cash and
shares in lieu of shares of its common stock. The notes are subordinated in right of payment to
all existing and future senior indebtedness, as defined in the
indenture. The holders of the notes may require the Company to
repurchase all or a portion of the notes, subject to specified
exceptions, upon the occurrence of a change in control. The
Company may choose to pay the repurchase price in cash, shares
of its common stock, shares of the surviving corporation or a
combination thereof. The Company may not redeem the notes prior
to the maturity date. 9.PROVISION FOR

A valuation allowance has been established and,
accordingly, no benefit has been recognized for the
Companys net operating losses and other deferred tax
assets. The net valuation allowance increased by
$144million and $108million during the years ended
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company
believes that, based on a number of factors, the available
objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the
realizability of the deferred tax assets such that a full
valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include the
Companys cumulative net losses in recent years and
accumulated deficit. The Company will continue to assess the
realizability of the deferred tax assets based on actual and
forecasted operating results. Net operating loss NOL carryforwards resulting
from the exercise of employee stock options provided a deferred
benefit of $256million as of December31, 2003. Such
deferred tax benefit has been offset by a valuation allowance
and will be credited to stockholders equity when realized.
A tax benefit of approximately $12million, associated
with the exercise of employee stock options, was credited to
stockholders equity in 2003. At December31, 2003, the Company had NOLs
for federal income tax purposes of approximately
$2510million, which expire in the years 2012 through
2023. The Company also had net operating loss carryforwards for
California state income tax purposes of approximately
$811million that expire in the years 2004 through 2014.
California suspended the use of NOLs for the tax years 2002 and
2003. 67 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents Utilization of the Companys net operating
loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual
limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by
the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an
annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net
operating loss carryforwards before utilization. Applicable U.S. income taxes have not been
provided on approximately $173million of undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December31, 2003
since these earnings are considered indefinitely invested. The
income tax that would arise if these items were repatriated is
approximately $69million, some or all of which may be

IMPAIRMENT AND FACILITY EXIT CHARGES The Companys Board of Directors approved a
realignment of the business organization in an effort to
streamline operations, increase revenues, reduce costs and bring
staffing in line with the Companys anticipated
requirements. In the year ended December31, 2001, the
Company reported charges of approximately $118million,
which included approximately $113million related to
facility consolidations in California, as a result of
unsuccessful attempts to sublease in a rapidly deteriorating
market which led to the Companys decision to terminate a
significant lease obligation for a termination fee. In addition,
the charge included additional severance pay and medical and
other benefits of approximately $400,000 and an asset write-off
related to the termination of the Evergreen operation of
approximately $100,000. In April 2001, the Company implemented an
additional restructuring program, approved by its Board of
Directors, which included a reduction in force of approximately
73 employees. The reductions came from all areas of the Company
and, as of April30, 2001, all of the affected employees
had been notified and the majority of these terminations were
completed. In the year ended December31, 2001, the Company
reported charges of $27million under this program, which
included approximately $17million related to costs
associated with employee terminations, which included severance
pay and medical and other benefits plus accounting and legal
costs; approximately $500,000 related to the termination of a
marketing agreement; and $500,000 in estimated facility exit
costs associated with the consolidation of facilities in New
York. In September 2001, the Companys Board of
Directors approved a further restructuring program aimed at
streamlining its underlying cost structure to better position
the Company for growth and improved operating results. As part
of the restructuring program, the Company implemented a
reduction in force of approximately 43 positions over the third
and fourth quarters of the year ended December31, 2001.
The reductions came from all areas of the Company and, as of
December31, 2001, the employees had been notified and the
majority of these terminations were completed. In the year ended
December31, 2001, the Company reported a charge of
approximately $36million under this program, which
included a charge of 1approximately $20million in

and facilities exit costs. During the second and third quarters,
the Company implemented workforce reductions totaling
approximately 102positions and resulting in charges of

benefits. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the Company
revised its assumptions relating to its ability to sublease
vacated facilities, resulting in facilities exit charges
totaling $11million. In the year ended December31, 2003, the
Company incurred restructuring charges of $466,000 in connection
with the termination of certain employees of the discontinued
Jeeves Solutions division. The following table sets forth the restructuring

During 2003 and 2002, the Company wrote off
computer equipment, software, and furniture and fixtures that
the Company disposed of or were no longer in use, resulting in
changes of $702,000 and $22million, respectively. During 2002, the Company recorded an impairment
charge of $252,000 related to the intangible assets of E-tours,
as the Company discontinued offering this service. During 2001, the Company identified indicators of
possible impairment of its long-lived assets, consisting
principally of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets.
These indicators included the acquisition of Teoma Technologies,
Inc leading to potential obsolescence of previously acquired
technology, continued deterioration in the business climate for
Internet advertising, significant declines in the market values
of the Companys competitors in the Internet advertising
industry and changes in its 2001 operating and cash flow
forecasts. With the assistance of independent valuation
experts, the Company performed asset impairment tests at the
enterprise level, the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows related to its acquired intangible
assets and goodwill. The tests were performed by comparing the
expected undiscounted cash flows for a four-year period, plus a
terminal value for future cash flows, to the carrying amount of
the long-lived assets resulting from purchase business
combinations. Based on the results of these tests, the Company
determined that the long-lived assets initially recorded in
connection with its business combinations were impaired. With
the assistance of independent valuation experts, the Company
determined the fair value of the impaired long-lived assets.
Fair value was determined using the discounted cash flow method.
A write-down of long-lived assets totaling $3552million,
allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, was
recorded during 2001 reflecting the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceed their respective fair values. The Company also recorded write-downs to
estimated fair value of non-marketable investments in privately
held companies that were deemed to have had other than temporary
declines in value below their carrying value totaling $264,000,
for the year ended December31, 2001. There were no similar
write-downs for the years ending December31, 2003 or 2002. 72 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents During the third quarter of 2003, the Company
incurred facility exit costs totaling $585,000 related to the
cessation of use of leased premises. The charge was recorded to

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS Effective January1, 1999, the Company
adopted a defined contribution retirement plan under
Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers
substantially all employees. Eligible employees may contribute
amounts to the plan, via payroll withholding, subject to certain
limitations. The Company does not match contributions by plan
participants.   
13.
RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS During the years ended December31, 2001 and
2000, the Company provided loans to shareholders, who were also
officers, totaling $200,000 and $32million respectively.
The loan made during 2001 was repaid prior to December31,
2001. All remaining amounts outstanding were settled in 2002.
During the year ended December31, 2001 a charge to general
and administrative expense of $159,000 was recorded to adjust
the carrying value of the notes to the fair value of the
underlying collateral and to reflect certain other adjustments
with respect to such notes. During the year ended December 31,
2002, in connection with the note settlements the Company
recorded recoveries of amounts previously charged-off totaling
approximately $64,000. There were no related party transactions
for the year ended December31, 2003. Included in revenue are amounts from related
parties of $45million, $62 million and
$190million for the years ended December31, 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively. During 2003, the Company also
recorded $300,000 in other income related to professional
services provided to its Japanese joint venture.   
14.
LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS From time to time, the Company is subject to
legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business,
including claims of alleged infringement of patents, trademarks,
copyrights and other intellectual property rights, and a variety
of claims arising in connection with the services, such as
claims alleging defamation or invasion of privacy. On October25, 2001, a putative class action
lawsuit captioned Leonard Turroff, etal. vs Ask Jeeves,
Inc., etal. was filed against the Company and two of the
Companys officers and directors collectively the
Individual Defendants in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. Also named as
defendants were Morgan Stanley Co., Inc., FleetBoston
Robertson Stephens, Goldman Sachs Co.,
U.S.Bancorp Piper Jaffray, and Dain Rauscher, Inc., the
underwriters of the Companys initial public offering. The
complaint alleges violations of Section11 of the
Securities Act of 1933 against all defendants, and violations of
Section15 of the Securities Act against the Individual
Defendants in connection with the Companys initial public
offering IPO. An amended complaint 73 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents was filed on December6, 2001, which
includes the same allegations in connection with Ask
Jeeves secondary offering in March 2000. The complaints
seek unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of
purchasers of common stock between June30, 1999 and
December6, 2000. The Company believes the claims are
without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously. On
June24, 2003, a special committee of our board of
directors approved the settlement of this action, subject to
certain conditions including that a sufficient number of the
defendants participate in the settlement, and on July9,
2003, the Individual Defendants approved the settlement of this
action. It is anticipated that the settlement will be submitted
to the Court for approval in the near future. On May2, 2002, a stockholder derivative
lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of
Alameda, titled Brennerv. Strauch etal. The lawsuit
purported to be filed on behalf of the Company, asserting claims
against the officers and directors at the time of the
Companys IPO. Also named as defendants were Morgan
Stanley Co., Inc., and FleetBoston Robertson
Stephens, the underwriters of the Companys IPO. The
complaint alleged breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, an
unjust enrichment of the named officers and directors, for
acquiescing and/or conspiring with the underwriter defendants in
underpricing the IPO. On October31, 2002, the Court
dismissed the lawsuit, with prejudice. The plaintiff appealed
and the case was consolidated with similar derivative actions.
On June19, 2003, the plaintiffs stipulated to dismissal of
the appeal. On January27, 2004, a lawsuit was filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York captioned American Blind and Wallpaper, Inc.v.
Google, Inc., etal., in which Ask Jeeves, Inc., America
Online, Inc., Netscape Communications Corporation, Compuserve
Interactive Services, Inc., and Earthlink, Inc. were also named
as defendants. On February27, 2004, the Company was served
with an Amended Complaint in the matter. The Complaint alleges
trademark infringement, false representation, and dilution under
the Lanham Act and other claims arising from defendants
alleged unlawful use of plaintiffs trademarks.
Plaintiffs claims are based on the allegations that
defendants sell keywords identical to plaintiffs marks to
various third parties and by manipulating search results,
consumers are unwittingly diverted to competitors products
and services. The plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and an
unspecified amount of damages. The Company has tendered this
suit to Google for indemnification pursuant to the terms of the
Advertising Services Agreement, dated July17, 2002,
between Ask Jeeves and Google. In managements opinion, resolution of these
matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the
Companys results of operation, cash flows or financial
position. However, depending on the amount and timing, an
unfavorable resolution of these matters could materially and
adversely affect the Companys future results of
operations, cash flows or financial position in a future period. Indemnifications While the Company has various guarantees included
in contracts in the normal course of business, primarily in the
form of indemnities, these guarantees do not represent
significant commitments or contingent liabilities. Accordingly,
the Company has not recorded a liability related to
indemnification provisions.

If the Company had reported net income for the
years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, the calculation of
historical diluted earnings per share would have included an
additional 1,480,922 and 1,408,338 common equivalent shares
related to the outstanding stock options and warrants not
included above determined using the treasury stock method. For
the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, a total
of 1,383,205, 4,597,853 and 6,291,056 common equivalent shares
related to outstanding stock options and warrants determined
using the treasury stock method have been excluded from the
calculation of historical diluted earnings per share as their
respective exercise prices were more than the average market
value for the respective periods. 17.DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS On May28, 2003, the Company entered into an
agreement to sell certain assets used in the Jeeves Solutions
division to Kanisa Inc. Kanisa. The sale of such
assets closed on July1, 2003 at which time the Company
ceased offering Jeeves Solutions products and services to
corporate customers. The 75 Ask Jeeves, Inc. Table of Contents assets sold included, among other things,
tangible personal property, intellectual property and customer
and business contracts. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company
recorded a gain of approximately $25million, net of
estimated income taxes of $109,000, representing the excess of
the purchase consideration received at closing over the book
value of the assets sold, as well as the remaining amount of
deferred license fees applicable to Jeeves Solutions. In
exchange for the sale of such assets, the Company received
$34million in cash at the closing and a promissory note
for up to $750,000, which is payable one year from the date of
closing. The amount payable under the note is currently expected
to be approximately $731,000, subject to certain upward or
downward adjustments, but in no event shall the amount payable
under the note exceed $750,000. The proceeds, if any, from the
promissory note will be recorded as additional gain on the
transaction upon receipt. Total revenues related to the discontinued
operations were $42million, $91million and
$150million for the years ended December31, 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively. The assets and liabilities of
Jeeves Solutions have been classified as assets and liabilities
of discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheets and the results of operations have been reclassified as
loss from discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Operations for all dates and periods presented.

CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15e
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the
end of the period covered by this report, which we refer to as
the Evaluation Date. Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the
Evaluation Date such that the information relating to Ask
Jeeves, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed in our SEC reports   
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and
is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.
During the year ended December31, 2003, no
change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred
that, in our judgment, either materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. PARTIII
