Item 8 hereof, for financial information about the Company
foreign and domestic operations and export sales required by this Item.
The Company uses a process of integrated lead qualification and sales
demonstration. Once a customer opportunity is identified, the Company employs a
team-based sales approach involving inside and outside sales personnel who are
supported by application engineers.
The Company employs a variety of marketing techniques, including direct
mail, trade shows, and advertising in trade journals, and proactively seeks
publicity opportunities for customer testimonials. Management believes that
word-of-mouth advertising from the Company existing customers provides an
important marketing advantage. The Company also uses a computerized sales and
marketing software system with telemarketing, lead tracking and analysis, as
well as customer support capabilities. Finally, the Company utilizes its state-
of-the-art web site to promote its product offerings. Each of the Company
sales offices is linked electronically to the Company headquarters.
In June 1996, the Company entered into an Original Equipment Manufacturer
OEM agreement with Mitutoyo Corporation Mitutoyo, a Japanese company that
is the world largest manufacturer of metrology tools. Mitutoyo markets the
FAROArmR in Japan under the name SPINARMR. The agreement, which grants
Mitutoyo non-exclusive distribution right in Japan, expires in June 2001 and is
renewable for successive one-year terms.
In March 1999, the Company entered into an OEM agreement with Brown & Sharpe
Manufacturing Company Brown & Sharpe, a North Kingstown, Rhode Island
company that is a world leader in the manufacture of traditional CMMs and other
metrology products. Brown & Sharpe markets the FAROArmR worldwide under the
name GAGE 2000 A. The agreement, which grants Brown & Sharpe non-exclusive
distribution right worldwide, expires in March 2002, and is renewable for
successive one-year terms.
Research and Development
The Company believes that its future success depends on its ability to
achieve technological leadership, which will require ongoing enhancements of
its products and the development of new applications and products that provide
3-D measurement solutions. Accordingly, the Company intends to continue to make
substantial investments in the development of new technologies, the
commercialization of new products that build on the Company existing
technological base and the enhancement and development of additional
applications for its products.
6  The Company research and development efforts are directed primarily at
enhancing the functional adaptability of its current products and developing
new and innovative products that respond to specific requirements of the
emerging market for 3-D measurement systems. The Company research and
development efforts have been devoted primarily to mechanical hardware,
electronics and software. The Company engineering development efforts will
continue to focus on the FAROArmR and the family of CAM2 products.
Significant efforts are also being directed toward the development of new
Control Station measurement technologies and additional features for existing
products. See Technology.
At December 31, 2000, the Company employed 37 scientists and technicians in
its research and development efforts. Research and development expenses were
approximately $36 million in 2000 as compared to $38 million in 1999 and $26
million in 1998. Research and development activities, especially with respect
to new products and technologies, are subject to significant risks, and there
can be no assurance that any of the Company research and development
activities will be completed successfully or on schedule, or, if so completed,
will be commercially accepted.
Technology
The primary measurement function of the FAROArmR and The Control Station
is to provide orientation and position information with respect to the probe at
the end of the FAROArmR. This information is processed by software and can be
compared to the desired dimensions contained in the CAD data of a production
part or assembly to determine whether the measured data conforms to such
dimensional specifications.
To accomplish this measurement function, the FAROArmR and The Control
Station is designed as an articulated arm with six or seven joints. The arm
consists of aluminum links and rotating joints that are combined in different
lengths and configurations, resulting in human arm-like characteristics. Each
joint is instrumented with a rotational transducer, a device used to measure
rotation, which is based on optical digital technology. The position and
orientation of the probe in three dimensions is determined by applying
trigonometric calculations at each joint. The position of the end of a link of
the arm can be determined by using the angle measured and the known length of
the link. Through a complex summation of these calculations at each joint, the
position and orientation of the probe is determined.
The Company products are the result of a successful integration of state-
of-the-art developments in mechanical and electronic hardware and applications
software. The unique nature of the Company technical developments is
evidenced by the Company numerous U.S. and international patents. The Company
maintains low cost product design processes by retaining development
responsibilities for all electronics, hardware and software.
Mechanical Hardware. The FAROArmR is designed to function in diverse
environments and under rigorous physical conditions. The arm monitors its
temperature to adjust for environments ranging from -10 degrees to +50 degrees
Celsius. The arm is constructed of pre-stressed precision bearings to resist
shock loads. Low production costs are attained by the proprietary combination
of reasonably priced electromechanical components accompanied by the
optimization and on-board storage of calibration data. Many of the Company
innovations relate to the environmental adaptability of its products.
Significant features include integrated counter-balancing, configuration
convertibility and temperature compensation.
Electronics. An on-board computer that is designed to handle complex
analyses of joint data as well as communications with a variety of host
computers processes the rotational information
7 for each joint. The Company electronics are based on digital signal
processing and surface mount technologies. The Company products meet all
mandatory electronic safety requirements. Advanced circuit board development,
surface mount production and automated testing methods are used to ensure low
cost and high reliability.
Software. CAM2 is a Windows-based, 32-bit application family written for the
most recent PC-based technology. CAM2 has been entirely designed and programmed
by the Company utilizing field input and industry wide beta site installations.
CAM2 CAD analyserR is a family member for viewing, analyzing and browsing CAD
files. CAM2 DesignR is a family member primarily used for reverse engineering
and is written as an AutoCAD runtime extension ARX that is the AutoCAD
Application Programming Interface API. Family member CAM2 MeasureR is a
simplified version of Design for pure measurement applications written entirely
on the ACIS CAD development platform. Family member CAM2 AutomotiveR is a
measurement software designed for large CAD files and specific Automotive
applications and is written using a proprietary graphics display engine. Family
member CAM2 SPC ProcessR is designed for plant wide dimensional data
acquisition and presentation in classical SPC Statistical Process Control
formats for plant-wide quality control.
All the CAM2 family members are written in the C++ development language
using Microsoft Foundation Class MFC standards. The software fully implements
UNICODE standards for worldwide translation allowing the Company to create
foreign language versions to enter international markets more effectively. The
software is developed with the cooperation of diverse user beta sites and a
well-developed system for tracking and implementing market demands. The
Company software products are available in seven 7 languages worldwide.
Intellectual Property
The Company holds or has pending 29 patents in the United States, 17 of
which are also held or pending in other jurisdictions. The Company also has 13
registered trademarks in the United States, 25 foreign registered trademarks, 8
trademark applications pending in the United States and
3 foreign trademark applications pending. The Company also has internet domain
names registered worldwide.
The Company relies on a combination of contractual provisions and trade
secret laws to protect its proprietary information. There can be no assurance
that the steps taken by the Company to protect its trade secrets and
proprietary information will be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of its
proprietary information or to preclude third-party development of similar
intellectual property.
Despite the Company efforts to protect its proprietary rights,
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the Company products or
to obtain and use information that the Company regards as proprietary. The
Company intends to vigorously defend its proprietary rights against
infringement by third parties. However, policing unauthorized use of the
Company products is difficult, particularly overseas, and the Company is
unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists.
In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the Company
proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
The Company does not believe that any of its products infringe on the
proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that
third parties will not claim infringement by the Company with respect to
current or future products. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be
time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or
require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty
or licensing agreements, if required, may not
8 be available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all, which could have a
material adverse effect upon the Company business, operating results and
financial condition.
Manufacturing and Assembly
The Company manufactures its products primarily at its headquarters in Lake
Mary, Florida. Manufacturing consists primarily of assembling components and
subassemblies purchased from suppliers into finished products. The primary
components, which include machined parts and electronic circuit boards, are
produced by subcontractors according to the Company specifications. All
products are assembled, calibrated and tested for accuracy and functionality
before shipment. In limited circumstances, the Company performs in-house
circuit board assembly and part machining.
Quality has rapidly emerged as a new emphasis in commerce and industry,
and is a significant factor in international trade. The Company
manufacturing, engineering and design headquarters have been registered to the
ISO 9001 standard since July 1998. Yearly semi-annual surveillance audits have
documented continuous improvement to this multinational standard. The Company
continues to examine its scope of registration as the business evolves and has
chosen English as the standard business language for its operations. This
decision is expected to significantly influence the Company operations and
documentation globally. This has been done in concert with the ISO Standard
Registrar, and is expected to increase customer confidence in the Company
products and services worldwide.
In May 2000, the Company received Accreditation to ISO/IEC Guide 25, which
is a standard for Calibration and Testing Laboratories. The Company Scope of
Supply for this accreditation is: Calibration and Certification of Measuring
and Test Equipment.
Competition
The broad market for measurement devices, which include hand-measurement
tools, test fixtures and conventional, fixed-base CMMs, is highly competitive.
Manufacturers of hand-measurement tools and traditional CMMs include a
significant number of well-established companies that are substantially larger
and possess substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources
than the Company. There can be no assurance that these entities or others will
not succeed in developing products or technologies that will directly compete
with those of the Company. The market for measurement software to retrofit
traditional CMMs, and for statistical process control is also highly
competitive. The Company will be required to make continued investments in
technology and product development to maintain its technological advantage over
its competition. There can be no assurance that the Company will have
sufficient resources to make such investments or that the Company product
development efforts will be sufficient to allow the Company to compete
successfully as the industry evolves. The Company products compete on the
basis of portability, accuracy, application features, ease-of-use, quality,
price and technical support.
The Company significant direct competitors for its FAROArmR and related
software are Romer SRL France and Romer, Inc., a Cimcore Company
California. Prior to 2000 these two companies were a joint venture. The
Company is aware of a direct competitor in Germany, two direct competitors in
Italy, and a direct competitor in the United Kingdom, each of which the Company
believes currently has significantly less sales volume than the Company. The
Company also has an established, competitor in Japan that markets a portable
measuring device. There can be no assurance that such companies will not devote
additional resources to the development and marketing of products that compete
with those of the Company.
9  The worldwide trend toward CAD-based factory floor metrology has resulted in
the introduction of CAD-based inspection software and statistical process
control for conventional CMMs by most of the large CMM manufacturers. Certain
CMM manufacturers are miniaturizing, and in some cases increasing the mobility
of, their conventional CMMs. Nonetheless, these CMMs still have small
measurement volumes, lack the adaptability typical of portable, articulated arm
measurement devices and lose accuracy outside the controlled environment of the
metrology lab.
Backlog
At December 31, 2000, the Company had orders representing approximately $10
million in product sales outstanding. The majority of such orders were shipped
by March 20, 2001. Additionally, the Company had orders representing
approximately $13 million in warranty, training and service sales outstanding
at December 31, 2000.
Employees
At December 31, 2000, the Company had 232 full-time employees, consisting of
101 sales/application-engineering professionals, 37 production staff, 37
research and development staff, 40 administrative staff, and 17 customer
service specialists. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining
agreements. The Company believes its employee relations are good. Management
believes that its future growth and success will depend in part on its ability
to retain and continue to attract highly skilled personnel. The Company
anticipates that it will obtain the additional personnel required to satisfy
its staffing requirements for the foreseeable future.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following information should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, including the notes thereto,
included elsewhere in this document.
Overview
The Company designs, develops, markets and supports portable, software-
driven, 3-D measurement systems that are used in a broad range of manufacturing
and industrial applications. The Company principal products are the
FAROArmR articulated measuring device, the Control Station and its multi-
faceted CAM2 software which provides for CAD-based inspection on portable and
fixed-base CMMs, and factory-level statistical process control. Together, these
products integrate the measurement and quality inspection function with CAD,
CAM and computer-aided engineering CAE technology to improve productivity,
enhance product quality and decrease rework and scrap in the manufacturing
process. The Company products bring precision measurement, quality inspection
and specification conformance capabilities, integrated with leading CAD
software, to the factory floor. The Company is a pioneer in the development and
marketing of 3-D measurement
13 technology in manufacturing and industrial applications and currently holds or
has pending 29 patents in the United States, 17 of which also are held or
pending in other jurisdictions. The Company products have been purchased by
more than 2,300 customers worldwide, ranging from small machine shops to such
large manufacturing and industrial companies as Audi, Boeing, British
Aerospace, Caterpillar, DaimlerChrysler, General Electric, General Motors,
Honda, Johnson Controls, Komatsu Dresser, Lockheed Martin, Siemens and
Volkswagen.
From its inception in 1982 through 1992, the Company focused on providing
computerized, 3-D measurement devices to the orthopedic and neurosurgical
markets. During this period, the company introduced a knee laxity measurement
device, a diagnostic tool for measuring posture, scoliosis
and back flexibility, and a surgical guidance device utilizing a six-axis
articulated arm.
In 1992, in an effort to capitalize on a demand for 3-D portable measurement
tools for the factory floor, the Company made a strategic decision to target
its core measurement technology to the manufacturing and industrial markets. In
order to focus on manufacturing and industrial applications of its technology,
the Company phased out the direct sale of its medical products and entered into
licensing agreements with two major neurosurgical companies for its medical
technology. In 1995, the Company made a strategic decision to target
international markets. The Company established sales offices in France and
Germany in 1996, Great Britain in 1997 and Japan and Spain in 2000.
International sales represented 506%, 466% and 464% of sales in 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively.
The Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of the FAROArmR, its
six-axis articulated measuring device, and its multi-faceted CAM2 software.
Revenue related to the Company 3-D measurement equipment and related software
is recognized upon shipment as the Company considers the earnings process
substantially complete as of the shipping date. Revenue from sales of software
only is recognized when no further significant production, modification or
customization of the software is required and where the following criteria are
met: persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists, delivery has occurred,
and the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectible. Revenues
resulting from sales of comprehensive support, training and technology
consulting services are recognized as such services are performed. Extended
maintenance plan revenues are recognized in proportion to maintenance costs
projected to be incurred. The Company warrants its products against defects in
design, materials and workmanship for one year. A provision for estimated
future costs relating to warranty expenses is recorded when products are
shipped. Costs relating to extended maintenance plans are recognized as
incurred.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 summarizing its views of applying generally
accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements.
The Company policy of revenue recognition is consistent with this bulletin.
Revenue growth has resulted from increased unit sales due to an expanded
sales effort that included the addition of sales personnel at existing offices,
the opening of new sales offices and expanded promotional efforts which include
a multilingual web site and Company demo CD. In 2000 the Company introduced The
Control Station with SoftCheck Tools, new accessory items such as The FARO
Rail, the FARO Powerhouse and new versions of all the members of the CAM2
software family.
In addition to providing a one-year basic warranty without additional
charge, the Company offers its customers one, two and three-year extended
maintenance contracts, which include on-line help
14 services, software upgrades and hardware warranties. In addition, the Company
sells training and technology consulting services relating to its products.
Cost of sales consists primarily of material, production overhead and labor.
Selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions to sales and
marketing personnel, and promotion, advertising, travel and telecommunications.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for
administrative personnel, rent, utilities and professional and legal expenses.
Research and development expenses represent salaries, equipment and third-party
services.
Accounting for wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is maintained in the
currency of the respective foreign jurisdiction and, therefore, fluctuations in
exchange rates may have an impact on intercompany accounts reflected in the
Company consolidated financial statements. Although the Company has not
historically engaged in any hedging transactions to limit risks of currency
fluctuations, it intends to do so in the future.

Sales. Sales increased $73 million, or 222%, from $331 million in 1999 to
$405 million in 2000. The increase resulted from increases in the U.S. $23
million, or 131%, from $177 million to $200 million, Europe $35 million,
or 328%, from $106 million to $141 million and the remainder of the world
an increase of $16 million, or 323%, from $48 million to $64 million. The
increase primarily resulted from higher product unit sales in all geographic
regions, partially offset by the effect of the stronger U.S. Dollar in 2000
approximately $18 million.                    15  Gross profit. Gross profit increased by $68 million, or 357%, from $189
million in 1999 to $257 million in 2000. Gross margin increased to 635% in
2000 from 572% in 1999. The increase in gross margin was primarily a result of
cost reductions for computer hardware and software products in 2000, partially
offset by the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Selling expenses. Selling expenses increased $19 million, or 156%, from
$121 million in 1999 to $140 million in 2000. This increase was primarily a
result of higher selling expenses in the United States $11 million and in
Europe $12 million, principally as a result of higher compensation and
marketing expenses, offset in part by the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar in
2000 approximately $550,000.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses
increased by $8 million, or 159%, from $50 million in 1999 to $58 million
in 2000. The increase was due to increases across many categories in the U.S.
$07 million and in Europe $01 million, offset in part by the effect of
the stronger U.S. dollar in 2000 approximately $150,000.

expenses decreased by $15 million, or 344%, from $45 million in 1999 to $29
million in 2000. The decrease primarily resulted from the $31 million
impairment loss on acquired intangible assets at the end of 1999, which reduced
the amount of acquired intangible assets to be amortized, offset in part by
depreciation on assets acquired in 2000.
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses
decreased by $300,000, or 73%, from $38 million in 1999 to $35 million in
2000. The decrease was due to decreases across many expense categories in the
United States $02 million, and to the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar in
2000 $01 million on European expenses, offset in part by increase, in local
currency, across many categories in Europe $01 million.
Employee stock option expenses. Employee stock option expenses decreased by
$46,000, or 269%, from $169,000 in 1999 to $123,000 in 2000. This decrease was
a result of a reduction in the amortized deferred compensation expense related
to stock options issued in 1995 and 1997. For all options issued in 2000 and
1999, no compensation expense was recorded, as the exercise price of the
options was equal to the market price on the day of the grant.
Impairment loss on acquired intangible assets. An unusual impairment loss of
$31 million was recorded in 1999 to reflect an impairment of the intangible
assets resulting from the German acquisition on May 15, 1998. The impairment
resulted from the Company revised forecast of the cash flows expected from
the developed and core technology acquired with the German acquisition.
Interest income. Interest income increased by $144,000, from $716,000 in
1999 to $860,000 in 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to higher
average yields of interest-earning cash, cash equivalents, and investments held
and higher average principal amounts invested in 2000 see Liquidity and
Capital Resources below.
Other income. Other income decreased by $173,000, from $475,000 in 1999 to
$302,000 in 2000. The decrease resulted principally from foreign exchange
losses in 2000.
Income tax expense benefit. Income tax expense benefit increased by $15
million, from a benefit of $11 million in 1999 to expense of $04 million in
2000. The tax expense resulted from the Company U.S. operation taxable
earnings in 2000. A German federal tax benefit of $65 million
16 was offset in 2000 against a valuation allowance related to the German
acquisition of 1998. At December 31, 2000, the Company foreign subsidiaries
had deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards, which do
not expire, and intangible assets of $34 million and $31 million,
respectively.
Net income loss. The Company net income loss increased by $74
million, from a loss of $74 million in 1999 to net income of $40,000 in 2000
due to the factors mentioned above.
1999 Compared to 1998
Sales. Sales increased $56 million, or 204%, from $275 million in 1998 to
$331 million in 1999. The increase resulted from increases in the U.S. $30
million, or 204%, from $147 million to $177 million, Europe $21 million,
or 247%, from $85 million to $106 million and the remainder of the world
an increase of $05 million, or 116%, from $43 million to $48 million.
Gross profit. Gross profit increased by $27 million, or 167%, from $162
million in 1998 to $189 million in 1999. The increase resulted from the
increase in sales, partially offset by unusual charges of $06 million related
to excess and obsolete inventory $05 million and warranties $01 million.
Excluding the unusual charges, gross profit was $195 million, or 589%, the
same gross margin percentage as 1998.
Selling expenses. Selling expenses increased $21 million, or 210%, from
$100 million in 1998 to $121 million in 1999. The increase primarily resulted
from selling expenses in Germany, which increased by $14 million, with a full
year of expenses in 1999 from the German acquisition, compared to seven and a
half months in 1998, and an increase in the number of sales and marketing
employees in Europe. Selling expenses also increased by $04 million, resulting
from an unusual write-down of demonstration inventory, which was identified
during a thorough worldwide physical inventory. U.S. salaries, commissions,
advertising and trade shows also increased and were partially offset by lower
spending on other promotions.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses
increased by $18 million, or 563%, from $32 million in 1998 to $50 million
in 1999. The increase primarily resulted from general and administrative
expenses in Germany, which increased by $11 million, with a full year of
expenses in 1999 compared to seven and a half months in 1998. General and
administrative expenses also increased due to higher salaries, outside
services, and professional and legal expenses, and unusual third quarter
charges $02 million, primarily for write-offs of doubtful accounts and
residual costs related to the German acquisition, partially offset by lower
bonuses and a $01 million unusual adjustments.
Depreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization
expenses increased by $17 million, or 607%, from $28 million in 1998 to $45
million in 1999. The increase primarily resulted from $10 million of unusual
expenses $07 million of amortization of software development costs, $02
million of depreciation of property and equipment and $01 million of
amortization of patents with no remaining economic value. These unusual
expenses resulted from a review of the Company assets, which determined that
certain patents and capitalized research and development costs should be
written off due to changes in technology. Additionally, a full year of
amortization of the intangible assets resulting from the German acquisition
increased amortization expense in 1999 by $03 million.
Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses
increased by $12 million, or 462%, from $26 million in 1998 to $38 million
in 1999. The increase primarily
17 resulted from an increase in the number of U.S. research and development
employees $06 million, a full year of research and development expenses in
Germany in 1999, compared to seven and a half months of expenses in 1998 $04
million, and an unusual charge $02 million to write off capitalized
research and development costs for products no longer sold by the Company.
Employee stock option expenses. Employee stock option expenses decreased by
$3,000, or 17%, from $172,000 in 1998 to $169,000 in 1999. This decrease was a
result of a reduction in the amortized deferred compensation expense related to
stock options issued in 1995 and 1997. For all options issued in 1999, no
compensation expense was recorded, as the exercise price of the options was
equal to the market price on the day of the grant.
Impairment loss on acquired intangible assets. A unusual impairment loss of
$31 million was recorded in 1999 to reflect an impairment of the intangible
assets resulting from the German acquisition on May 15, 1998. The impairment
resulted from the Company revised forecast of the cash flows expected from
the developed and core technology acquired with the German acquisition.
Other income. Other income increased by $04 million, or 4000%, from $01
million in 1998 to $05 million in 1999. The increase resulted principally from
an increase in royalty income and from an increase in licensing fees for the
Company medical technologies in 1999.
Interest income. Interest income decreased by $04 million, or 364%, from
$11 million in 1998 to $07 million in 1999. The decrease primarily resulted
from a reduction in the Company cash invested after the acquisition of the
German company, which reduced the Company cash invested for twelve months in
1999, but only seven and a half months in 1998. In addition, more cash was
invested in lower-yielding tax exempt municipal bonds during 1999.
Income tax benefit expense. Income tax benefit increased by $16 million,
from a $05 million expense in 1998 to a $11 million benefit in 1999. The
benefit resulted from the Company U.S. operation taxable loss. The deferred
tax benefit on the Company foreign loss, including the impairment loss, was
offset by a $31 million valuation allowance.
Net loss. The Company net loss increased by $25 million, or 510%, from
$49 million in 1998 to $74 million in 1999. The increase resulted primarily
from the unusual impairment loss on acquired intangible assets $31 million,
with no offsetting tax benefit on the intangible assets resulting from the
acquisition in Germany. Other unusual operating charges $23 million and
higher recurring general and administrative and research and development
expenses as a percentage of sales also contributed to the higher net loss,
partially offset by a $16 million increase in the income tax benefit. The net
loss includes $25 million of amortization of intangibles related to the German
acquisition, an increase of $03 million from 1998.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
In September 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering of
Common Stock that provided net proceeds of $317 million. Total marketable
securities cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and investments
at December 31, 2000 were $190 million, compared to $167 million at December
31, 1999.
For the year ended December 31, 2000, net cash provided by operating
activities was $47 million compared to $14 million in 1999. Net cash provided
by operating activities, net of foreign exchange effects, increased primarily
due to improved operational results in 2000.                    18  Net cash excluding short-term investments and investments used in
investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $31 million,
compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $53 million in 1999.
Net cash used in investing activities in 2000 was primarily due to net increase
in short-term investments and investments in 2000 of $732,000, increases in
notes receivable of $10 million see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in Item 8 herein and purchases of property and equipment
of $12 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31,
2000 was $11,000, compared to net cash used of $282,000 in 1999. The Company
invests excess cash balances in short-term investment grade securities, such as
money market investments, obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies,
and obligations of state and local government agencies.
Currency exchange rate changes resulted in a $161,000 reduction on the
Company reported cash at December 31, 2000.
The Company principal commitments at December 31, 2000 consisted of leases
on its headquarters and regional and sales offices. There were no material
commitments for capital expenditures at that date. The Company believes that
its cash, investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to
satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure needs at least through
2001.
Foreign Exchange Exposure
Sales outside the United States represent a significant portion of the
Company total revenues. At present, the majority of the Company revenues
and expenses are invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars. In the future, the Company
expects a greater portion of its revenues to be denominated in foreign
currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and such
foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the Company
business, results of operations and financial condition, and could specifically
result in foreign exchange losses. The impact of future exchange rate
fluctuations on the results of the Company operations cannot be accurately
predicted. To the extent that the percentage of the Company non-U.S. dollar
revenues derived from international sales increases in the future, the
Company exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates will increase. Historically, the Company has not hedged against the risks
associated with fluctuations in exchange rates. The Company at present is
evaluating its exposure, and may use foreign exchange contracts and/or foreign
currency options to hedge these risks in the future.
Inflation
The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its
results of operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a
material impact on its operations in 2001.
Conversion to the Euro Currency
On January 1, 1999, certain member countries of the European Union
established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the
European Union common currency Euro. The transition period for the
introduction of the Euro ends June 30, 2002. After the transition period
certain member countries of the European Union are expected to adopt the Euro
as their national currency. Issues facing the Company as a result of the
introduction of the Euro include converting information technology systems,
reassessing currency risk, amending lease agreements and other contracts, and processing tax and accounting records. The Company is
addressing these issues and does not expect the Euro to have a material effect
on the Company financial condition or results of operations.
Implementation of SAB 101
The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, in December
1999. The SAB summarizes certain of the SEC staff views in applying generally
accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements.
During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company performed a comprehensive review
of its revenue recognition policies and determined that it is in compliance
with SAB 101.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business--FARO Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries develops,
manufactures, markets and supports Computer Aided Design CAD-based quality
assurance products and CAD-based inspection and statistical process control
software. The Company has four wholly-owned subsidiaries FARO FSC, Ltd.; FARO
Europe GmbH & Co. KG, a German company, FARO Japan KKK, a Japanese company, and
Antares LDA, a Portuguese company.
Principles of Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of FARO Technologies, Inc. and all wholly-owned subsidiaries
collectively, the Company. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated. The financial statements of the foreign
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at
period end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each
reporting period for results of operations. Adjustments resulting from
translation of financial statements are reflected as a separate component of
comprehensive loss.
Revenue Recognition, Product Warranty and Extended Maintenance Contracts Revenue related to the Company 3-D measurement equipment and related software
is recognized upon shipment as the Company considers the earnings process
substantially complete as of the shipping date. Revenue from sales of software
only is recognized when no further significant production, modification or
customization of the software is required and where the following criteria are
met: persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists, delivery has occurred,
and the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectible. Revenues
resulting from sales of comprehensive support, training and technology
consulting services are recognized as such services are performed. Extended
maintenance plan revenues are recognized in proportion to maintenance costs
projected to be incurred. The Company warrants its products against defects in
design, materials and workmanship for one year. A provision for estimated
future costs relating to warranty expenses is recorded when products are
shipped. Costs relating to extended maintenance plans are recognized as
incurred.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 summarizing its views of applying generally
accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements.
The Company policy of revenue recognition is consistent with this bulletin.
Cash and Cash Equivalents--The Company considers cash on hand and amounts on
deposit with financial institutions which have original maturities of three
months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
All short-term investments in debt securities which have maturities of three
months or less are classified as trading securities, which are carried at
market value based upon the quoted market prices of those investments at the
respective balance sheet date. Accordingly, net realized and unrealized gains
and losses on trading securities are included in other income in the
consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2000, cash and cash
equivalents consisted only of cash on hand and overnight investments. The gross
unrealized gain or loss on all trading securities was an unrealized loss of
approximately $18,000 in 1999 and an unrealized gain of approximately $3,000 in
1998.
26           FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Investments--Short-term investments ordinarily consist of short-term debt
securities acquired with cash not immediately needed in operations. At December
31, 2000 and 1999, such amounts consisted of government agency securities with
maturities not exceeding one year. Investments ordinarily consist of debt
securities acquired with cash not immediately needed in operations. Such
amounts have maturities of at least one year none have maturities exceeding
two years.
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, investments consisted of the following                                2000    1999
Government agency  $ 898,840 $3,747,694
Certificates of   240,309      Corporate  3,616,423                                                                 $4,755,572 $3,747,694
Management determines the appropriate classification of its short term
investments and investments in debt securities at the time of the purchase and
reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date. All investments in
debt securities are classified as held to maturity as the company has the
positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held to
maturity securities are stated at amortized cost. The amortized cost of debt
securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
to maturity. Such amortization and interest are included in other income in the
consolidated statements of operations. The Company investments in debt
securities are diversified among high credit quality securities in accordance
with the Company investment policy. The gross unrealized gain or loss on all
held to maturity debt securities was an unrealized gain of approximately
$65,000 at December 31, 2000, and unrealized loss of approximately $83,000 at
December 31, 1999.
Inventories--Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
In order to achieve a better matching of production costs with the revenues
generated in production, certain fixed overhead costs and certain general and
administrative costs that are related to production are capitalized into
inventory when they are incurred and are charged to cost of sales as product
costs at the time of sale.
Sales demonstration inventory is comprised of measuring devices utilized by
sales representatives to present the Company products to customers. These
products remain in sales demonstration inventory for six to twelve months and
are subsequently sold at prices that produce slightly reduced gross margins.
Property and Equipment--Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line and declining-balance methods
over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets as follows                                 
Machinery and  2 to 10 years
Furniture and  3 to 10 years  Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line basis over the
lesser of the life of the asset or the term of the lease.
27           FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Intangibles--Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair
value of businesses acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis over 5
years.
Other acquired intangibles principally include core technology, existing
product technology, workforce in place and customer relationships that arose in
connection with the acquisition of CATS. Other acquired intangibles are
recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized over their
estimated useful lives of primarily 3 to 5 years.
Product design costs incurred in the development of products after
technological feasibility is attained are capitalized and amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the related products,
not to exceed 3 years. The Company considers technological feasibility to be
established when the Company has completed all planning, designing, coding and
testing activities that are necessary to establish design specifications
including function, features and technical performance requirements.
Capitalization of product design costs ceases and amortization of such costs
begins when the product is available for general release to customers.
Patents are recorded at cost. Amortization is computed using the straight-
line method over the lives of the patents, which is 17 years. Other intangibles
are amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 5 years.
Research and Development--Research and development costs incurred in the
discovery of new knowledge and the resulting translation of this new knowledge
into plans and designs for new products, prior to the attainment of the related
products' technological feasibility, are recorded as expenses in the period
incurred.
Income Taxes--Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income
tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments--The Company financial instruments
include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
investments, and accounts payable. The carrying amounts of such financial
instruments approximate their fair value due to the short term nature of such
instruments.
Earnings Per Share--Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing
earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential
dilution of securities that could share in the earnings. A reconciliation of
the number of common shares used in calculation of basic and diluted EPS is
presented in Note 13.
Concentration of Credit Risk--Financial instruments which potentially expose
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of operating
demand deposit accounts. The Company policy is to place its operating demand
deposit accounts with high credit quality financial institutions.
28           FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  In June 1996, the Company entered into an Original Equipment Manufacturer
OEM agreement with Mitutoyo Corporation Mitutoyo, a Japanese company
which manufactures and markets metrology tools. Under the agreement, Mitutoyo
sells the Company products under the name SPINARM. The agreement, which
grants Mitutoyo a nonexclusive right to sales in Japan, expired in June 2000
and was renewed for a successive one-year term in 2000.
In 1999, the Company entered into an OEM agreement with Brown & Sharpe
Manufacturing Company Brown & Sharpe, a North Kingstown, Rhode Island
company that is a world leader in the manufacture of traditional CMMs and other
metrology products. Brown & Sharpe will market the FAROArmR worldwide under
the name GAGE 2000 A. The agreement, which grants Brown & Sharpe non-exclusive
distribution right worldwide, expires in March 2002, and is renewable for
successive one-year terms.
No customer represented 10% or more of the Company total sales for the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.
Stock-Based Compensation--In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue to account
for its employee stock compensation plans under Accounting Principle Board
APB Opinion No. 25 with pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings
per share, as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in SFAS No.
123 has been applied. Under the intrinsic value based method, compensation cost
is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant
date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire
the stock. Under the fair value based method, compensation cost is measured at
the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the
service period, which is usually the vesting period.
Long-Lived Assets--Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and
certain intangible assets to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized if
expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets are less than
their carrying values. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair
value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to
be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell. See Note 2 regarding the impairment of certain developed and core
technology.
Estimates--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements--In June 2000, the FASB
issued Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Hedging Activities, which
amended Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. Statement No. 138 must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of
Statement 133. The Company adopted these new Statements effective January 1,
2001.
29           FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  These statements will require the Company to recognize all derivatives on
the balance sheet at fair value. The Company adoption of these Statements did
not have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial
position.
In April 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44 Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation, an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. Among other issues,
that interpretation clarifies the definition of employees for purposes of
applying Opinion No. 25, the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies
as a non-compensatory plan, the accounting consequence of various modifications
to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award and the accounting for
an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. This
interpretation is effective July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions in the
interpretation cover specific events that occur after either December 15, 1998,
or January 12, 2000. To the extent that this interpretation covers events
occurring during the period after December 31, 1998, or January 12, 2000, but
before the effective date of July 1, 2000, the effect of applying this
interpretation is recognized on a prospective basis from July 1, 2000. The
implementation of this interpretation does not have a material impact on the
Company financial statements.
Reclassifications--Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to current year financial statement presentation.
2. ACQUISITION OF CATS
In 1998, the Company acquired CATS GmbH for total consideration of $16
million including direct costs of the acquisition, consisting of $5 million
in cash, 916,668 shares of the Company Common Stock and the assumption of
certain outstanding liabilities of CATS. In addition, 333,332 shares of Common
Stock were placed in escrow to be issued provided CATS met certain performance
criteria within a specified timeframe. Subsequently, the escrow shares were re-
issued to the Company in February 2000 in accordance with the agreement.
The acquisition agreement provided that the Company provide a loan to each
of the two former shareholders of CATS to fund their tax liability in
connection with the Company acquisition of CATS. Such former CATS
shareholders remain key employees of the Company. On August 2, 1999, the
Company and each of the former CATS shareholders entered into a loan agreement
pursuant to which the Company agreed to loan to the former CATS shareholders an
amount equal to their German tax obligation in connection with the Company
acquisition of CATS. In June 2000, the German tax authorities issued a tax
assessment to each of the former CATS shareholders. In connection therewith, on
June 20, 2000 the Company and each of the former CATS shareholders entered into
an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and the Company granted loans to the
former CATS shareholders in the aggregate amount of $11 million the Loans.
The Loans are outstanding for a term of three years, at an interest rate of
approximately 43%, and grant the borrowers an option to extend the term for an
additional three years. As collateral for the Loans, the former CATS
shareholders pledged to the Company 177,074 shares of the Company Common
Stock. The Loans are a non-recourse obligation of the former CATS shareholders.                    30           FARO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
The acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting and the
final allocation among tangible and intangible assets and liabilities is as
follows                                 
Tangible assets including cash of $5,618. $ 1,522,000
Intangible assets:
Developed and core   8,940,000
Workforce in    550,000
Customer    590,000
2,871,000
In-process   3,210,000
Liabilities  1,614,000
$16,069,000
The valuation of CATS was based on management estimates of after tax net
cash flows and gives explicit consideration to the Security and Exchange
Commission SEC views on in-process research and development in purchase
transactions. In making the allocation of purchase price, the Company
considered the present value of cash flows and income, the status of projects,
completion costs and project risk. Specifically, the Company considered 1 the
value of core technology and ensured the relative allocations to core
technology and in-process technology were consistent with the relative
contributions of each of the final products and 2 the stage of completion of
the individual projects and ensured that the value considered only the efforts
completed as of the transaction date.
The amount allocated to in-process research and development of $32 million
was expensed upon acquisition, as it was determined that the underlying
projects had not reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future
use and successful future development was uncertain.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company recorded a write-down of
developed and core technology of approximately $31 million in the consolidated
statement of operations. This write-down was in accordance with SFAS No. 121,
Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No. 121. Developed
and core technology was determined to have been impaired because the
anticipated future cash flows resulting from the software products acquired
from CATS GmbH indicate that the recoverability of a portion of the developed
and core technology is not reasonably assured. The estimated fair value of the
developed and core technology was determined by calculating the present value
of the estimated future cash flows.
The operating results of CATS have been included in the consolidated
statements of operations since the date of acquisition. The following unaudited
pro forma results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1998 is
presented for informational purposes assuming that the Company had acquired
CATS as of January 1, 1998. The $32 million charge off for in-process research
and development has been excluded from the pro forma results as it represents a
material non-recurring charge.

The pro forma results of operations have been prepared for comparative
purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations
which actually would have resulted had the acquisition occurred on the date
indicated, or which may result in the future.

12. STOCK OPTION PLANS AND STOCK WARRANTS
The Company has three stock option plans that provide for the granting of
stock options to key employees and nonemployee members of the Board of
Directors. The 1993 Stock Option Plan 1993 Plan and the 1997 Employee Stock
Option Plan 1997 Plan provide for granting incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options to officers and key employees of the Company. The
Nonemployee Director Plan provides for granting nonqualified stock options and
formula options to nonemployee directors. Additionally, in connection with its
initial public offering in 1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase
100,000 shares of its Common Stock at $1320 per share. Such warrants expire in
2002.
The Company is authorized to grant options for up to 1,000,000 shares of
Common Stock under the 1993 Plan, of which 295,997 and 133,218 options have
been granted at exercise prices of $36 and $360, respectively. These options
vest primarily over 3 and 4 year periods.
The Company is authorized to grant options for up to 1,400,000 shares of
Common Stock under the 1997 Plan, of which 1,099,644 options have been granted
at exercise prices between $263 and $1430 for those meant to qualify for
treatment as incentive stock options. These options vest over a three-year
period.
The Company is authorized to grant up to 250,000 shares of Common Stock
under the Nonemployee Director Plan. Each nonemployee director is granted 3,000
options upon election to the Board of Directors formula options. Formula
options granted directors are generally granted upon the same terms and
conditions as options granted to officers and employees. These options vest
over a three-year period. Additionally in 1997, certain nonemployee directors
were granted options to purchase 160,000 of Common Stock in consideration for
their prior service on the Board of Directors. These options vested upon grant
at an exercise price of $12.
Additionally, the Company 1997 Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, which is
authorized to issue up to 250,000 shares of Common Stock, permits non-employee
directors to elect to receive directors' fees in the form of Common Stock
rather than cash. Common Stock issued in lieu of cash directors' fees is issued
at the end of the quarter in which the fees are earned, with the number of
shares being based on the fair market value of the Common Stock for the five
trading days immediately preceding the last business day of the quarter.
Compensation cost charged to operations associated with the Company stock
option plans was $123,404, $168,912, and $172,164, in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Compensation cost was based on the difference between the value
of the stock, at date of grant, and its exercise price multiplied by the number
of shares vested in each year.
