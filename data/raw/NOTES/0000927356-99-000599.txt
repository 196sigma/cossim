Independent Auditors' Report
The Board of Directors
Carrier Access Corporation  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Carrier Access Corporation
as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the related statements of operations,
stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Carrier Access Corporation as
of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1998, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

CARRIER ACCESS CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a. Business and Basis of Presentation--Carrier Access Corporation CAC or
the Company is a leading provider of Multi-service Digital Access MDA
equipment to competitive telecommunications carriers, including competitive
local exchange carriers, Internet service providers and wireless carriers. The
Company MDA equipment is used for the provisioning of enhanced voice and high-
speed data services by carriers to end users such as small and medium-sized
businesses and government and educational institutions. The Company sells its
products through distributors and directly to end user customers. The Company
operates in one business segment and substantially all of its sales and
operations are domestic.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
b. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available for Sale Cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid debt securities
with maturities or interest reset dates of three months or less at the time of
purchase.
Marketable securities available for sale represent U.S. Government Agency and
Corporate bonds with maturities of greater than three months and are recorded at
the lower of amortized cost or market value. At December 31, 1997 and 1998,
amortized cost approximates market value. Securities available for sale 
consisted of the following as of December 31                   Amortized Cost and Market Value          Interest Rates
1997           1998             1998
Medium Term Notes                --        $ 1,676,925       606% to 638%
Corporate Notes             $ 560,837        $ 5,942,743       715% to 800%
Municipal Bonds                 --        $12,257,327       500% to 750%
Other                  $1,955,357        $ 2,900,000        Variable
Total                  $2,516,194        $22,776,995
c. Inventory--Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market, using
standard costs, which approximate average cost. Costs includes freight, certain
warehousing costs and other allocable overhead.
d. Property and equipment--Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are
recorded at cost and are depreciated and amortized using the straight-line
method over useful lives ranging from three to thirty years or the lease term.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 1996,
1997 and 1998 totaled $114,687, $185,701, $470,359, respectively.
e. Revenue Recognition--Revenue from sales of products is recognized upon
shipment. Reserves for estimated sales returns through stock rotation are
recorded when sales are made to customers with the right of return and are
based on management estimate of expected returns and historical experience.
The Company provides limited price protection to its distributors, whereby
increases in prices are subject to a 60-day notice period before becoming
effective. In addition, the distributor is also entitled to receive a credit
for subsequent price decreases to the extent of unsold distributor inventory at
the time of the price decrease. The Company also provides its distributors with
limited stock rotation rights, whereby products may be returned for an equal
dollar amount of new or different equipment. Customers are limited to three
exchanges per year and an amount equal to 15% of purchases in the preceding four
month period. Neither of these rights affect the total sales price or payment
obligations of the customer. In addition, the customers' obligation to the
Company is not contingent upon the ultimate resale of the products. The Company
provides for the estimated impact of price protection and stock rotation rights
in its allowance for estimated returns based on historical experience and
management forecasts of price protection credits and returns.

g. Research and Development Costs--Research and development costs are charged
to operations as incurred.
h. Long-Lived Assets--The Company accounts for long-lived assets under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of SFAS 121, which requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is generally recognized when
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset
is less than its carrying value. Measurement of impairment loss is based on the
fair value of the asset, which is generally determined using valuation
techniques such as the discounted present value of expected future cash flows.
i. Income Taxes --The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes SFAS 109. Under the asset and liability method of SFAS 109, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is required to the extent
any deferred tax assets may not be realizable.
j.  Income Loss Per Share, Common Stock Split and Re-Incorporation--Income
loss per share is presented in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS 128. SFAS 128
requires the presentation of basic and diluted EPS. Under SFAS 128, basic EPS
excludes dilution for potential common shares and is computed by dividing income
or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock
were exercised or converted and resulted in the issuance of common stock. In
1997 and 1998, diluted income per share includes the impact of common stock
options and excludes the impact of redeemable preferred stock, as the effect of
the assumed conversion of the preferred stock and the elimination of the related
dividend requirement would be antidilutive. Due to the loss in 1996, potential
common stock instruments were antidilutive.
On May 28, 1998 the Company Board of Directors approved a three-for-two
forward split of the Company Common Stock. In addition, the Board also
approved re-incorporation as a Delaware corporation, which included an increase
to 60 million authorized common shares and a change to a par value of $001 per
share. All share and per share information included in the accompanying
financial statements and notes thereto have been restated for the stock split.
k. Stock-Based Compensation--The Company accounts for its stock-based employee
compensation plan using the intrinsic value based method prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25, and related interpretations. As such, compensation expense
is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the
underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. The Company has provided pro forma
disclosures of net income loss and income loss per share, as if the fair
value based method of accounting for the plan, as prescribed by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123, had been applied.
Stock options issued to consultants and others for services are recorded at
fair value as prescribed by SFAS 123. Charges to operations associated with
these option grants were not significant during the years ended December 31,
1996, 1997 and 1998.
l. Warranty Costs--The Company provides limited warranty protection to
customers for a period of up to five years from the date of sale for parts and
labor. The Company has accrued for its warranty obligations based on historical
experience and management estimate of future warranty costs to be incurred.
m. Reclassifications--Certain reclassifications have been made to conform
prior year financial statements to the 1998 presentation.

6. Redeemable Preferred Stock And Initial Public Offering
During 1995, the Company authorized a new class of preferred stock, consisting
of 5,000,000 convertible Series A preferred shares with a par value of $010 per
share. The preferred shares were convertible, at the option of the holder, into
shares of common stock which was subject to the three-for-two forward split. The
preferred shares were redeemable at the option of a majority of the preferred
stockholders, any time after four years from the date of issuance, provided that
the Company had not achieved certain financial results or completed a public
offering of common stock, both as defined.
On June 21, 1996, the Company completed a private placement of 1,210,861
shares of Series A preferred stock at a price of $286 per share, for net
proceeds of $3,049,406. The private placement included 135,678 preferred shares
issued to noteholders. In the event of the Company liquidation, or redemption
of the preferred shares, the Series A preferred stockholders were entitled to
$286 per share plus unpaid dividends equal to 15% of the liquidation value per
annum.
During 1997, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to authorize a
new class of preferred stock, consisting of 2,725,998 convertible Series B
preferred shares with a par value of $010 per share. On September 16, 1997, the
Company completed a private placement of 2,517,894 shares of Series B preferred
stock at a price of $499 per share, for net proceeds of $12,514,291. In the
event of the Company liquidation, or redemption of the preferred shares, the
Series B stockholders were entitled to $499 per share plus unpaid dividends
equal to 15% of the liquidation value per annum.
In August 1998, the Company completed its initial public offering of
3,450,000 shares of common stock at $1200 per share, for net proceeds of
approximately $376 million. Aggregate offering costs were approximately $38
million.
In connection with the initial public offering, 1,210,861 shares of Series A
preferred stock and 2,517,894 shares of Series B preferred stock with a
liquidation value of $286 and $499 per share, respectively, were converted
into common stock. The conversion gave effect to a three-for-two forward split,
resulting in the issuance of 5,593,133 shares of common stock to the preferred
stockholders.
7. Stock Options
Pursuant to the Company 1995 stock option plan the Plan, a committee
appointed by the Company Board of Directors may grant incentive and
nonqualified options to employees, consultants and directors. The Plan, as
amended in 1998, authorizes the grant of options to purchase up to 3,750,000
shares of authorized, but unissued common stock. Incentive stock options have a
ten-year term and non-qualified stock options have a five-year term. A majority
of the stock options vest 25% on the first anniversary date of the grant and
625% each quarter thereafter, with the remaining stock options vesting 100%
five years from the grant date. As of December 31, 1998, an aggregate of
3,850,650 options had been granted under the Plan of which 1,211,250 were
incentive stock options and 2,639,400 were non-qualified stock options.

in accounting for stock options issued to employees and directors. As a result,
for options issued with exercise prices below the estimated fair market value on
the date of grant, the Company recorded deferred compensation expense totaling
approximately $1,227,000 for options granted during the year ended December 31,
1997 and $2,046,000 for options granted during the year ended December 31, 1998.
Such deferred compensation expense will be amortized to operations pro rata over
the forty-eight month option vesting period. Such amortization expense totaled
approximately $83,000 and $688,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997 and
1998, respectively.
The weighted average fair values of options granted during 1996, 1997 and 1998
were $005 and $030 and $628 per share, respectively, using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: no expected dividends, no
volatility in 1996 and 1997 and 895% volatility in 1998, expected life of the
options of three years in 1996 and 1997 and 498 years in 1998 and a risk-free
interest rate of 6% for all years. Had compensation cost for the Company
stock-based compensation plan been determined based upon the fair value of
options on the grant dates, consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123, the
Company 1996, 1997 and 1998 pro forma net income loss would have been as
