Report Of Independent Public Accountants
To the Board of Directors of Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico Bottling Company and
Subsidiaries:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pepsi-Cola
Puerto Rico Bottling Company and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and
September 30, 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income loss,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the three months ended December 31,
1998 and the year ended September 30, 1998. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico
Bottling Company and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and September 30,
1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the three
months ended December 31, 1998 and the year ended September 30, 1998 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

U.S. Dollars in thousands, except per share data
1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS:
Pepsi-Cola Puerto Rico Bottling Company PCPRB and its manufacturing and
distribution subsidiaries bottle, sell and distribute beverages sold primarily
under the Pepsi-Cola trademark in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The
Company division of Cristalia Premium Water Cristalia is engaged in
extracting, processing, bottling and distributing bottled water in Puerto Rico.
Beverage Plastics Company BEV, a wholly owned subsidiary, manufactures
plastic preforms and plastic bottles in Puerto Rico, primarily for use by the
Company. All of the companies operate under exclusive bottling appointments and
franchise agreements with the franchiser, which include operating and marketing
commitments, term limitations and extensions, and conditions for termination.
The Pepsi-Cola exclusive bottling appointments have ten-year terms expiring on
July 17, 2008. Each of the exclusive bottling appointments will automatically
be extended for additional five-year terms unless either party gives one year
written notice.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PCPRB and its
wholly owned subsidiaries the Company. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. As of
September 30, 1997 and 1996, the Company maintained an effective equity
interest in Buenos Aires Embotelladora S. A. BAESA of approximately 17 which was accounted for using the equity method until such investment was
reduced to zero in fiscal year 1996. Effective June 17, 1998, the Company
remaining ownership in BAESA was transferred to the Company existing
shareholders refer to Note 11.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include temporary investments in short-term
securities, primarily discount notes, with original maturities of three months
or less.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes.
Deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and temporary
differences between the Company assets and liabilities for financial
reporting and income tax purposes, using income tax rates currently in effect.
Deferred tax assets are recognized if management believes, based on available
evidence, that it is more likely than not that the future income tax benefits
will be realized. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are classified based upon
the current or long-term classification of the asset or liability giving rise
to the temporary difference or the expected future use of the loss or credit
carryforward.

PEPSI-COLA PUERTO RICO BOTTLING COMPANY...............................................................................................................
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued:
Earnings Per Share
The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share. Accordingly, the Company net loss per common share is
computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Net loss per common share--assuming dilution does not
include the Company potentially dilutive securities refer to Note 17
because to do so would be antidilutive.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock options and other stock-based compensation awards are accounted for using
the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations.
Environmental Remediation Costs
Costs associated with environmental remediation obligations are accrued when
such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Such accruals are adjusted as
further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future
expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to
their present value.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Trade receivables subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk as
substantially all of the Company customers are located in Puerto Rico and two
customers accounted for approximately 14%, 16%, 20% and 22% of the Company
net sales during the three month period ended December 31, 1998 and the fiscal
years 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. However, the Company customer base
is comprised of a large number of entities and the Company performs background
checks and other reviews before extending credit to potential customers. In
addition, the Company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts based upon
factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends
and other information. Management believes there are no significant
concentrations of credit risk with any individual party or groups of parties.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The estimated fair value of the company financial instruments approximate
their carrying values.
Reclassifications
Certain fiscal year 1998, 1997 and 1996 balances have been reclassified to
conform to the December 31, 1998 presentation.
3. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:
Effective October 1, 1998 the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 132,
Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits which
required, among other items, additional disclosures on changes in the Company
pension benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets refer to Note 16.
4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE:
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1998, a restructuring charge of $1,728
was established under a plan to improve the Company performance. The charge
included approximately $679 of severance and related charges for the
elimination
31
PEPSI-COLA PUERTO RICO BOTTLING COMPANY...............................................................................................................
4. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE Continued:
of 17 administrative personnel, $224 of accruals for future payments to exit
activities, including canceling lease agreements, and $825 of asset writedowns
related to the elimination of certain product lines and exiting certain other
business strategies. Management anticipates the restructuring plan will provide
annual savings of approximately $1,300 to $1,400 beginning in 1999. Severance
payments in the three month period ended December 31, 1998 and in fiscal year
1998 totaled approximately $409 and $47, respectively, while payments relating
to other exit activities approximated $116 and $108, respectively.
5. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS:
In fiscal year 1996, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed of. This statement addresses the timing of recognition and the
measurement of impairment of a long-lived assets, certain identifiable
intangibles and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used, and b
long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of. This
statement requires that such assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be
recoverable, and that such assets be reported at the lower of carrying amount
or fair value.
During fiscal year 1996, the Company consolidated its manufacturing activities
into a new manufacturing facility. Based upon a 1996 appraisal of the former
facility, the Company recorded a noncash charge of $1,400; $800 for the
impairment of the manufacturing plant no longer in operation and being held for
sale, and $600 for certain manufacturing equipment and furniture no longer in
use. During fiscal year 1998, the Company recorded a noncash charge of $800 for
the additional impairment of the idle manufacturing plant held for sale. This
charge represented management best estimate of an anticipated loss from the
disposition of the plant in a current transaction between willing parties. The
resulting carrying value of the manufacturing plant is consistent with a 1998
appraisal on the facility obtained during the three months ended December 31,
1998.
The Company has agreed to sell substantially all net assets relating to the
bottling, sale and distribution of potable water under the Cristalia
tradename to Cristalia Acquisition Corp., a corporation whose president is a
former officer of the Company. The sales price is based upon the net book value
of the net assets of the business as of December 31, 1998, and resulted in a
charge of $250 for the impairment of the net assets. The noncash charge was
recorded in the three month period ended December 31, 1998 as a writedown of
Cristalia long-lived assets and is reflected as an asset impairment loss in
the accompanying consolidated statement of income loss.
6. INSURANCE PROCEEDS FROM BUSINESS INTERRUPTION LOSSES:
For the period from September 22, 1998 through October 21, 1998, the Company
incurred business interruption losses resulting from Hurricane Georges. In the
opinion of management and pursuant to a preliminary review by the insurer,
collection of a claim filed under the Company business interruption insurance
policy is probable. As a result, included in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income loss are anticipated recoveries of $346 for the three
month period ended December 31, 1998 and $1,309 for fiscal year 1998
attributable to business interruption and other losses.

exceed 40 years. Other intangibles are amortized using the straight-line method
over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets consisted of the

carrying value or a revision to the estimated useful lives is appropriate. The
Company recorded a noncash charge of approximately $600 in fiscal year 1996 in
order to write off intangible assets.

also halted trading in BAESA American Depository Shares.
34
PEPSI-COLA PUERTO RICO BOTTLING COMPANY...............................................................................................................
11. INVESTMENT IN BAESA Continued:
During fiscal year 1998, BAESA entered into a long-term financial restructuring
plan with its major debt holders in Argentina whereby BAESA unsecured lenders
exchanged debt for substantially all of the equity in BAESA. The Company did
not exercise its right under a related rights offering to retain its current
proportionate ownership in BAESA, resulting in a dilution of the Company
equity interest from approximately 17% to approximately 034%. Effective June
17, 1998, the Company remaining ownership in BAESA was transferred to the
Company existing shareholders. The Company recorded investment in BAESA had
already been reduced to zero in fiscal year 1996.

13. INCOME TAXES:
PCPRB and its subsidiaries are Delaware corporations subject to U.S. federal
income taxes; however, PCPRB subsidiaries are eligible for and have elected
the benefit of Section 936 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Section 936
presently allows a tax credit equal to a portion of the amount of U.S. income
taxes attributable to earnings derived from operations within Puerto Rico and
to certain qualified investments maintained in Puerto Rico, subject to certain
limitations. PCPRB subsidiaries have elected to claim the credit under the
Economic Activity Limitation method. The 1996 Small Business Act the Act
repealed the Section 936 credit prospectively. However, the Act grandfathered
in existing credit claimants during a ten-year transition period. The credit
under the Economic Activity Limitation for Puerto Rico will be calculated under
the rules existing prior to the adoption of the Act for taxable years beginning
after 1995 and before 2002. For taxable years beginning after December 31,
2001, a cap is placed upon the Puerto Rican source business income eligible for
the credit. For tax years beginning after January 1, 2006, the economic
activity credit is repealed in its entirety.
In order to utilize income tax credits available under Section 936, each
subsidiary is required to derive at least 80% of its gross income from sources
within Puerto Rico, and at least 75% of gross income must be from an active
trade or business in Puerto Rico. PCPRB subsidiaries were in compliance with
these gross income requirements for the three months ended December 31, 1998
and the fiscal years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996.
Effective October 1998, the Company was granted an additional ten-year Puerto
Rican tax incentives exemption for its plastic preforms manufacturing and sales
operation. Under the terms of the grant, BEV received a 90% exemption from
Puerto Rico income tax, a 60% exemption from municipal tax and a 90% exemption
from property tax. In exchange for these tax exemptions, the Company agreed to
manufacture plastic preforms and plastic bottles, employ a minimum number of
persons and maintain equipment and facilities in Puerto Rico.

The subsequent recognition of tax benefits related to the valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 1998 and September 30, 1998 and 1997
will be allocated to income from continuing operations.
At December 31, 1998, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss
carryforwards approximating $54,200 which expire through 2019, and Puerto Rico
tax net operating loss carryforwards approximating $76,300 which expire through
2006. As a result of the change in control transaction in fiscal year 1998
refer to Note 15, the Company utilization of its U.S. federal net operating
loss carryforwards is limited annually. Realization of all of these future
income tax benefits is dependent on the existence of future taxable income.
Valuation allowances covering substantially all of the Company net operating
loss carryforwards have been provided as the Company does not believe it is
more likely than not that the future income tax benefits will be realized.

former president.
Certain former members of the Company Board of Directors and certain of its
former executive officers were also directors and/or officers of BAESA until
approximately mid-1996. During fiscal year 1996, BAESA charged PCPRB management
fees totaling approximately $888. In addition, PCPRB sold $2,235 in preforms to
BAESA pursuant to a long-term supply contract. In management opinion, the
terms of this contract were reasonable, and at the time of the contract no
other comparable contract from an outside party was available to BAESA. The
above described contract was terminated during the year ended September 30,
1997. Pursuant to the termination agreement, Company obligations to BAESA of
approximately $2,065 were settled for a cash payment of $50. In addition, the
Company was relieved of obligations relating to certain operating leases. The
resulting gain on early termination of the supply agreement was recorded in
fiscal year 1996.
During fiscal year 1996, the Company paid approximately $151 in construction
management fees to a former shareholder and director of the Company.
During fiscal year 1996, the Company paid approximately $232 in consulting fees
to a former shareholder of BAESA and a former director of the Company.
15. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY:
Pursuant to the terms of a ten-year voting trust agreement and related stock
option agreement executed on September 28, 1996, the 5,000,000 authorized and
outstanding Class A shares were placed into a voting trust. The then trustee of
the trust was the president of the Company, who held an unrestricted right to
vote such shares and had the right to purchase such shares, for the benefit of
the Company, through September 28, 1998 at $1 per share. In a transfer
agreement the Agreement effective July 17, 1998, the president assigned to
P-PR Transfer, LLP the Partnership the stock option agreement for the
purchase of the Class A shares. The Partnership paid the Company $23,750 under
the Agreement and simultaneously purchased the 5,000,000 Class A shares for $1
per share. Payments by the Partnership to the Company pursuant to the Agreement
are recorded as additional shareholders' equity, net of approximately $1,599 in
equity issuance costs.

15. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Continued:
Also effective July 17, 1998, the Partnership purchased a total of 6,210,429
Class B shares under stock option agreements between the Partnership and the
Class B shareholders. V. Suarez & Co., Inc. Suarez then purchased 1,000,000
Class A shares and 1,242,085 Class B shares from the Partnership. The
combination of these transactions resulted in a change in control of the
Company.
On July 17, 1998, the Company issued a warrant to the Partnership and Suarez
for the purchase of an additional 1,360,000 and 340,000 Class B shares,
respectively, for $6875 per share, exercisable at any time during the 90 month
period from the date of the warrant.
The Class A shares have a six-to-one voting preference over the Class B shares.
16. PENSION PLANS:
The Company maintains separate non-contributory salaried and hourly defined
benefit pension plans covering eligible salaried and hourly employees of the
Company. Benefits under the salaried plan are based upon years of service and
average earnings during the last five years of employment, while benefits under
the hourly plan represent a fixed amount times years of credited service. The
Company makes annual contributions to the plans as required by applicable
regulations. Contributions provide benefits for service rendered to date and
for services expected to be performed in the future. The plans are insured by
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. On April 16, 1997, the Company
suspended future participation in the plans for an indeterminable period. As a
result, the projected benefit obligation is equal to the accumulated benefit
obligation for each plan. At present management does not intend to terminate
the plans.
The Company recognizes a minimum pension liability, computed as the excess of
the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets, with an
adjustment to shareholders' equity.

17. STOCK OPTION PLANS:
In fiscal year 1997, the Company adopted two stock option plans the plans
pursuant to which the Company Board of Directors may grant stock options to
certain employees and directors of the Company and its affiliates who have
served in such capacities for at least one year prior to the date the options
are granted. The plans authorize grants of options to purchase up to 1,000,000
shares of authorized but unissued Class B common stock. At December 31, 1998,
there were 247,500 shares available for grant under these plans. One of these
stock option plans is designed to be qualified for income tax purposes, whereas
the other is not a qualified plan.
Stock options under the qualified plan are granted with an exercise price equal
to the stock fair market value at the date of the grant. Stock options under
the nonqualified plan may have an exercise price below the stock fair market
value at the date of grant below market options. In accordance with APB
Opinion No. 25, deferred compensation is recorded to reflect any difference
between the exercise price and market value of shares granted under the
nonqualified plan for below market options, and is expensed over the vesting
period of the options. During the three months ended December 31, 1998, the
Company granted below market options to acquire 452,500 shares of the Company
Class B stock, which vest over five years. Accordingly, deferred compensation
expense of $50 was recorded related to this grant. All stock options vest and
become fully exercisable in accordance with the terms of their grant.

PEPSI-COLA PUERTO RICO BOTTLING COMPANY...............................................................................................................
17. STOCK OPTION PLANS Continued:
In fiscal year 1997, the Company entered into a stock option agreement with its
former president to acquire 1,516,667 Class B common shares of the Company at
an exercise price of $500 per share. These stock options will be exercisable
in whole or in part until exercised in full.
The Company accounts for these plans using the intrinsic value method. Had
compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company net loss and net loss
per common share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts:
Fiscal Years
Three   Ended September
Months Ended    30
December 31,                     1998    1998   1997
Net loss:
As reported         $1,420  $ 9,610 $19,503
Pro forma           1,646  10,262 25,510
Net loss per common share:
As reported         $ 007  $ 045 $ 091
Pro forma           008   047  119
The effect on pro forma net loss and net loss per common share of expensing the
estimated fair value of stock options is not necessarily representative of the
effect on reported earnings in future years due to the vesting period of stock
options and the potential for issuance of additional stock options in future
years.
The weighted average fair value of options granted for the three months ended
December 31, 1998 and in fiscal years 1998 and 1997 were $306, $491 and
$352, respectively. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions:
Fiscal
Years

weighted average exercise price of all options and options exercisable was
$477 and $517, respectively, and the weighted average remaining contractual
life of all options and options exercisable was 893 years and 828 years,
respectively.

facility, to settle two outstanding supplier claims and to establish legal
reserves for various litigation, claims and assessments. All payments related
to this reserve are expected to be made within one year.
Settlement of Litigation
The Company was formerly a defendant in nine class actions alleging federal
securities violations by the Company and various former officers and directors
of the Company. These claims were settled as of September 30, 1997. The Company
has recorded the cost of the settlement in fiscal year 1997 as follows:
Cost of 2,500,000 Class B shares effectively contributed by the
founding shareholders, valued using the average trading price of the
stock for a period of trade dates prior to the date of the
settlement                              $13,172
Cash payments of $2,500, less recovery from insurers                                                                                    $13,172
As a part of the settlement, the Company was reimbursed $4,000 from its
directors liability insurers, $2,500 of which were deemed a reimbursement of
amounts paid to claimants, with the remainder offset against legal expenses
incurred in connection with the settlement. The contribution of the 2,500,000
Class B shares by the founding shareholders was reflected as a contribution of
capital using the average trading price of the stock referred to above.

settled the Commission charges with an agreement to cease and desist from
committing any violation or future violation of specified securities laws. The
Company was not required to pay any fines or penalties associated with this
settlement.
General Litigation
The Company is subject to various litigation, claims and assessments arising in
the normal course of business. Management believes that the ultimate resolution
of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a
materially adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position or
