1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
MapInfo Corporation MapInfo or the Company designs, develops, markets, licenses and supports location-based software and data products, application development tools, and industry-focused solutions, together with a range of consulting, analytical, training and technical support services. These products are sold through multiple distribution channels, including an indirect channel of value-added resellers and distributors, a corporate account sales force, and a telemarketing sales group. The Company products are translated into 20 languages and sold in 60 countries throughout the world. MapInfo markets its products worldwide through sales offices in North America, Europe, Australia, and throughout the rest of Europe and the Asia-Pacific region through exclusive and non-exclusive distribution relationships.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MapInfo Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purpose of the cash flows statements, the Company defines cash and cash equivalents as cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined on the average cost method and consist primarily of computer media, user manuals and software packaging supplies.
Short-term Investments
The Company short-term investments consist of debt securities with maturity dates of one year or less. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, debt securities have been classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as held-to-maturity securities and are reported at amortized cost because the Company has the positive intent and the ability to hold these debt securities to maturity. Market value is determined by quoted market prices.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets two to fifty years for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the applicable costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized.

Product Development Costs
Product development costs, including product enhancements and translation, are capitalized after technological feasibility has been established. These costs are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are being amortized on a straight-line basis up to two years, the estimated economic life of the products. Annual amortization under the straight-line method is greater than the ratio of current gross revenue to total expected product revenues method. 
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets
The Company records goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsSFAS 142. SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment, at least annually, and written down when impaired. Furthermore, SFAS 142 requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives, unless the useful lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the useful lives of the respective assets and is being amortized over three to ten years.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenues from product software and data licenses, product maintenance and professional services. Maintenance includes software defect or error fixes and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. Professional services primarily consists of consulting, analytical services, tech support and training. 
The Company sells its products and services primarily through a direct sales team, Value Added Resellers, Distributors and Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM Partners.
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SOP 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition and SOP 98-9 Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions when all of the following conditions are met: 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, 2 delivery has occurred, 3 the vendor fee is fixed or determinable, and 4 collectibility is probable.
The Company also uses the residual method under SOP 98-9. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue, assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied. Substantially all of the Company product revenue is recognized in this manner. If the Company cannot determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in an arrangement, the Company will defer revenue until all elements are delivered, until services are performed or until fair value of the undelivered elements can be objectively determined. In circumstances where the Company offers significant and incremental fair value discounts for future purchases of other software products or services to its customers as part of an arrangement, utilizing the residual method the Company defers the value of the discount and recognizes such discount against revenue as the related p
roduct or service is delivered.

1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Product revenue: Revenue from product licenses is recognized upon the shipment of product or the granting of licenses and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met, in accordance with SOP 97-2 and SOP 98-9. 
Postcontract customer support PCS: PCS, inclusive of technical support and maintenance, may be bundled with an initial licensing fee or sold separately. In either case, the fair value of the PCS arrangement is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, generally over a one to two year period.
Multiple element arrangements: Multiple-element arrangements of the Company consist primarily of software licenses sold with 1-year maintenance arrangements. Maintenance arrangements are sold separately from, or as a premium to the product license fee and accordingly, vendor specific objective evidence VSOE is determinable. Fees for multiple-element arrangements are allocated to the various elements of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements. The fair value used to allocate to the elements is based on VSOE of fair values of the elements. VSOE is determined by the price charged when the same element is sold separately or as an incremental fee.
Services revenue: Revenue from services such as business consulting services, analytical services, systems integration and custom application development, and training are recognized when the services are delivered. Services are generally delivered under a time and materials or milestone contract. Under a time and materials contract, services are billed and revenue is recognized as the services are performed. Under a milestone contract, services are billed and revenue is recognized when the contract-stated milestone is completed.
Acceptance provisions: Some of the Company product and service arrangements with customers include acceptance provisions. In those cases in which significant uncertainties exist with respect to customer acceptance or in which specific customer acceptance criteria are included in the arrangement, the Company defers the entire arrangement fee and recognizes revenue, assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied, when the uncertainty regarding acceptance is resolved as generally evidenced by written acceptance by the customer.
OEM Revenue: Revenue from products licensed to original equipment manufacturers is recorded when the product has been shipped and all obligations of the Company have been satisfied.
Value Added Reseller VAR Sales: Revenue from product sales to distributors and resellers is recorded when related products are shipped and all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses all advertising costs as they are incurred.

Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable for future years to differences between financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The effect of tax rate changes on deferred taxes is recognized in the income tax provision in the period that includes the enactment date. Business tax credits are recorded by the flow-through method of accounting, whereby they are applied as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credits are utilized.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.
Foreign Currency
The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, and the income statements are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating non-U.S. currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income. The Company exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated, in part, by the fact that it incurs certain operating costs in the same foreign currencies in which revenues are denominated.
Computation of Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and diluted common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Diluted common equivalent shares consist of stock options using the treasury stock method. 
Employee Stock Option Plans
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, amends the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123, to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.
The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No. 25. Under the intrinsic value method, because the exercise price of the Company employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized in the Company Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company is required under SFAS No. 123 to disclose pro forma information regarding option grants made to its employees based on specified valuation techniques that produce estimated compensation charges. The pro forma information is as follows in thousands, except per-share amounts Years ended September 30, 2004 2003 2002 Net income loss, as reported 5,123  1,085 2,355 Stock-based employee compensation expense, net of related tax effects determined under fair value based method for all awards

Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate, in management opinion, the existing valuation models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of the Company employee stock options. For additional information regarding this pro forma information, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Segment Information
The Company uses the management approach to reporting its segments. The management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company reportable segments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of SFAS No. 150 as a liability. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46. This interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interest in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. This interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. Variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interest that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed. FIN 46 was revised in December 2003 and is effective for the first financial reporting period after March 15, 2004. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 46 beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2004, which did not have a material impact on the financial statements.

The Company invested 100 million Yen approximately $750 thousand to acquire the 167% equity position and 400 million Yen approximately $37 million in three debt instruments with warrants that could be converted over time into as much as a 51% common stock ownership position. In February 2002, the Company redeemed, at face value, one debt instrument of 100 million Yen approximately $750 thousand. In addition, the remaining two debt instruments with warrants were converted into equity, which increased the Company ownership in Alps to 49%. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As of September 30, 2004 and 2003 $15 million and $31 million, respectively, pertaining to this investment was included on the Company balance sheet under the caption Investment and 
other assets. This long-lived asset is included in Note 16 Segment Information in the Long-Lived Asset group reported for the U.S. In addition, under an advisory agreement with an investment-banking firm in Japan, the Company agreed to make a cash payment of up to $20 million to the investment-banking firm based on the financial performance of Alps over the four fiscal years ending September 30, 2004. Any payment earned under this agreement would be made after results through September 30, 2004 for Alps have been received and the Company is able to calculate any payment due. The Company believes this payment will be approximately $250 thousand based on the latest projections the Company received from Alps through September 2004. The Company believes this amount to be unrecoverable and has recorded a $250 thousand charge to earnings during fiscal year 2004. Any difference between the estimated $250 thousand and the actual payment amount would be recorded to the Company results of operations during fisca
l year 2005.
During fiscal year 2004, the Company recorded an impairment loss on its investment in Alps based on losses incurred by Alps and projections provided to the Company from Alps during the fiscal year. The Company determined the fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows as compared to the Company investment balance. An impairment charge of $622 thousand was charged to earnings during fiscal year 2004 and is included on the Company Consolidated Income Statement under the caption Other income expense, net.

8.Mortgage Payable and Credit Facility
Mortgage Payable. On December 21, 2001, the Company entered into a mortgage loan and other related agreements with a commercial bank to finance construction of a 150,000 square foot office building in Troy, New York and the related land lease. The total construction financing borrowed under this financing arrangement was $151 million. In December 2002, the Company converted the entire construction loan to a ten-year mortgage loan. Principal together with interest, at a rate of LIBOR plus 225%, with a 350% minimum, is payable monthly. As of September 30, 2004, the outstanding balance due on this mortgage loan was $145 million.
Credit Facility. In January 2003, the Company borrowed $30 million under a one-year revolving credit facility with a commercial bank. In March 2003, the Company converted this obligation into a forty-two month term loan. Principal outstanding under this term loan is payable monthly in forty-one equal installments of $72 thousand and a final payment of $69 thousand, along with interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 175%. The balance outstanding under this term loan agreement as of September 30, 2004 was $19 million. 
In addition, the Company has a $100 million credit facility with a commercial bank that expires on March 31, 2005. As of September 30, 2004 and 2003, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. During fiscal year 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with a bank to provide a credit facility for up to $150 million that expires on September 28, 2005. On September 30, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. 
Future minimum payments required under loan agreements that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of September 30, 2004 are $12 million, 2005; $12 million, 2006; $457 thousand, 2007; $315 thousand, 2008; $315 thousand, 2009 and $129 million thereafter. 
9. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
In order to reduce exposure to movements in interest rates, in January 2003 the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert its variable rate mortgage loan to a fixed rate. The agreement involves the exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payments over the ten-year life of the loan. The variable interest rate on the mortgage loan is the greater of 35% or the sum of the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 225%. The interest rate swap has fixed the effective interest rate that we will pay at 682%. The 682% interest rate is based on the assumption that the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 225% is 35% or higher, due to the interest rate minimum which applies to the mortgage. The impact of the fluctuations in interest rates on the interest rate swap agreement will be naturally offset by the opposite impact on the related mortgage debt. The Company accounts for this interest rate swap in accordance with SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
At September 30, 2004, and 2003 the fair value of the swap agreement, which represents the cash the Company would pay to settle the agreement, was $397 thousand and $596 thousand, respectively. The current portion of $48 thousand and $64 thousand is included on the balance sheet under the caption Accrued liabilities and the long-term portion of $349 thousand and $532 thousand is included under the caption Other long-term liabilities for September 30,

2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company records the payments or receipts on the agreement as adjustments to interest expense. The Company recognized interest expense related to the swap of $504 thousand for fiscal year 2004 and $332 thousand for fiscal year 2003.
10.Commitments and Contingencies

Deferred income taxes recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2004 and 2003 consist of the following temporary differences US Non-US September 30 September 30 2004 2003 2004 2003 Current deferred tax assets liabilities Accrued expenses 140 282 540 488 Bad debt reserve 96 112   Inventory 95 83   Allowance for returns 149 187   Other current assets 30 31 37 59 Net current deferred tax assets 510 695 503 429 Long term deferred tax assets liabilities Capitalized product development costs 90 91   Tax credit carryovers 3,109 3,075   Property and equipment 452 559 491 452 Intangible assets 97 271 2,861 184 Net Operating Loss 10,173 10,765   Other non-current assets 746 301 47  14,293 14,880 2,417 268 Less: Valuation Allowance 133 260   Net long term deferred tax assets liabilities 14,160 14,620 2,417 268 Net Deferred Tax Assets Liabilities 14,670  15,315  1,914 697 Non-U.S. net long-term deferred tax liability of $24 million is included in the balance sheet under the caption Other long-term liabilities. 
The increase in U.S. deferred tax assets from 2003 to 2004 includes $384 thousand of deferred tax benefit resulting from stock option exercises and the net decrease in Non-U.S. deferred tax assets from 2003 to 2004 includes an increase of $48 thousand resulting from translation adjustment and a decrease of $26 million resulting from purchase accounting from the acquisition of Southbank establishing a deferred tax liability.
The valuation allowance at September 30, 2004 and 2003 was $133 thousand and $260 thousand, respectively. The valuation allowance decreased by $127 thousand. The Company is required to assess the realization of the deferred tax assets. Significant changes in circumstances may require adjustments during interim or annual periods. In 2004 a portion of the Company future tax benefits related to foreign tax credits required a valuation allowance, in 2003 the Company future tax benefits related to foreign tax credits were fully reserved as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized due to their short carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized principally based upon forecasted taxable income generally within the twenty-year RD credit and net operating loss carryforward periods, giving consideration to the benefits realized to date through the restructuring
program. The amount of net deferred tax assets actually could vary if there are differences in timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the actual amounts of future

taxable income. If the forecast is determined to no longer be reliable due to uncertain market conditions or improvement in the results of operations does not continue, the long-term forecast will require reassessment. As a result, the Company may need to establish additional valuation allowances for all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets. 
The Company has not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on approximately $151 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because management considers such earnings to be permanently reinvested. In the event such earnings are distributed, the Company may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding, net of allowable foreign tax credits or deductions.
12.Stockholders' Equity
Earnings Per Share
The following represents the basic and diluted earnings per share amounts for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002 in thousands, except per share amounts Year Ended September 30 2004 2003 2002 Net income 5,123  1,085 2,355 Weighted average shares for basic EPS 17,959 15,307 15,041 Effect of dilutive stock options 555   Weighted average shares and assumed exercise of stock options for diluted EPS 18,514 15,307 15,041 Basic EPS 029  007 016 Diluted EPS 028 007 016 The impact of options for the years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 was anti-dilutive and therefore was excluded from the calculation. If the impact of options had not been anti-dilutive, the effect of dilutive options would have been 191,000 and 305,000, respectively. The impact of outstanding stock options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the average market price of the Company common stock was anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation. Outstanding stock options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the average market price of the Company common stock for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003, and 2002 were 752,000 shares, 1,554,000 shares, and 1,102,000 shares, respectively.

16.Segment Information 
The Company operations involve the design, development, marketing, licensing and support of software and data products, application development tools, and industry-specific solutions, together with a range of consulting, analytical, training and technical support services.
The Company conducts business globally and is managed geographically. The Company management relies on an internal management accounting system. This system includes revenue and cost information by geographic location. Revenues are attributed to a geographic location based on the origination of the order from the customer. The Company management makes financial decisions and allocates resources based on the information it receives from this internal system. Based on the criteria set forth in SFAS No. 131, the Company has reportable segments by geography: the Americas, EMEA Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific.
The Company geographic segments are discussed below.

19.Issuance of Additional Common Stock
On April 2, 2004 the Company completed a follow-on public offering of its common stock. The Company sold 4,312,500 shares of common stock at an offering price of $1100. Net proceeds, after the underwriters' discount and offering expenses, were approximately $442 million.
In connection with this offering, on February 24, 2004, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 Commission No333-113029 with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the public offering of 3,750,000 shares of the Company common stock. On February 23, 2004, an employee of Adams, Harkness Hill, Inc., one of the underwriters in the Company offering, made an unauthorized disclosure to one prospective institutional investor, and on February 24, 2004 and February 25, 2004, employees of First Albany Capital Inc., the lead underwriter in the Company offering, sent unauthorized emails to approximately 223 addressees. The unauthorized pre-filing disclosure by the Adams Harkness employee may have constituted an impermissible pre-filing offer under the Securities Act of 1933, and the unauthorized emails by the employees of First Albany may have constituted a prospectus that does not meet the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, each of which may entitle the recipie
nts of the unauthorized disclosure and emails to rescission rights if they purchased shares of the Company common stock in the offering. The rescission rights would allow any recipient, for a period of one year from the date of such recipient purchase of shares of the Company common stock in the offering, to seek recovery of the consideration paid in connection with the purchase. Adams Harkness Hill, Inc. and First Albany Capital Inc. have agreed to indemnify the Company for losses, costs, and expenses that the Company may incur as a result of the unauthorized disclosure and the emails. As such, the Company does not expect the effect of the unauthorized disclosure and emails to have a material impact on the Company results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
