Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of FactSet Research SystemsInc. 
We
have completed an integrated audit of FactSet Research System Inc 2005 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2005 and
audits of its 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below. 
Consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FactSet Research
Systems Inc and its subsidiaries at August31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August31, 2005 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under 
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Internal
control over financial reporting 
Also, in our opinion, management assessment, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. The
Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of
internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The significant accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries are summarized below. 
Financial
Statement Presentation. 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany activity and balances have been eliminated from the
consolidated financial statements. 
Shares
of common stock and related per share amounts give retroactive effect for stock splits. All shares of common stock and related per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a
three-for-two common stock split, effected as a stock dividend, which occurred on February4, 2005. 
Use
Of Estimates. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Significant estimates have been made in areas that include income and other taxes, depreciable lives of fixed and intangible assets, accrued liabilities, accrued
compensation, receivable reserves and allocation of purchase price to assets and liabilities acquired. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Revenue
Recognition. 
FactSet applies Staff Accounting Bulletin No104 SAB 104, Revenue Recognition, to its business arrangements for revenue
recognition. The majority of clients are invoiced monthly, in arrears, to reflect the actual services rendered. Other clients are invoiced in advance on an annual and quarterly basis, respectively.
Subscription revenue is earned each month as the service is rendered to clients, according to the specific subscription and the number of workstations deployed for such month. A provision is estimated
for billing adjustments and uncollectible accounts. Such provisions are accounted for as a reduction of subscription revenue, with a corresponding reduction to subscriptions receivable. FactSet
recognizes revenue when all the following criteria are met: The
client subscribes to FactSet research services,
the
FactSet service has been rendered and earned during the month,
the
amount of the subscription is fixed and determinable based on established rates for each product offering, quoted on an annualized basis, and
collectibility
is reasonably assured. 
24  Under
the guidance in SAB 104, the Company subscriptions represent a single earnings process. Collection of subscription revenues through FDS external clearing brokers does not represent a
separate service or earnings process since FDS is not the principal party to the settlement of the securities transactions for which the clearing brokers charge clearing fees. 
Amounts
that have been earned but not yet paid through the receipt of commissions on securities transactions or through cash payments are reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial
Condition as receivables from clients and clearing brokers, net. Amounts billed in advanced are recorded as receivables from clients and deferred revenues when invoiced. The receivable is reduced upon
receipt of payment and the deferred revenue is reduced each month when the service is provided and the revenue recognition process is complete, as described above. As of August31, 2005, the
amount of receivables from clients and clearing brokers, net that was unbilled totaled $267million. Since the Company invoices its clients monthly in arrears, the $267million
unbilled as of August31, 2005 was billed at the beginning of September2005. Amounts that have been received through commissions on securities transactions or through cash payments that
are in excess of earned subscription revenues are reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as deferred fees. 
The
Company calculates a receivable reserve through analyzing aged client receivables each month and reviewing historical company information, industry trends and general market conditions. 
Cost
Of Services. 
Cost of services is composed of employee compensation and benefits for the software engineering and consulting groups, clearing fees net of recoveries, data costs, amortization
of identifiable intangible assets, computer maintenance and depreciation expenses and client-related communication costs. 
Selling,
General Administrative. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses include employee compensation and benefits for the sales, product development and various other support departments, travel and
entertainment expenses, promotional costs, rent, amortization of leasehold improvements, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office expenses, professional fees and other expenses. 
Cash
And Cash Equivalents. 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market investments with maturities of 90days or less and are reported at fair value. Investments. 
Investments have maturities greater than 90days from the date of acquisition, are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at
fair value. Fair value is determined for most investments from readily available quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included
net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. 
Property,
Equipment And Leasehold Improvements. 
Computers and related equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of three years or less. Depreciation of furniture and fixtures
is recognized using the double declining balance method over estimated useful lives between five years and seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the terms of the related leases or estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever period is shorter. 
Goodwill. Goodwill has resulted from the acquisitions of the Insyte, LionShares, Mergerstat, CallStreet, JCF, TrueCourse and DSI businesses. We performed an annual goodwill impairment
test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 and determined that there had been no impairment. 
Intangible
Assets. 
Intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, acquired technology, trade names, non-compete agreements, customer relationships and certain acquired
content databases resulting from the acquisitions of the Insyte, LionShares, Mergerstat, CallStreet, JCF, TrueCourse and DSI businesses and are amortized on either a straight-line or an
accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and twenty years. 
Internal
Use Software. 
The Company capitalizes only those direct costs incurred during the application development and implementation stages for developing, purchasing or otherwise acquiring software
for internal use that management believes have a probable future application in the Company subscription-based service. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying
software, generally three years or less. All costs incurred during the preliminary planning project stage, including project scoping, identification and testing of alternatives, are expensed as
incurred. Capitalized direct costs associated with developing, purchasing or otherwise acquiring software for internal use are reported in the Property, Equipment Leasehold Improvements line
item of the Company Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the software, beginning when the
software is implemented and ready for its intended use. 
25  Landlord
Contributions To Leasehold Improvements. 
In conjunction with entering into leases for office space, the Company receives contributions from landlords toward leasehold improvements which are included in the Deferred
Rent and Other Non-Current Liabilities line item of the Company Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. These contributions are amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the
non-cancelable lease terms to which they pertain. 
Accrued
Liabilities. 
Accrued liabilities include estimates relating to employee compensation, operating expenses and tax liabilities. Most of our employee incentive compensation programs are
discretionary. A final review of departmental and individual performance is conducted each year end determining the ultimate amount of discretionary bonus pools. 
Income
And Deferred Taxes. 
Deferred taxes are determined by calculating the future tax consequences associated with differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A
valuation allowance is established to the extent management considers it more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes from
income tax law changes is recognized immediately upon enactment. The deferred tax provision is derived from changes in deferred taxes on the balance sheet and reflected on the Consolidated Statements
of Income as a component of income taxes. Income tax benefits derived from the exercise of non-qualified stock options or the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options are
recorded directly to capital in excess of par value. 
Comprehensive
Income Loss. 
The Company reports comprehensive income loss in accordance with SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS
No130 establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income loss in a set of financial statements. Comprehensive income loss is defined as the change in net assets
of a business enterprise during a period from transactions generated from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by
owners and distributions to owners. 
Foreign
Currency. 
The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated to United States dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average
rates for the period for revenues and expenses. Translation gains losses related to net monetary assets are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a component of stockholders'
equity. 
Earnings
Per Share. 
The computation of basic earnings per share in each year is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are based on the
weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. Shares available pursuant to grants made under the Company stock option plans are included as common
share equivalents using the treasury stock method. 
Stock-Based
Compensation. 
The Company follows the disclosure-only provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No123 SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. In
December2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure. This statement provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to
the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. The statement also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS123,
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. As permitted by SFAS123, the Company accounts for its stock option and employee stock purchase plans under APB Opinion No25, under which no compensation cost has been
recorded. Stock option exercise prices equal the fair market value of the Company stock price on the date of grant; thus no compensation costs are recorded. Had compensation costs for the Company
stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan been determined 
26  pursuant
to the measurement principles under SFAS123, the Company net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and
2003.

with the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company transitioned from the Black-Scholes options model to a binomial model to estimate the fair value of new stock option grants. Management
believes the binomial option pricing model provides a more refined estimate of the fair value of the Company employee stock options. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for all grants prior to March2005. For option grants in March2005 and thereafter, the fair value of each option grant is
estimated on the date of the grant using a binomial option pricing model. The change in model used to estimate the fair value of new stock option grants had an immaterial effect to the Company
income statement and no effect on our cash flows. The following weighted average assumptions under the Black-Scholes model were used for option grants in the first six months of fiscal 2005 and for
the twelve months ended August31, 2004 and 2003:

Accounting Pronouncements. 
In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued its final standard on accounting for share-based payments SBP, FASB Statement No123R revised
2004 FAS123R, Share-Based Payment, that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards. The standard is
effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after June15, 2005, and applies to all outstanding and unvested SBP awards at a company adoption date. The Company has
adopted FAS123R for all fiscal periods beginning after September1, 2005.

March2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB 107, Share-Based Payment, which provides interpretive guidance
related to the interaction between FAS123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as provides the SEC staff views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements. In
conjunction with the Company implementation of FAS123R, the Company has adopted SAB 107 for all fiscal periods beginning after September1, 2005. 
3. COMMON STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE  On August16, 2005, the Company announced a regular quarterly dividend of $005 per share. The cash dividend was paid on September21, 2005, to common stockholders
of record on August31, 2005. Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: THOUSANDS Years Ended August31 2005 2004 2003 Balance, beginning of year

February4, 2005. 
During
fiscal 2005, FactSet repurchased 342,500 shares at an average cost of $2771 per share. There were no share repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. As a result, the Company has
completed the stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors on July16, 2002. Under the program, FactSet repurchased 1,500,000 shares at an average cost of $2003 per share. The
remaining repurchases during fiscal 2005 were repurchases of common stock owned by employees in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. On
June20, 2005, the Company Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50million of FactSet common stock. Repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market
and privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions. No minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed. No shares have been purchased under this program as of
August31, 2005. The Company intends to fund its share repurchases with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations. 
On
August1, 2005, the Company issued 305,748 common shares as part of the acquisition price of DSI. On September1, 2004, the Company issued 385,601 common shares as part of the
acquisition price of the JCF Group of Companies. On January4, 2005, the Company issued 44,613 common shares as part of the acquisition price of TrueCourse. In
January2004, the Company purchased 3,000,000 shares of its common stock from one of its two co-founders, Howard E. Wille, at a price per share of $2305. In March2004,
the Company purchased an additional 1,500,000 shares of its common stock from its other co-founder, Charles J. Snyder, at a price per share of $2541. The Board of Directors approved both
purchases of common stock from its co-founders prior to the execution of those purchases. The total cash expended for the two common stock purchases was $1073million. 
28  
On March21, 2005, the Board of Directors rescinded the resolution it had previously adopted to terminate the FactSet Research SystemsInc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan the Plan,
but maintained the portion of its prior resolution that provided that all accounts had become fully vested. By further resolution on the same day, the Board separated the Plan into two parts, one to
continue and the other terminated, to allow participants to take advantage of various tax planning opportunities. On June20, 2005, after all participants had elected to receive a distribution
of their shares, either in cash or stock, the Board of Directors terminated the other portion of the Plan as well.

On August1, 2005, FactSet acquired all the outstanding capital stock of DSI pursuant to a stock purchase agreement among FactSet, DSI and Douglas S. Wheeler and other
virtually identical stock purchase agreements with the other shareholders of DSI, all dated as of the same date. FactSet acquired all the outstanding capital stock of DSI for $42,500,000 in cash and
305,748 shares of FactSet common stock. The fair value per share was determined based on the five day average of the market closing price of common stock prior to the acquisition date, including
August1, 2005. The cash portion of the consideration is subject to adjustment based on levels of working capital. To date, FactSet has paid $1,872,000 based on an estimated level of working
capital of DSI. We expect that this acquisition will enhance the Company fixed income offerings and security modeling capabilities. While the company continues to market the DSI product and
services, it plans to more fully develop its fixed income functionality in the portfolio analysis workstation. In addition, we anticipate that the DSI acquisition will further balance the Company
service offerings to both fixed income and equity investment professionals. A portion of the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the DSI net tangible and intangible assets and as a result, we
have recorded goodwill as part of the transaction. 
The
total purchase price of the acquisition is as follows in thousands: Cash paid 44,372 Fair value of FactSet common stock issued 11,275 Estimated direct acquisition costs 256 Total purchase price 55,903 The
final purchase price is dependent on the actual direct acquisition costs and the final working capital adjustment. The total estimated purchase price is being allocated to DSI net tangible and
intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of the acquisition. Based upon the purchase price and the valuation, the preliminary purchase price allocation, which is subject
to change based on working capital adjustments, is as follows in thousands: Tangible assets acquired 6,777 Amortizable intangible assets Software technology 10,685 Customer relationships 4,515 Trade name 98 Non-competition agreements 270 Goodwill 36,857 Total assets acquired 59,202 Liabilities assumed 3,299 Net assets acquired 55,903 29 
Intangible
assets of $156million have been allocated to amortizable intangible assets consisting of software technology, amortized over five years using a straight-line
amortization method; customer relationships, amortized over eight years using an accelerated amortization method; trade name, amortized over 25years using a straight-line
amortization method; and non-competition agreements, amortized over four years using a straight-line amortization method. The weighted average life of the intangible assets is
58years. 
Goodwill
totaling $369million represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually. Any change in the fair value of the net
assets of DSI will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Final purchase accounting adjustments may therefore differ materially from the pro forma adjustments presented here.
Goodwill generated from the DSI acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes. 
The
results of operations of DSI have been included in the Company consolidated statement of operations since the completion of the acquisition on August1, 2005. Included at the end of the
business combination footnote are the results of operations assuming the acquisition occurred at September1, 2003. 
On
January4, 2005, the Company acquired TrueCourse, a provider of corporate takeover defense intelligence, for consideration of $77million, comprised of $60million in cash
and 44,613 shares of FactSet common stock valued at $17million. The fair value per share was determined based on the five day average of the market closing price of common stock prior to the
acquisition date, including January4, 2005. TrueCourse provides a proprietary database of corporate takeover defense profiles to investment banks, institutional money managers and law firms.
This acquisition is consistent with the Company strategy of controlling access to critical content used by its clients. This factor contributed to a purchase price in excess of fair value of the
TrueCourse net tangible and intangible assets. As a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. The weighted average life of the intangible assets is
61years. Goodwill generated from the TrueCourse acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes. 
The
purchase price allocation is as follows in thousands: Tangible assets 430 Amortizable intangible assets Customer relationships 644 Software technology 298 Data content 919 Trade name 191 Non-compete agreements 132 Goodwill 5,440 Total assets acquired 8,054 Liabilities assumed 338 Net assets acquired 7,716 Operating
results of TrueCourse have been included in the Company financial statements from the date of acquisition. Pro forma statements of income have not been presented because the effect of this
acquisition was not material on the Company consolidated financial results. 
On
September1, 2004, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated as of June29, 2004, the Company acquired from Decision Data Luxembourg S.A., all the outstanding stock of Decision
Data System B.V. DDS, the Netherlands holding company that owns all the stock of the JCF Group of companies, in exchange for 385,601 shares of FactSet common stock and
40million in cash. The fair value per share was determined based on the five day average closing market price of common stock surrounding the announcement date. In addition,
up to 5million of contingent consideration will be payable if certain subscription targets are met by November1, 2006. JCF is a supplier of global broker estimates to
institutional investors. JCF provides investment professionals with customizable tools for accessing global broker estimates, analyzing detailed financial information and managing the automatic
generation of research reports. This acquisition is consistent with the Company strategy of controlling access to critical content used by its clients. A portion of the purchase price exceeded the
fair value of the JCF net tangible and intangible assets and as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. 
The
total purchase price of the acquisition is as follows in thousands: Cash consideration 51,943 Fair value of FactSet common stock issued 12,093 Direct acquisition costs 2,076 Total purchase price 66,112 30 
The
total purchase price is being allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of the acquisition. The purchase price allocation is as
follows in thousands: Tangible assets acquired 12,382 Amortizable intangible assets Customer relationships 4,800 Software technology 2,700 Data content 13,200 Trade name 1,000 Non-compete agreements 160 Goodwill 48,205 Total assets acquired 82,447 Liabilities assumed 16,335 Net assets acquired 66,112 Intangible
assets of $219million have been allocated to amortizable intangible assets consisting of customer relationships, amortized over ten years using an accelerated amortization method;
software technology, amortized over seven years using a straight-line amortization method; data content, amortized over twenty years using a straight-line amortization method;
trade name, amortized over three years using a straight-line amortization method; and non-competition agreements, amortized between two and six years using a
straight-line amortization method. The weighted average life of the intangible assets is 153years. 
Goodwill
totaling $482million, included in the European segment, represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill will not be amortized and will
be tested for impairment at least annually. Goodwill generated from the JCF acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes. 
The
results of operations of the JCF Group of Companies have been included in the Company consolidated statement of operations since the completion of the acquisition on September1, 2004.

In June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No141 SFAS141, Business
Combinations, and Statement No142 SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company adopted both of
these standards effective September1, 2001. The provisions of SFAS141 require that business combinations initiated subsequent to June30, 2001, be accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. SFAS141 also establishes certain criteria related to the types of intangible assets that are required to be recognized separate from goodwill. As a result of
applying the provisions of SFAS142, the Company no longer amortizes, on a periodic basis, goodwill that resulted from business combinations consummated prior to June30, 2001. In
connection with the adoption of SFAS142, the Company is required to perform a transitional impairment assessment of goodwill within six months of adoption of this standard. SFAS142
requires that the Company identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each of those reporting units by assigning assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill and intangible
assets, to those reporting units. 
31  
The Company completed its transitional impairment assessment of goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. The Company performs its annual
goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, as well as any additional impairment test required on an event-driven basis. In the fourth quarter of each of fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined that goodwill was not impaired. During fiscal 2005, $905million of goodwill was acquired as a result of the
purchase of the JCF, TrueCourse and DSI businesses. Prior to the adoption of SFAS142, the Company amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over useful lives of seven to
15years.

The
Company identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of acquired technology, customer relationships, trademarks, non-compete agreements and certain acquired content databases
resulting from the acquisitions of the Insyte, LionShares, Mergerstat, CallStreet, JCF, TrueCourse and DSI businesses in August2000, April2001, January2003, May2004,
September2004, January2005 and August2005, respectively. During fiscal 2005, $396million of identifiable intangible assets were added as a result of the acquisitions
of the JCF, TrueCourse and DSI businesses. The acquired businesses and related assets have been fully integrated into the Company operations. The weighted average useful life of all acquired
intangible assets is 1046years. These intangible assets have no assigned residual values. During fiscal 2005, the Company reassessed the estimated useful lives and classification of its
identifiable intangible assets and determined that they are still appropriate.

In the normal course of business, the Company tax filings are subject to audit by federal and state tax authorities. Audits by two taxing authorities are currently ongoing. There is inherent
uncertainty in the audit process. We have made our best estimate of probable liabilities and have recorded an estimate. Nevertheless, the Company has no reason to believe that the audits will result
in additional tax payments or penalties, or both, that would have a material adverse effect on the Company results of operations or financial position, beyond current estimates. The
provisions for income taxes differ from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes as a result of the following
factors: Expressed as a Percentage of

equal to the greater of $5,000 or 667% of aggregate indebtedness the minimum net capital requirement. FDS may be prohibited from paying cash dividends to the Company if such dividends would
result in its net capital falling below the minimum net capital requirement or its ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital exceeding 15 to 1. At all times during the years presented, FDS had
net capital in excess of its minimum net capital requirement. At August31, 2005, FDS had net capital of $105million, which was $102million in excess of its minimum net
capital requirement of $324,000. The ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 046 to 1.

35  12. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS 
Employee
Retirement Plans. 
The Company sponsored an Employee Stock Ownership Plan the Plan or ESOP until March21, 2005. The Board of Directors authorized contributions in the amounts of
$22million and $25million for the years ended August31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. There was no authorized contribution in fiscal 2005. Such contributions were recorded in
cost of services and selling, general and administrative as compensation expense. 
On
March21, 2005, the Board of Directors rescinded the resolution it had previously adopted to terminate the FactSet Research SystemsInc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan the Plan,
but maintained the portion of its prior resolution that provided that all accounts had become fully vested. By further resolution on the same day, the Board separated the Plan into two parts, one to
continue and the other which was terminated, to allow participants to take advantage of various tax planning opportunities. On June20, 2005, after all participants had elected to receive a
distribution of their shares, either in cash or stock, the Board of Directors terminated the other portion of the Plan as well. Distributions may be paid in the form of cash or the Company common
stock. In cash distributions, the Company purchases the common stock in the participant ESOP account at the closing price of the Company common stock on the last day of the month in which the
distribution is requested by the participant of the Plan. These repurchases of common stock from employees are included in both treasury stock on the Consolidated Statements of Changes in
Stockholders' Equity and in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
The
Plan held 724,598; 2,144,414; and 2,386,790 shares of the Company common stock at August31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At
January1, 2005, the Company implemented an employer-funded matching component to its existing 401k retirement plan whereby FactSet matches up to 4% of employees' bi-weekly
earnings, capped at the IRS annual maximum. Company matching contributions are subject to a five year graduated vesting schedule. All full-time employees are eligible for the matching
contribution by the Company. For the period January1, 2005 through August31, 2005, the Company contributed $14million in matching contributions to employee 401k accounts. 
Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. 
The Company implemented an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan in fiscal 2001 for all eligible employees. Under the Purchase Plan, shares of the Company common
stock may be purchased at three-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of FactSet common stock on the first or the last day of each three-month period. Employee purchases may not
exceed 10% of their gross compensation during an offering period. During fiscal 2005, employees purchased 85,000 shares at an average price of $2719. At August31, 2005, 362,000 shares were
reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 
Restricted
Stock Plans. 
During fiscal 2005, the Company granted restricted stock awards which entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests over time. The Company restricted stock
awards generally vest ratably over a four-year period. Restricted stock grants are amortized to expense over the vesting period using the straight-line attribution method. The
Company granted 49,178 shares of common stock in restricted stock grants during fiscal 2005. Based on the $3751 average market price of FactSet common stock on the grant date, a deferred compensation
charge of $18million was recorded to stockholders' equity, and is being amortized ratably to compensation expense over the vesting period of four years. In 2005, a non-cash
compensation charge of $38,000 was recorded as an expense. 
Stock
Option Plans. 
Options granted under the Company Stock Option Plans the Option Plans expire not more than ten years from the date of grant and vest at a rate of 20% per year beginning
one year after the grant date. Option exercise prices equal the fair market value of the Company stock on the date of the option grant. Options generally are not transferable or assignable other
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. During the grantee lifetime, they may be exercised only by the grantee. 
In
fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase 1,344,000; 1,244,700; and 897,000 shares of common stock, respectively, at prices which ranged from $1497 to

The Company has three reportable segments based on geographic operations: the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific. Each segment markets online integrated database services to
investment managers, investment banks and other financial services professionals. The U.S. segment services financial institutions throughout North America, while the European and Asia Pacific
segments service investment professionals located in Europe and other regions. 
37  The
European segment is headquartered in London, England and maintains office locations in France, Germany, and Italy. The Asia Pacific segment is headquartered in Japan with office locations in Hong
Kong, Australia and Singapore. Mainly sales and consulting personnel staff each of these foreign branch operations. Segment revenues reflect direct sales of products and services to clients based in
their respective geographic locations. There are no intersegment or intercompany sales of the FactSet service. Each segment records compensation, travel, office and other direct expenses related to
its employees. Expenditures related to the Company computing centers, data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the U.S. segment and are not allocated to the European and Asia
Pacific segments. At August31, 2005, total goodwill of $1108million is allocated to the U.S. segment totaling $627million and in the European segment totaling

In fiscal 2005, the Company renewed its three-year credit facility and continued to maintain its existing 364-day revolving credit facility. The credit
facilities the facilities are available in an aggregate principal amount of up to $250million for working capital and general corporate purposes, with the facilities split into two equal
tranches and maturing in March2006 and March2008. Approximately $32million in aggregate of these credit facilities has been utilized for letters of credit issued during the
ordinary course of business as of August31, 2005. The Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facilities at a weighted average annual rate of 0125%. The
facilities also contain covenants that, among other things, require the Company to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. 
15. OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 
In the normal course of business, securities transactions of commission clients of FDS are introduced and cleared through its clearing broker. Pursuant to an agreement between
FDS and its clearing broker, the clearing broker has the right to charge FDS for unsecured losses that result from a client failure to complete such transactions. The Company has never experienced
significant losses and, therefore, has not recorded a liability with regard to the right. The Company seeks to control the credit risk of nonperformance by considering the creditworthiness of its
clients. 
Receivables
from clearing brokers represent a concentration of credit risk in that securities transactions cleared through its clearing broker bear the potential for liability if unwound or
unconsummated. 
Financial
instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of trade accounts receivable. We periodically review our accounts receivable for
collectibility and provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent that amounts are not expected to be collected. No individual client accounted for more than 5% of total subscriptions
and subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not exceed 25% of total client subscriptions. 16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
On September1, 2005, FactSet acquired all the outstanding share capital of StreamVPN Limited now known as FactSet Research Systems Limited, pursuant to a definitive
agreement among FactSet, FactSet Holdings UK Limited, Erik Wstlund and the sellers defined in the agreement, entered into on July27, 2005, as well as pursuant to other similar
purchase agreements with individual minority shareholders. A redacted copy of the definitive agreement was included as Exhibit991 to the Company Form8-K Report filed on
July29, 2005. FactSet paid aggregate consideration of 13,000,000, subject to adjustment based on levels of working capital. In addition, contingent consideration will be payable
if certain subscription targets are met during a twelve-month period following the closing of the transaction.
