Shareholders of Sun Hydraulics Corporation We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Sun Hydraulics Corporation a Florida
corporation as of December25, 2004, and the related statement of operations, shareholders equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Sun Hydraulics Corporation as of December25, 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Tampa, Florida

Corporation Sun Hydraulics, with its main offices located in Sarasota, Florida, designs,
manufactures and sells through independent distributors in the United States and other
international markets. Sun Hydraulik Holdings Limited Sun Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Sun Hydraulics, was formed to provide a holding company for the European market operations; its
wholly-owned subsidiaries are Sun Hydraulics Limited a British corporation, Sun Ltd. and Sun
Hydraulik GmbH a German corporation, Sun GmbH. Sun Ltd. operates a manufacturing and

distribution facility located in Erkelenz, Germany. Sun Hydraulics Korea Corporation Sun
Korea, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Hydraulics, located in Inchon, South Korea, operates a

China, a 50/50 joint venture between Sun Hydraulics and Links Lin, the owner of Sun Hydraulics
Corporations Taiwanese distributor, is located in Shanghai, China, and operates a manufacturing
and distribution facility. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the Companys
consolidated financial statements is set forth below Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Sun Hydraulics and its
direct and indirect subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. The Company uses the equity method of accounting to account for
investments in its joint venture in China in which it does not have a majority ownership or
exercise control. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company currently only applies judgment and estimates, which may have a material effect on the
eventual outcome of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, for impairment of long-lived
assets, accounts receivable, inventory, goodwill and accruals. The following explains the basis
and the procedure for each account where judgment and estimates are applied. Revenue Recognition
The Company reports revenues, net of sales incentives, when title passes and risk of loss transfers
to the customer. The effect of material non-recurring events is provided for when they become
known. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for
Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets SFAS 144, long-lived assets, such as property and
equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future
net cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds its fair market value. The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to
amortization under SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142. See Goodwill
below. 33 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable The Company sells to most of its customers on a recurring basis, primarily through distributors
with which the Company maintains long-term relationships. As a result, bad debt experience has not
been material. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined on a specific identification
basis by a review of those accounts that are significantly in arrears. There can be no assurance
that a distributor or a large direct sale customer with overdue accounts receivable balances will
not develop financial difficulties and default on payment. See balance sheet for allowance
amounts. Inventory The Company offers a wide variety of standard products and as a matter of policy does not
discontinue products. On an ongoing basis, component parts found to be obsolete through design or
process changes are disposed of and charged to material cost. The Company reviews on-hand balances
of products and component parts against specific criteria. Products and component parts without
usage or that have excess quantities on hand are evaluated. An inventory reserve is then
established for the full inventory carrying value of those products and component parts deemed to
be obsolete or slow moving. See Note 5 for inventory reserve amounts. Goodwill The Company acquired its Korean operations in September1998 using the purchase method. As a
result, goodwill is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. A valuation based on the cash
flow method was performed at December25, 2004 and
December27, 2003. It was determined that the
value of the goodwill was not impaired. There is no assurance that the value of the acquired
company will not decrease in the future due to changing business conditions. See Note 7 for
goodwill amounts. Accruals The Company makes estimates related to certain employee benefits and miscellaneous accruals.
Estimates for employee benefit accruals are based on information received from plan administrators
in conjunction with managements assessments of estimated liabilities related to workers
compensation, the 401k plan discretionary match, and health care benefits. Estimates for
miscellaneous accruals are based on managements assessment of estimated liabilities for costs
incurred. As of July1, 2003, the Company accrues for health care benefit costs under a self-funded plan
utilizing estimates provided by a third party administrator and insurance company. The Company
purchases re-insurance for both specific and aggregate stop losses on claims that exceed $75,000 on
an individual basis and approximately $36
million on an aggregate basis. Reclassification Certain amounts shown in the 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified
to conform to the 2004 presentation. Management Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 52 Week Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to the end of the month of December. Each
quarter consists of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period. 34 Table of Contents Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on a first-in,
first-out basis. Obsolete and slow moving inventory is evaluated and reserves are established
based on specific criteria determined by management. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and improvements that
significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.
Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight
line method over the following useful lives

5 - 15
Buildings

Gains or losses on the retirement, sale, or disposition of plant, property, and equipment are
reflected in the Statement of Operations in the period in which the assets are taken out of
service. Valuation Assessment of Long-Lived Assets Management periodically evaluates long-lived assets for potential impairment and will provide for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets
may not be fully recoverable. Assets are reviewed for utilization on a monthly basis by management
in conjunction with employees who work directly with the assets. Goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisition over the fair value of
the net assets acquired and other acquisition costs, is carried at cost, net of accumulated
amortization. Effective January1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142. Under SFAS 142, goodwill
is no longer subject to amortization. Instead, SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be reviewed for
impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible
impairment. Other Assets Other assets consists of an equity investment in the Companys joint venture in China. The equity
investment was recorded at cost and has been adjusted for investment income or loss and dividend
distributions for each quarterly period since its origin. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when products are shipped and title to the products is passed to the customer.
Sales incentives are granted to customers based upon the volume of purchases. These sales
incentives are recorded at the time of sales as a reduction of gross sales. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs billed to distributors and customers are recorded in revenue. Shipping
costs incurred by the Company are recorded in cost of goods sold. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The Company follows the translation policy provided by SFAS No52, Foreign Currency Translation.
The Pound Sterling is the functional currency of Sun Ltd. The Euro is the functional currency of
Sun GmbH. The South Korean Won is the functional currency of Sun Korea. The U.S. Dollar is the
functional currency for Sun Hydraulics and the reporting currency for the consolidated group. The
assets and liabilities of Sun Ltd., Sun GmbH, and Sun Korea are translated at the exchange rate in
effect at the balance sheet date, and income and expense items are 35 Table of Contents translated at the average annual rate of exchange for the period. The resulting unrealized translation gains and losses are
included in the component of shareholders equity designated as accumulated other comprehensive
income. Realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in
miscellaneous incomeexpense. Income Taxes The Company follows the income tax policy provided by SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes
SFAS 109. This Statement provides for a liability approach under which deferred income taxes
are provided for based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the taxes
become payable. These differences result from items reported differently for financial reporting
and income tax purposes, primarily depreciation, accrued expenses and reserves. Stock-Based Compensation The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No123 SFAS 148, and
has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of employee stock options equals the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recorded. If the
company had elected to recognize compensation expense for stock options based on the fair value at
grant date, consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts
below. The pro forma amounts were determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model with weighted
average assumptions as set forth below.

These pro forma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures since the estimated fair
value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period and additional options may
be granted in future years. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. 36 Table of Contents 3. FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, other
current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value, as the interest rates on the debt
approximate rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities. 4. RESTRICTED CASH On December25, 2004 and December27, 2003, the Company had restricted cash of $462 and $425,
respectively. The restricted cash balance consisted of reserves for customs and excise taxes in
the U.K. operation. The restricted amount was calculated as an estimate of two months of customs
and excise taxes for items coming into the Companys U.K. operations and was held with Lloyds TSB
in the U.K. 5. INVENTORIES

The remaining principal payments are due as follows: 2005 $1,058; 2006 $1,475; 2007 $759;
2008 $8,736; 2009 and thereafter $226. On July23, 2003, the Company completed a recapitalization which refinanced existing debt in the
U.S. and further leveraged assets. This new financing consisted of a Term Loan of $11million and
a secured revolving Line of Credit of $12million. The Term Loan and the Line of Credit are
secured by all of the Companys U.S. assets, all Sun Ltd. and Sun Holdings assets excluding real
property and a restricted cash account for $462, and a stock pledge of all authorized and issued
capital stock of Sun GmbH and Sun Korea. The total carrying value of assets held as collateral is
$595million. The Term Loan has monthly principal and interest payments based upon a 20-year
amortization schedule, with all remaining principal and interest due July23, 2008. The Line of
Credit requires monthly payments of interest only, and is payable in full on July23, 2006. Both
the Term Loan and the Line of Credit had a floating interest rate for the first year of 19% over
LIBOR, or the Prime Rate, at the Companys discretion. From and after July2004, the rates will
vary based upon the Companys leverage ratio. At December25, 2004, the Term Loan had an
outstanding balance of $102million and the Line of Credit was fully paid with no outstanding
balance. The Term Loan and the Line of Credit debt covenants including 1 Fixed Charges Coverage Ratio as
defined of 20 to 10, determined quarterly on a rolling four quarters basis, 2 Debt as defined
to Tangible Net Worth as defined of not more than 15 to 10, determined quarterly, 3 Current
Ratio of 15 to 10, determined quarterly, 4 Funded Debt as defined to EBITDA as defined of
less than 325 to 10, determined quarterly on a rolling four quarters basis, and 5 the Companys
primary domestic depository accounts shall be with SouthTrust Bank. As of December25, 2004 and
December27, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. 11. REDEEMABLE COMMON STOCK On June22, 2002, the Company entered into a standby Stock Repurchase Agreement with the Koski
Family Limited Partnership, which owns approximately 34% of the outstanding shares of the Companys
common stock. Robert E. Koski and Christine Koski are Directors of the Company. Under the
Agreement, the Company agreed to purchase up to $2,250,000 worth of Company common stock from the
Koski Partnership on a one time basis, until June22, 2004, at a per share price of the lower of
$700 per share, or 15% less than the average closing price per share of the common stock for the
15 full trading days immediately preceding the closing date. Upon entering into 39 Table of Contents the Agreement, $2,250 was transferred from Capital in Excess of Par into Redeemable Common Stock on the balance
sheet.
Effective third quarter 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. The standard requires the Company
to classify certain financial instruments as a liability or an asset at fair value. Management has
determined that the estimated fair value of the put option is not material and has transferred
$2,250 from Redeemable Common Stock to Capital in Excess of Par on the balance sheet. The Agreement expired in June2004 and the Company did not purchase any shares from the Koski
Partnership during its term. 12. DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS The Company declared dividends of $1,482, $14,404, and $1,029 to shareholders in 2004, 2003,
and 2002, respectively. The Company declared quarterly dividends of $004, $005, $005, and $0075 per share to
shareholders of record on the last day of the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2004,
respectively, and $004 per share each calendar quarter in 2003 and 2002. These dividends were
paid on the 15th day of each month following the date of declaration. In addition, the
Company paid a special dividend of $200 per share totaling $133million on August18, 2003. 40 Table of Contents   13.

A valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported is required if, based on the weight of the
evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For the
fiscal years ended 2004 and 2003, management has determined that a valuation allowance is not required.
The foreign tax credit carryforward will expire in year 2008. 14. STOCK OPTION PLANS During 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan, which
provides for the grant of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options for the purchase
of up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock by officers, employees and
Directors of the Company. Under the terms of the plan, incentive stock options may be granted to
employees at an exercise price per share of not less than the fair value per common share on the
date of the grant not less than 110% of the fair value in the case of holders of more than 10% of
the Companys voting stock. Nonqualified stock options may be granted at the discretion of the
Companys Board of Directors. The maximum term of an option may not exceed 10years, and options
become exercisable at such times and in such installments as determined by the Board of Directors. 42 Table of Contents A summary of the Companys stock option plan for the years ended December25, 2004, December27,

The weighted average
estimated fair value of stock options granted during 2004, 2003 and
2002 was $480, $146, and $169 per share, respectively.
During 2001, the Company adopted the 2001 Restricted Stock Plan, which provides for the grant of
restricted stock of up to an aggregate of 275,000 shares of the Companys common stock to officers,
employees, consultants and directors of the Company. Under the terms of the plan, the minimum
period before any shares become non-forfeitable may not be less than six months. The market value
of the restricted stock at the date of grant was recorded as unearned compensation, a component of
shareholders equity, and is being charged to expense over the respective vesting periods.
Restricted stock expense for the years ended December25, 2004, December27, 2003, and December28,
2002 totaled $250, $181, and $180, respectively. 43 Table of Contents On September6, 2003, the Board of Directors granted restricted stock to employees who held
outstanding options as of that date. The purpose of the grant was to compensate option holders for
the decrease in value of the Companys stock attributable to the payment of the special dividend,
which the Board determined to be approximately $100. To provide a continuing incentive to these
employees, the restricted stock will be earned over a one to three year period. The restricted
stock is expensed over the vesting period at a price of $741, the stock price on September5,
2003. On October15, 2004, the Board of Directors granted 23,756 shares of restricted stock to employees.
The restricted stock will be earned over a three year period. The restricted stock is expensed
over the vesting period at a price of $1235, the stock price on October15, 2004. The grant
increased restricted shares outstanding from 129,900 at December27, 2003 to 153,656 at December
25, 2004. At December25, 2004 and December27, 2003, 67,374 and 33,983 of these shares,
respectively, were vested. During 2001, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, which became effective
August1, 2001. Most employees are eligible to participate. Employees who choose to participate
are granted an opportunity to purchase common stock at 85percent of market value on the first or
last day of the quarterly purchase period, whichever is lower. The ESPP authorizes the issuance,
and the purchase by employees, of up to 325,000 shares of common stock through payroll deductions.
No employee is allowed to buy more than $25,000 of common stock in any year, based on the market
value of the common stock at the beginning of the purchase period. Employees purchased
approximately 13,342 shares at an average price of $862 and 14,984 shares at an average price of
$615, under the ESPP during 2004 and 2003, respectively. At December25, 2004 and December27,
2003, 282,632 and 295,974 shares, respectively, remained available to be issued through the ESPP. During 2004, the Board of
Directors adopted and the shareholders approved the Nonemployee
Director Equity and Deferred Compensation Plan the
Plan. Directors who are not officers of the Company are
paid $4,000 for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors,
as well as each meeting of each Board Committee on which they serve
when the committee meeting is not held within one day of a meeting of
the Board of Directors. Directors receive $1,500 of the $4,000
Director fee in shares of Company stock under the Plan. Directors
also may elect under the plan to receive all or part of the remainder
of their fees in Company stock and to defer receipt of their fees
until a subsequent year. The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to
80,000shares of common stock. Directors were granted
2,741shares during 2004. At December25, 2004,
77,259shares remained available to be issued through the Plan. 15. STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN On November29, 2004, The Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $25
million of Company common stock to be completed no later than January15, 2006. Stock will be
repurchased periodically in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in
accordance with the Stock Repurchase Plan. Market purchases will be made subject to
restrictions relating to volume, price and timing in an effort to minimize the impact of the
purchases on the market for the Companys securities. The repurchased shares are retired and added
to the Companys authorized, but unissued, shares. The amount of the stock repurchases was set based upon the anticipated number of shares that will
be required to fund the Companys employee stock ownership plan and employee stock purchase plan
through fiscal year 2005. In 2004, the Company repurchased 5,800 shares totaling approximately
$82,800 under the Plan at an average price per share of $1428. 44 Table of Contents 16. EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table represents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share as

United States employees. Employer contributions under the retirement plan amounted to
approximately $2,346, $686, and $685 during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The Company provides supplemental pension benefits to its employees of foreign operations in
addition to mandatory benefits included in local country payroll tax statutes. These supplemental
pension benefits amounted to approximately $437, $266, and $235 during 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. In June2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved the establishment of an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan ESOP as the discretionary match portion of its 401k retirement plan. Prior to
2004, discretionary matches to the 401k plan were made in cash. The Company contributes to the
ESOP for all eligible United States employees. Under the ESOP, which is 100% company funded, the
Company allocates common stock to each participants account. The allocation is generally a
percentage of a participants compensation as determined by the Board of Directors on an annual
basis. The ESOP is accounted for under Statement of Position 93-6 Employers Accounting for
Employee Stock Ownership Plans. In September2004, the Company made a one-time contribution of 32,000 shares of its common stock to
the ESOP. In January2005, 73,290 shares were contributed to the ESOP based on 2004 compensation.
All shares receive regular quarterly dividends payable to the ESOP to cover plan expenses. The Company incurred compensation expense under the ESOP of approximately $1,572 during 2004.
There was no discretionary match to the 401k in 2003 and 2002. Shares contributed to the ESOP are restricted for one year. Participants may then sell their
shares to enable diversification within their individual 401k accounts. The Company does not
have any repurchase obligations under the ESOP. 45 Table of Contents 18. SEGMENT REPORTING The individual subsidiaries comprising the Company operate predominantly in a single industry as

INSURANCE On July1, 2003, the Company changed its group health insurance plan that covers U.S.
employees and their families from a fully-insured policy to a self-funded plan. The Company
purchases re-insurance for both specific and aggregate stop losses on claims that exceed $75,000 on
an individual basis and approximately $36million on an aggregate basis. The Company records a liability for all unresolved claims at the anticipated cost to the Company at
the end of the period based on the estimates provided by a third party administrator and insurance
company, plus an estimate for amounts incurred but not recorded. The Company believes it has
adequate reserves for all self-insurance claims. 20. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No51 ARB 51. FIN 46 provides guidance in determining 1whether
consolidation is required under the controlling financial interest model of ARB 51 or 2whether
the variable interest model under FIN 46 should be used to account for existing and new entities.
In December2003, the FASB released a revised version of FIN 46 FIN 46R clarifying certain
aspects of FIN 46 and providing certain entities with exemptions from its requirements. The
Company uses the equity method of accounting to account for investments in its joint venture in
China in which it does not have a majority ownership or exercise control. The Company does not
believe that its investment in the China Joint Venture is a variable interest entity and within the
scope of FIN 46 and FIN 46R, and therefore does not have a material effect on the Companys
financial statements. In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151 SFAS 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB
No43, Chapter4. The amendments made by SFAS 151 clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials spoilageshould be recognized as
current-period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based
on the normal capacity of the production facilities. While SFAS 151 enhances Accounting Research
Bulletin No43, Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins, and clarifies the
accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted
material spoilage, the statement also removes inconsistencies between ARB 43 and International
Accounting Standards No2 IAS 2 and amends ARB 43 to clarify that abnormal amounts of costs
should be recognized as period costs. Under some circumstances, according to ARB 43, the above
listed costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges. SFAS 151
requires these items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the
criterion of so abnormal and requires allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
conversion. This standard will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after
June15, 2005. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 151 on the Companys reported operating results,
financial position and existing financial statement disclosure is not expected to be material. 47 Table of Contents In December, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 revised 2004 SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment,
which is a revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. SFAS
123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB 25, SFAS 123, and amends SFAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows. This Statement
requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of
equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions.
This Statement eliminates the alternative to use APB 25s intrinsic value
method of accounting that was provided in SFAS 123 as originally issued. Under APB 25, issuing
stock options to employees generally resulted in recognition of no compensation cost. SFAS 123R also requires that the Company estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest
and to revise the estimate as the actual forfeitures differ from the estimate. This standard is
effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after
June15, 2005. The effect of these items and other changes in SFAS 123R as well as the
potential impact on the Companys reported operating results, financial position and existing
financial statement disclosure is currently being evaluated. SFAS 123R requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost
be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow; thus, reducing net
operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in the periods after the effective
date. The Company cannot estimate what these amounts will be in the future because they
depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options. The amount of operating cash
flow recognized in 2004 for such excess tax deductions for stock-based compensation was
approximately $290,000. There was no effect on operating cash flows for such excess tax deductions
during 2003 and 2002. The Company currently follows the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and has elected to follow APB 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. The Company uses the Black-Scholes
formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees for disclosure purposes. SFAS
123R requires that we use the valuation technique that best fits the circumstances. The Company
is currently evaluating other techniques. In December2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP 109-1 FSP 109-1 and 109-2 FSP
109-2. FSP 109-1 provides guidance on the application of SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes SFAS 109, with regard to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provision
within H.R. 4520, The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 Act, that was enacted on October22,
2004. FSP 109-2 provides guidance on a special one-time dividends received deduction on the
repatriation of certain foreign earnings to qualifying U.S. taxpayers. The Act contains numerous
provisions related to corporate and international taxation including repeal of the Extraterritorial
Income ETIregime, creation of a new Domestic Production Activities DPAdeduction and a
temporary dividends received deduction related to repatriation of foreign earnings. The Act
contains various effective dates and transition periods. Under the guidance provided in FSP 109-1,
the new DPA deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in SFAS 109. As such,
the special deduction has no effect on the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities existing
at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which
the deduction is claimed on the Companys income tax return. The repeal of ETI and its replacement
with a DPA deduction were not in effect in 2004 and, therefore, did not have an effect on the
income tax provision for the year ended December25, 2004. The Company does not expect the net
effect of the phase-out of the ETI deduction and phase-in of the new DPA deduction to result in a
material impact on its effective income tax rate in 2005. In FSP 109-2, the FASB acknowledged that, due to the proximity of the Acts enactment date to many
companies year-ends and the fact that numerous provisions within the Act are complex and pending
further regulatory guidance, many companies might not be in a position to assess the impacts of the
Act on their plans for repatriation or reinvestment of foreign earnings. Therefore, the FSP
provided companies with a practical exception to the permanent reinvestment standards of SFAS 109
and APB No23, Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas, by providing additional time to
determine the amount of earnings, if any, that they intend to repatriate under the Acts
provisions. The Company is not yet in a position to decide whether, and to what extent, it might
repatriate foreign earnings to the U.S. Therefore, under the guidance provided in FSP 109-2, no
deferred tax liability has been recorded in 2004 in connection with the repatriation provisions of
the Act. The Company is currently analyzing the future impact of the temporary dividends received
deduction provisions contained in the Act. 48 Table of Contents
