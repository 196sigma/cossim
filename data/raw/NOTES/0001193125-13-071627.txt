REPORTING  Management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and board of directors of the Company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.  Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation
and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures
may deteriorate.  We assessed the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2012. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2012 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included on page 57.

GOODRICH PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTE 1Description of Business and Accounting Policies 
Goodrich Petroleum Corporation together
with its subsidiary, we, our, or the Company is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas on properties primarily in iSouth
Texas, which includes the Eagle Ford Shale Trend, iiNorthwest Louisiana and East Texas, which includes the Haynesville Shale and Cotton Valley Taylor Sand, and iiiSouthwest Mississippi and Southeast Louisiana, which includes the
Tuscaloosa Marine Shale.  Principles of
ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements of the Company are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC and
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Goodrich Petroleum Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary. Intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation. Certain data in prior
periods financial statements have been adjusted to conform to the presentation of the current period. We have evaluated subsequent events through the date of this filing. 
Use of EstimatesOur Management has made a number
of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP. 
Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposit accounts and temporary cash investments with maturities of ninety days or less at date of purchase. 
Restricted CashRestricted cash held in escrow at December31, 2010 totaling $42 million was paid out in 2011 for the
posting of the suspensive appeal bond relating to the Hoover Tree Farm, LLC v. Goodrich Petroleum Company, LLC, et al. litigation. None of the cash was restricted as of December31, 2011 or December31, 2012. See Note 9. 
Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe routinely
assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability. Many of our receivables are from a limited number of purchasers. Accordingly, accounts receivable from such purchases could be significant.
Generally, our natural gas and crude oil receivables are collected within thirty to sixty days of production. We also have receivables from joint interest owners of properties we operate. We may have the ability to withhold future revenue
disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint interest billings.  We accrue a reserve on a receivable when, based on the judgment of management, it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of the reserve may be reasonably estimated. As of each
of December31, 2012 and 2011, our allowance for doubtful accounts was immaterial.  InventoryInventory consists of casing and tubulars that are expected to be used in our capital drilling program and oil in storage tanks. Inventory is carried on the Balance Sheet at the
lower of cost or market.  Property and
EquipmentWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and development expenditures. Under this method, costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and natural gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. When proved
reserves are found on an unproved property, the associated leasehold cost is transferred to proved properties. Significant unproved leases are reviewed periodically, and a 
63 Table of Contents GOODRICH PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
valuation allowance is provided for any estimated decline in value. Costs of all other unproved leases are amortized over the estimated average holding period of the leases. Development costs are
capitalized, including the costs of unsuccessful development wells.  ExplorationExploration expenditures, including geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells are
initially capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the discovery. If management determines that commercial quantities of hydrocarbons have not been discovered, capitalized costs associated with exploratory
wells are expensed.  Fair Value
MeasurementFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of an asset should reflect
its highest and best use by market participants, whether in-use or an in-exchange valuation premise. The fair value of a liability should reflect the risk of nonperformance, which includes, among other things, our credit risk. 
We use various methods, including the income approach and
market approach, to determine the fair values of our financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which depend on a number of factors, including the availability of observable market data over the contractual term of
the underlying instrument. For some of our instruments, the fair value is calculated based on directly observable market data or data available for similar instruments in similar markets. For other instruments, the fair value may be calculated based
on these inputs as well as other assumptions related to estimates of future settlements of these instruments. We separate our financial instruments into three levels levels 1, 2 and 3 based on our assessment of the availability of observable
market data and the significance of non-observable data used to determine the fair value of our instruments. Our assessment of an instrument can change over time based on the maturity or liquidity of the instrument, which could result in a change in
the classification of the instruments between levels.  Each of these levels and our corresponding instruments classified by level are further described below:  Level 1 Inputsunadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Included in this level is our Senior Notes;
Level 2 Inputsquotes which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Included in this level are our Senior Credit
Facility and commodity derivatives whose fair values are based on third-party quotes or available interest rate information and commodity pricing data obtained from third party pricing sources and our creditworthiness or that of our counterparties;
and  Level 3 Inputsunobservable inputs for the asset or liability, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations, based on our various assumptions
and future commodity prices. Included in this level are our oil and natural gas properties which are deemed impaired. 
As of December31, 2012 and 2011, the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables represented
fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.  ImpairmentWe periodically assess our long-lived assets recorded in oil and natural gas properties on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to ensure that they are not carried in excess of fair
value, which is computed using level 3 inputs such as discounted cash flow models or valuations, based on estimated future commodity prices and our various operational assumptions. An evaluation is performed on a field-by-field basis at least
annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that our oil and natural gas properties may be impaired. 
64 Table of Contents GOODRICH PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
As of December31, 2012, we had interests in oil and natural gas properties
totaling $7183 million, net of accumulated depletion, which we account for under the successful efforts method.The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair-value calculations are based on judgmental assessments
of future production volumes, prices, and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. Due to the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if additional future impairment charges will be recorded. We
estimated future net cash flows generated from our oil and natural gas properties by using forecasted oil and natural gas prices published by the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX. 
We determined during 2012 that the carrying amount of certain
of our oil and natural gas properties were not recoverable from future cash flows and, therefore, we recorded an impairment of $478 million for the year ended December31, 2012. These impairment charges reduced the fields carrying value
to an estimated fair value of $33 million as of December31, 2012.  Total impairment associated with our oil and natural gas properties for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010 was $81 million and $2349 million, respectively. 
DepreciationDepreciation and depletion of
producing oil and natural gas properties is calculated using the units-of-production method. Proved developed reserves are used to compute unit rates for unamortized tangible and intangible development costs, and proved reserves are used for
unamortized leasehold costs.  Gains and losses on
disposals or retirements that are significant or include an entire depreciable or depletable property unit are included in operating income. Depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment, consisting of office furniture, computer hardware and
software and leasehold improvements, is computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which vary from three to five years. 
Transportation ObligationWe entered into a natural gas gathering agreement with an independent service provider, effective
July27, 2010. The agreement is scheduled to remain in effect for a period of ten years and requires the service provider to construct pipelines and facilities to connect our wells to the service providers gathering system in our Eagle
Ford Shale Trend area of South Texas. In compensation for the services, we agreed to pay the service provider 110 percent of the total capital cost incurred by the service provider to construct new pipelines and facilities. The service provider
bills us for 20 percent of the accumulated unpaid capital costs annually.  We accounted for the agreement by recording a long-term asset, included in Deferred financing cost and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The asset is being amortized using the
units-of-production method and the amortization expense is included in Transportation on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The related current and long-term liabilities are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in
Accrued liabilities and Transportation obligation, respectively.  Asset Retirement ObligationsWe follow the accounting standard related to accounting for asset retirement obligations. These obligations are related to the abandonment and site restoration
requirements that result from the acquisition, construction and development of our oil and gas properties. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase
in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Accretion expense is included in depreciation, depletion and amortization on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
Revenue RecognitionOil and natural gas revenues
are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred, and if collectability of the revenue is probable. Revenues from the production of crude oil and natural gas
properties in which we have an 
65 Table of Contents GOODRICH PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
interest with other producers are recognized using the entitlements method. We record a liability or an asset for natural gas balancing when we have sold more or less than our working interest
share of natural gas production, respectively. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the net liability for natural gas balancing was immaterial. Differences between actual production and net working interest volumes are routinely adjusted. 
Derivative InstrumentsWe use derivative
instruments such as futures, forwards, options, collars and swaps for purposes of hedging our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas and to hedge our exposure to changing interest rates. Accounting standards related to
derivative instruments and hedging activities require that all derivative instruments subject to the requirements of those standards be measured at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. We offset the fair value of
our asset and liability positions with the same counterparty for each commodity type. Changes in fair value are required to be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We have not designated any of our derivative
contracts as hedges, accordingly; changes in fair value are reflected in earnings.  Income TaxesWe account for income taxes, as required, under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
We recognize, as required, the financial statement benefit of
an uncertain tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial
statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. 
Earnings Per ShareBasic income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders for each
reporting period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders for each reporting period by the weighted average

Concentration of Credit RiskDue to the nature of the industry, we sell our
oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and, accordingly, amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant. The revenues compared to our total oil and natural gas revenues from the top purchasers for the years

CompensationWe account for our share-based transactions using fair value and recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of each option award is estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model
with various assumptions based on our estimates. Our assumptions include expected volatility, expected term of option, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. Expected volatility estimates are developed by us based on historical volatility of
our stock. We use historical data to estimate the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the grant date. Our common stock does not
pay dividends; therefore, the dividend yield is zero. The fair value of restricted stock is measured using the close of the day stock price on the day of the award. 
GuaranteeOn March2, 2011, we issued and
sold $275,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our 8875% Senior Notes due 2019 the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Goodrich Petroleum Company, L.L.C. 
Goodrich Petroleum Corporation, as the parent company the
Parent Company, has no independent assets or operations. The guarantee is full and unconditional, and the Parent Company has no other subsidiaries. In addition, there are no restrictions on the ability of the Parent Company to obtain
funds from its subsidiary by dividend or loan. Finally, the Parent Companys wholly-owned subsidiary does not have restricted assets that exceed 25% of net assets as of the most recent fiscal year end that may not be transferred to the Parent
Company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends by the subsidiary without the consent of a third party. 
New Accounting Pronouncements 
ASU 2011-04 Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
and IFRS.In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued additional guidance intended to result in convergence between USGAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
IFRS requirements for measurement of and disclosures about fair value. The amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on companies applying US GAAP. Principal provisions of the amendments include: iapplication of
the highest and best use is relevant only when measuring fair value for non-financial assets and liabilities; iia prohibition on grouping financial instruments for purposes of determining fair value, except when an entity manages
market and credit risks on the basis of the entitys net exposure to the group; iiian extension of the prohibition against the use of a blockage factor to all fair value measurements that prohibition currently applies only to financial
instruments with quoted prices in active markets; ivguidance that fair value measurement of equity instruments should be made from the perspective of a market participant that holds that instrument as an asset; and va requirement
that for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, entities disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs, a 
67 Table of Contents GOODRICH PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
description of the valuation process used and qualitative details about the sensitivity of the measurements. In addition, for Balance Sheet items not carried at fair value but for which fair
value is disclosed, entities will be required to disclose the Level within the fair value hierarchy that applies to the fair value measurement disclosed. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December15,
2011. We have adopted this guidance effective January1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys fair value measurements, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
ASU 2011-05 Comprehensive Income: Presentation of
Comprehensive IncomeIn June 2011, the FASB issued guidance intended to eliminate the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. ASU 2011-05 requires that all non-owner
changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This new guidance is to be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods
beginning after December15, 2011. The adoption of this guidance does not have an impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
ASU 2011-11 Balance Sheet: Disclosures about
Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance intended to result in convergence between USGAAP and IFRS requirements for offsetting netting assets and liabilities presented in the statements of
financial position. The guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The
disclosure affects all entities with financial instruments and derivatives that are either offset on the balance sheet in accordance with ASC 210-20-45 or ASC 815-10-45, or subject to a master netting arrangement, irrespective of whether they are
offset on the balance sheet. This information will enable users of an entitys financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entitys financial position, including the effect or potential
effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods. Entities
should provide the disclosures required by this ASU retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We will adopt this guidance effective January1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the
Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
NOTE 2Share-Based Compensation Plans 
Overview 
At our annual meeting of stockholders in May 2006, our
shareholders approved our 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2006 Plan. The 2006 Plan provides for grants to employees and non-employee directors. Under the 2006 Plan, a maximum of 20million new shares are reserved for issuance
as awards of share options to officers, employees and non-employee directors. In May 2011, our shareholders amended the 2006 Plan to increase the maximum number of new shares reserved for issuance as awards of share options to officers, employees
and non-employee directors by 20 million. As of December31, 2012, a total of 855,142 shares were available for future grants under the 2006 Plan. 
The 2006 Plan is intended to promote the interests of the Company by providing a means by which employees, consultants and directors may
acquire or increase their equity interest in the Company and may develop a sense of proprietorship and personal involvement in the development and financial success of the Company, and to encourage them to remain with and devote their best efforts
to the business of the Company, thereby advancing the interests of the Company and its stockholders. The 2006 Plan is also intended to enhance the ability of the Company and its Subsidiary to attract and retain the services of individuals who are
essential for the growth and profitability of the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The 2006 Plan provides that the Compensation Committee shall have the authority to
determine the participants to whom stock options, restricted stock, performance awards, phantom shares and stock appreciation rights may be granted. 
We measure the cost of stock based compensation granted, including stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of the
award as of the grant date, net of estimated forfeitures. Awards granted are valued at fair value and recognized on a straight-line basis over the service periods or the vesting periods of each award. We estimate forfeiture rates for all unvested
awards based on our historical experience.  The
following table summarizes the pretax components of our share-based compensation programs recorded, recognized as a component of general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in thousands: Year Ended December31 2012 2011 2010 Restricted stock expense 6,670 6,194 5,944 Stock option expense 233 301 1,609 Director stock expense 585 525 502

Stock Options 
The 2006 Plan provides that the option price of shares
issued be equal to the market price on the date of grant. With the exception of option grants to non-employee directors, which vest immediately, options vest ratably on the anniversary of the date of grant over a period of time, typically three
years. All options expire ten years after the date of grant.  Option activity under our stock option plans as of December31, 2012, and changes during the year ended December31, 2012 were as follows: Shares WeightedAverageExercisePrice RemainingContractualTerm AggregateIntrinsicValue years thousands Outstanding at January1, 2012 914,134 2149 395 74 Granted Exercised 4,000 411 Forfeited 9,150 2159

all option holders exercised their options on December31, 2012. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of our stock. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended
December31, 2012, and 2010 was less than $01 million in both years. There were not any exercised in 2011.  Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Range of Exercise Prices

model Black-Scholes.  The following

Restricted Stock 
In 2003, we began granting a series of restricted stock
awards. Restricted stock awarded under the 2006 Plan typically has a vesting period of three years. During the vesting period, ownership of the shares cannot be transferred and the shares are subject to forfeiture if employment ends before the end
of the vesting period. Certain restricted stock awards provide for accelerated vesting. Restricted shares are not considered to be currently issued and outstanding until the restrictions lapse and/or they vest.

February25, 2011, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Senior Credit Facility. The primary conditions for the effectiveness of the Fourth Amendment were ithe closing of the issuance and sale of our 8875% Notes due 2019 the
2019 Notes, and iithe placement of not less than $175 million of net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Notes in an escrow account with the lenders to be used for the redemption or earlier repurchase of all our outstanding 325%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 the 2026 Notes, both of which occurred on March2, 2011.

Total lender commitments under the Senior Credit Facility are $600 million subject to
borrowing base limitations as of December31, 2012 of $210million. The Senior Credit Facility matures on July1, 2014 subject to automatic extension to February25, 2016, if, prior to maturity, we prepay or escrow certain
proceeds sufficient to prepay our $2185 million 5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 the 2029 Notes. Revolving borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are limited to, and subject to, periodic redeterminations of the borrowing
base. Interest on revolving borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility accrues at a rate calculated, at our option, at the bank base rate plus 100% to 175%, or LIBOR plus 200% to 275%, depending on borrowing base utilization. Pursuant to the
terms of the Senior Credit Facility, borrowing base redeterminations occur on a semi-annual basis on April1 and October1. As of December31, 2012, we had $95 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility. Substantially all
our assets are pledged as collateral to secure the Senior Credit Facility.  The terms of the Senior Credit Facility require us to maintain certain covenants. Capitalized terms used here, but not defined, have the meanings assigned to them in the Senior Credit Facility. In October
2011, we entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Senior Credit Facility which amended the EBITDAX annualized calculation and increased the borrowing base to $210 million. The primary financial covenants include:  Current Ratio of 10/10;  Ratio of EBITDAX to cash Interest Expense of not less than 25/10 for the trailing four quarters; and  Total Debt no greater than 40 times EBITDAX for the trailing four quarters.  As used in connection with the Senior Credit Facility, Current Ratio is consolidated current assets including
current availability under the Senior Credit Facility, but excluding non-cash assets related to our derivatives to consolidated current liabilities excluding non-cash assets related to our derivatives, accrued capital expenditures and current
maturities under the Senior Credit Facility.  As
defined in the credit agreement EBITDAX is earnings before interest expense, income tax, DDA, exploration expense, stock based compensation and impairment of oil and natural gas properties. In calculating EBITDAX for this purpose, earnings
include realized gains losses from derivatives not designated as hedges but exclude unrealized gains losses from derivatives not designated as hedges. 
We were in compliance with all the financial covenants of the Senior Credit Facility as of December31, 2012. 
8875% Senior Notes due 2019

Senior Notes 2019 Notes the 2019 Notes. The 2019 Notes mature on March15, 2019, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The 2019 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all of our other
existing and future indebtedness. The 2019 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 8875% annually, and interest is paid semi-annually in arrears on March15 and September15. The 2019 Notes are guaranteed by our subsidiary that also guarantees
our Senior Credit Facility.  Before March15,
2014, we may on one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes at a redemption price of 108875% of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the
net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. On or after March15, 2015, we may redeem all or a portion of the 2019 Notes at redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount equal to i104438% for the twelve-month

price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 
The indenture governing the 2019 Notes restricts our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to: iincur additional

governing the 2019 Notes has occurred and is continuing, many of these covenants will terminate.  5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029  In September 2009, we sold $2185 million of 2029 Notes. The notes mature on October1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The notes are our senior unsecured obligations and
rank equally in right of payment to all of our other existing and future indebtedness. The notes accrue interest at a rate of 5% annually, and interest is paid semi-annually in arrears on April1 and October1 of each year, beginning in
2010. Interest began accruing on the notes on September28, 2009.  Before October1, 2014, we may not redeem the notes. On or after October1, 2014, we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash, and the investors may require us to repurchase the notes
on each of October1, 2014, 2019 and 2024. Upon conversion, we have the option to deliver shares at the applicable conversion rate, redeem in cash or in certain circumstances redeem in a combination of cash and shares. 
Investors may convert their notes at their option at any time
prior to the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the maturity date under the following circumstances: 1during any fiscal quarter and only during such fiscal quarter commencing after December31, 2009, if
the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 135% of the conversion price of the notes as defined in this prospectus supplement for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the
last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter; 2prior to October1, 2014, during the five business-day period after any ten consecutive trading-day period the measurement period in which the trading price of $1,000
principal amount of notes for each trading day in the measurement period was less than 97% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on such trading day; 3if the notes have been called for
redemption; or 4upon the occurrence of one of the specified corporate transactions described in this prospectus supplement. Investors may also convert their notes at their option at any time beginning on September1, 2029, and ending at
the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the maturity date.  The notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a rate equal to 288534 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $3466
per share of common stock per share.  Proceeds
received from the issuance of the 2029 Notes were used, in part, to fully pay-off a second lien term loan of $75 million and for general corporate purposes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
We separately account for the liability and equity components of our 2029 Notes in a
manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest is recognized in subsequent periods. Upon issuance of the notes in September 2009, in accordance with accounting standards related to convertible debt instruments that may be
settled in cash upon conversion, we recorded a debt discount of $494 million, thereby reducing the carrying the value of $2185 million notes on the December31, 2009 balance sheet to $1711 million and recorded an equity component net of tax
of $321 million. The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest rate method based upon an original five year term through October1, 2014. At December31, 2012, $203 million debt discount remains to be amortized on the 2029
notes.  325% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026
During the year ended December31,
2011, we repurchased $1746 million of our 2026 Notes using a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of our 2019 Notes. We recorded a $01 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase for the year ended
December31, 2011. At December31, 2011, $04 million of the 2026 Notes remained outstanding. Holders may present to us for redemption the remaining outstanding 2026 Notes on December1, 2016 and December1, 2021. Upon
conversion, we have the option to deliver shares at the applicable conversion rate, redeem in cash or in certain circumstances redeem in a combination of cash and shares. 
The notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at
a rate equal to the sum of:  a
151653 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes equal to a base conversion price of approximately $6594 per share plus b
an additional amount of shares per $1,000 of principal amount of notes equal to the incremental share factor 26762, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which

The valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets increased by $293 million in 2012. In determining the carrying value of a deferred tax asset, accounting standards provide for the weighing of evidence in estimating whether and how much of a deferred tax asset may be
recoverable. As we have incurred net operating losses in 2012 and prior years, relevant accounting guidance suggests that cumulative losses in recent years constitute significant negative evidence, and that future expectations about income are
insufficient to overcome a history of such losses. Therefore, with the before-mentioned adjustment of $293 million, we have reduced the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset to zero. The valuation allowance has no impact on our net operating
loss NOL position for tax purposes, and if we generate taxable income in future periods, we will be able to use our NOLs to offset taxes due at that time. We will continue to assess the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets
considering all available evidence obtained in future reporting periods.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
As of December31, 2012, we have federal NOL carry-forwards of approximately $4501
million for tax purposes which begin to expire in 2026. We also have an alternative minimum tax credit carry-forward not subject to expiration of $13 million which will not begin to be used until after the available NOLs have been used or expired
and when regular tax exceeds the current year alternative minimum tax.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits did not materially change as of December31, 2012. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change in the next twelve months; however we do not expect the
change to have a significant impact on our results of operations or our financial position. We file a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States and various combined and separate filings in several state and local jurisdictions.
With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2006. 
Our continuing practice is to recognize estimated interest
and penalties related to potential underpayment on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We do not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change
due to the settlement of audits and the expiration of statute of limitations before December31, 2013. 
NOTE 7Stockholders Equity 
Share Lending Agreement
In connection with the offering of our 2026
Notes in December 2006, we lent an affiliate of Bear, Stearns Co. BSC a total of 3,122,263 shares of our common stock under the Share Lending Agreement. On March20, 2008, BSC returned 1,497,963 shares of the 3,122,263
originally borrowed shares and fully collateralized the remaining 1,624,300 borrowed shares with a cash collateral deposit of approximately $413 million. 
In conjunction with the partial repurchase of our 2026 Notes in March 2011, the Share Lending Agreement was terminated and JP Morgan
Chase Co. successor to BSC returned the remaining 1,624,300 shares. The shares returned to us were recorded as treasury shares and retired in March 2011.
Capped Call Option Transactions 
On December10, 2007, we closed the public offering of
6,430,750 shares of our common stock at a price of $2350 per share. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $1454 million after deducting the underwriters discount and estimated offering expenses. We used approximately $1238
million of the net proceeds to pay off outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility, and approximately $216 million of the net proceeds to purchase capped call options on shares of our common stock from affiliates of BSC and
J.P.Morgan Securities Inc.  The capped call
option agreements were separate transactions entered into by us with the option counterparties and was not part of the offering of common stock. The capped call option transactions covered, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments,
approximately 58million shares of our common stock, and each of them was divided into a number of tranches with differing expiration dates. Approximately 77,333 options per trading day expired over each of three separate 25 consecutive
trading day settlement periods. During 2009, two-thirds of the options expired. The remaining one-third of the options subject to the capped call expired in May and June 2010 and did not result in our receipt of any shares of common stock.

Preferred Stock  Our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock was initially
issued on December21, 2005, in a private placement of 1,650,000 shares for net proceeds of $798million after offering costs of $27million. Each share of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of
$50 per share, aggregating to $825 million, and bears a dividend of 5375%per annum. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears beginning March15, 2006. If we fail to pay dividends on our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock on any six
dividend payment dates, whether or not consecutive, the dividend rate per annum will be increased by 10% until we have paid all dividends on our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for all dividend periods up to and including the dividend payment
date on which the accumulated and unpaid dividends are paid in full.  On January23, 2006, the initial purchasers of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 600,000 shares at the same price per share,
resulting in net proceeds of $290 million, which was used to fund our 2006 capital expenditure program. 
Each share is convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at any time at an initial conversion rate of 15946 shares of
common stock per share, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $3136 per share of common stock. Upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, we may choose to deliver the conversion value to holders in
cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock.  If a fundamental change occurs, holders may require us in specified circumstances to repurchase all or part of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental
change or specified corporate events, we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock. A fundamental change will be deemed to have occurred if any of the following occurs:
We consolidate or merge with or into any person or convey, transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of or lease all or substantially all of our assets to
any person, or any person consolidates with or merges into us or with us, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which our outstanding voting shares are changed into or exchanged for cash, securities, or other property; or
We are liquidated or dissolved or adopt a plan of liquidation or dissolution. 
A fundamental change will not be deemed to have
occurred if at least 90% of the consideration in the case of a merger or consolidation under the first clause above consists of common stock traded on a U.S. national securities exchange and the Series B Preferred Stock becomes convertible solely
into such common stock.  On or after
December21, 2010, we may, at our option, cause the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into the number of shares of common stock that are issuable at the then-prevailing conversion rate, pursuant to the Company
Conversion Option. We may exercise our conversion right only if, for 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the announcement of our exercise of the option, the closing price of the common
stock equals or exceeds 130% of the then-prevailing conversion price of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is non-redeemable by us. There have been no redemptions or conversions in any periods.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  NOTE 8Derivative Activities 
We use commodity and financial derivative
contracts to manage fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates. We are currently not designating our derivative contracts for hedge accounting. All gains and losses both realized and unrealized from our derivative contracts have been
recognized in other income expense on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The following table summarizes the realized and unrealized gains and losses we recognized on our oil and natural gas derivatives for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Total gain on oil and natural gas derivatives 31,882 34,539 55,296 
Commodity Derivative
Activity  We enter into swap contracts,
costless collars or other derivative agreements from time to time to manage commodity price risk for a portion of our production. Our policy is that all hedged are approved by the Hedging Committee of our Board of Directors, and reviewed
periodically by the entire Board of Directors. As of December31, 2012, the commodity derivatives we used were in the form of:  a
swaps, where we receive a fixed price and pay a floating price, based on NYMEX or specific transfer point quoted prices, and b
swaptions, where we grant the counter party the right but not the obligation to enter into an underlying swap by a specific date at a specific strike price.
Despite the measures taken by us to
attempt to control price risk, we remain subject to price fluctuations for natural gas and crude oil sold in the spot market. Prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other
factors beyond our control. Domestic crude oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis. We routinely exercise our
contractual right to net realized gains against realized losses when settling with our financial counterparties. Neither our counterparties nor we require any collateral upon entering derivative contracts. We would have been at risk of losing a fair
value amount of $24 million had our counterparties as a group been unable to fulfill their obligations as of December31, 2012.

Interest Rate Swap 
We have variable-rate debt obligations that expose us to the
effects of changes in interest rates. To partially reduce our exposure to interest rate risk, from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements. Our last interest rate swap contract ended April 2010. At December31, 2012 and 2011,
we did not have any interest rate swaps in place. 
NOTE 9Commitments and Contingencies 
Hoover Tree Farm, LLC v. Goodrich
Petroleum Company, LLC et al. On April29, 2010 a state court in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, granted a judgment holding us solely responsible for the payment of $85 million in additional oil and natural gas lease bonus payments and related
interest in an ongoing lawsuit involving the interpretation of a unique oil and natural gas lease provision. We satisfied the requirements for posting a suspensive appeal bond by depositing $85 million in July 2010 with Iberia Bank in Shreveport,
Louisiana for the account of the Clerk of Caddo Parish Court.  On July9, 2010, the sub-lessee agreed to reimburse us for one half of any sums for which we may be cast in judgment in this lawsuit in any final non-appealable judgment, and further agreed to
reimburse us for one half of the cash bond. We reduced our accrual by $42 million in the third quarter of 2010 and the remaining $43 million as of December31, 2010 is reflected as Operating ExpensesOther in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations.  On March23, 2011,
the State of Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion which affirmed the trial courts judgment against us andamended the judgment to make both us and the sub-lessee responsible for the money judgment. On June10,
2011, we filed an application for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of Louisiana which was denied on September23, 2011. On October13, 2011, the money judgment of $44 million, including interest, was paid to the plaintiffs.
In addition, we are party to other lawsuits from
time to time arising in the normal course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty, contract, personal injury, and environmental claims. We have established reserves as appropriate for all such proceedings and intend to vigorously defend
these actions. Management believes, based on currently available information, that adverse results or judgments from such actions, if any, will not be material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity.

Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities Unaudited 
Overview 
All of our reserve information related to crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids and natural gas was compiled based on estimates
prepared and reviewed by our engineers. The technical persons primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates meet the requirements regarding qualifications. The reserves estimation is part of our internal controls
process subject to managements annual review and approval. These reserves estimates are prepared by Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. NSAI, our independent reserve engineers consulting firm, as of December31,
2012, 2011 and 2010. A copy of NSAIs summary reserve report for 2012 is furnished as exhibit 991 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of the subject reserves are located in the continental United States, primarily in Texas and Louisiana.
Many assumptions and judgmental decisions are
required to estimate reserves. Quantities reported are considered reasonable but are subject to future revisions, some of which may be substantial, as additional information becomes available. Such additional knowledge may be gained as the result of
reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes, and other factors. 
Regulations published by the SEC define proved oil and natural gas reserves as those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis
of geosciences and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulation
before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether the estimate is a deterministic estimate or probabilistic estimate. Proved developed oil
and natural gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new
well or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimates if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 
Prices we used to value our reserves are based on the
twelve-month un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the period January through December 2012. For oil volumes, the average WTI spot price of $9121 per barrel is adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, and
regional price differentials. For natural gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price of $276 per MMBtu is adjusted by lease for energy content, transportation fees, and regional price differentials.

Revisions of previous estimates in 2012 were negative reflecting significant natural gas pricing decreases which caused a number of our vertical proved undeveloped
natural gas locations, primarily in Northwest Louisiana and East Texas areas, to become uneconomic at those lower price levels.

Extensions and discoveries were positive on an overall basis in all three periods presented, primarily related to our continued drilling activity on existing and newly
acquired properties in the Northwest Louisiana, East Texas and South Texas areas. We recognized reserve adds of 324 Bcfe in 2012 related to extensions and discoveries, of which approximately 21 Bcfe is attributed to the Haynesville Shale Trend and
Cotton Valley Taylor Sand, approximately 291 Bcfe is attributed to the Eagle Ford Shale Trend and 12 Bcfe in other areas. 3
In 2012, we sold approximately 361 Bcfe attributed to the sale of properties in the South Henderson field located in East Texas. In December 2010, we sold
approximately 33 Bcfe attributed to our shallow rights in several fields in East Texas and Northwest Louisiana retaining ownership of all the deep rights including the Haynesville Shale Trend formations. 4
Reserves were recast for 2011 to break out NGLs from our natural gas in our Eagle Ford Shale Trend, West Brachfield, South Henderson, Minden and Beckville fields. Our
production and sales volumes are accounted for and disclosed based on the wet gas stream at the point of sale. 5
We report no NGL production, as NGLs are processed after the point of sale. However, we share and receive the pricing benefit of the revenue stream of the gas through
the processing. We believe that presenting NGLs separately from natural gas and oil in our reserve report provides more information for our investors. The presentation of NGLs as a separate commodity more accurately presents to investors our
economic interest in those NGLs separated, produced and sold from the wet gas streams which we realize through our sharing in the revenue stream attributable to the processed NGLs. These commodities have separate pricing that is monitored in the
marketplace.  Standardized

These index prices, used to estimate our reserves at these dates, are before deducting or adding applicable transportation and quality differentials on a well-by-well
basis.  We believe with reasonable
certainty that we will be able to obtain such capital in the normal course of business. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted using a rate of 10 percent per year to reflect the estimated timing of the future cash flows. The
standardized measure of discounted cash flows is the future net cash flows less the computed discount.
