The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Cyberian Outpost, Inc  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Cyberian Outpost, Inc. as
of February 28, 1998 and 1999, and the related statements of operations,
redeemable preferred stock and changes in stockholders' equity deficit, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February 28,
1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Cyberian Outpost, Inc. as
of February 28, 1998 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February 28, 1999,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Years ended February 28, 1997, 1998 and 1999
1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a Description of Business
Cyberian Outpost, Inc. Cyberian or the Company was incorporated in the
state of Connecticut on March 6, 1995 and reincorporated in the state of
Delaware on July 8, 1998. The Company is a leading, global, online retailer of
computer hardware and software products. In December 1998, the Company
dissolved a non-operating subsidiary, Cyberian Merchant Solutions, Inc.
b Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
c Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all
investment instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents at February 28, 1999 included investments in
overnight repurchase agreements, money market funds and commercial paper.
d Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the weighted average cost method.
e Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment under capital lease
obligations is stated at the lesser of the present value of minimum rental and
other lease payments or fair value at the time of acquisition. Depreciation and
amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, or over the term of the lease if shorter.
Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes are as follows               
Computers.                     3 years
Purchased software.                    2-3 years

j Stock-based Compensation
On March 1, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which
permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting period the fair value
of all stock-based awards on the date of grant. For employee stock-based
awards, SFAS No. 123 allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net
earnings disclosures for employee stock option grants made in fiscal 1996 and
later years as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been
applied. The Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosure of SFAS No. 123.
The Company accounts for non-employee stock-based awards in which goods or
services are the consideration received for the equity instruments issued based
on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity
instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
k Net Loss Per Common Share
Net loss per share is presented under the provisions of SFAS No. 128,
Earnings per Share. In accordance with the pronouncement, the net loss
applicable to common stockholders includes the accretion of and dividends on
the Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock through the date of
conversion to Common Stock. Weighted average shares outstanding includes the
Common Stock resulting from the conversion of the Series A and Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock and Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
Convertible Stock from the date of conversion through the end of the year.
Basic loss per share was computed by dividing net loss applicable to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of outstanding for each
period presented. Diluted loss per share has not been presented separately, as
the outstanding stock options, warrants and contingent stock purchase warrants
are anti-dilutive for each of the periods presented.
26               CYBERIAN OUTPOST, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Pro forma net loss per share has been computed under SFAS No. 128, except
that it reflects the conversion of the Convertible Stock as of the beginning of
the earliest period presented or date of issuance, whichever is later.
Therefore, the pro forma net loss per share does not include the accretion of
or dividends on the Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. The pro
forma weighted average shares outstanding includes the Common Stock resulting
from the conversion of the Convertible Stock as of the beginning of the
earliest period presented or the date of issuance, whichever is later.
Anti-dilutive potential common shares outstanding were 180,000, 9,807,206
and 5,243,790 as of February 28, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
Net loss for the year ended February 28, 1999 has been increased by $823,092
to arrive at net loss applicable to common stockholders, to give effect to
$612,838 of dividends and $210,254 of accretion on the Redeemable Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued o Comprehensive Income
On March 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and presentation of
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements.
Comprehensive income consists of net loss and net unrealized gains losses on

p Investment Securities
Investment securities at February 28 ,1999 consist of short-term corporate
and government-backed debt instruments with a minimum rating of AA. The Company

Unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax effect, on holdings of
available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a
separate component of other comprehensive income loss until realized.
Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are
determined on a specific identification basis.
A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below cost
that is deemed to be other than temporary, results in a reduction in the
carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new
cost basis for the security is established. Dividend and interest income are
recognized when earned.

d Flooring Line
The Company has a $70 million flooring credit agreement with Deutsche
Financial Services Corporation DFS pursuant to which DFS may, at its
option, extend credit to the Company from time to time to purchase inventory
from DFS approved vendors or for other purposes. Under this agreement, the
Company can purchase inventory from certain vendors and elect to have these
vendors invoice DFS. DFS pays the invoice and, in turn, bills the Company on a
periodic basis throughout the month. If the note is paid within 30 days, the
Company pays no interest. If the note remains outstanding after 30 days, the
Company pays a 25% fee and interest accrues at a variable rate based on the
prime rate plus 25%. If the note remains outstanding after 181 days, interest
begins to accrue at the prime rate plus 65%. To date, the Company has paid all
notes within 30 days and has incurred no interest expense under this facility.
All of the Company assets and the pledge of $25 million in cash instruments
secure this facility. As of February 28, 1999, there was an outstanding balance
of $52 million under this facility, which is included in accounts payable in
the accompanying balance sheet.

1999 was $3,593,300 and $14,177,300, respectively. The net change in the total
valuation allowance for the years ended February 28, 1997, 1998 and 1999 was an
increase of $609,600, $2,877,500 and $10,584,000, respectively. In assessing
the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment. Taxable loss for the years ended

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
1997, 1998 and 1999 was $1,078,709, $6,051,095 and $25,416,400, respectively.
Based upon the historical taxable losses of the company, the limitations
imposed on the future utilization of such losses, and the uncertainty of
generating sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character over the
periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it
is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of these
deductible differences at February 28, 1999.
Subsequent recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets as of February 28, 1999 will be allocated as follows

$13,804,000
Additional paid-in    373,300
$14,177,300
At February 28, 1999, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for
federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $32,750,000 which are
available to offset future federal taxable income, if any, through 2019 and
2004, respectively. However, during the year ended February 28, 1998, the
Company experienced an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code, due to additional sales of Preferred Stock. The Company
has not yet assessed the Section 382 implications of the additional stock
issuances, but the change in control may limit the utilization of the net
operating loss carryforwards incurred prior to the ownership change.
10 International Sales and Geographic Information
During fiscal 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Prior-period amounts have
been restated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 131. There were no
sales to any individual customer during any of the years in the three-year
period ended February 28, 1999 that represented 10% or more of net sales. The
Company has no material long-lived assets located in foreign countries. The
Company attributes net sales to an individual country based upon the location
of the customer.
The Company operates in one principal business segment across domestic and
international markets. International sales all emanate from the United States,
and represented approximately 47%, 36% and 14% of net sales for the years ended
February, 28 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
