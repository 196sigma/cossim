SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESNature of Our BusinessWe are a leading food and beverage company and the largest processor and direct-to-store distributor of milk and other dairy and dairy case products in the United States. We have aligned our leadership teams, operating strategies and supply chain initiatives under a single operating and reportable segment. We process and distribute fluid milk and other dairy products, including ice cream, ice cream mix and cultured products, which are marketed under more than 50local and regional dairy brands and a wide array of private labels. We also produce and distribute TruMoo, which is our nationally branded, reformulated flavored milk, as well as juices, teas, bottled water and other products.Basis of Presentation and ConsolidationOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.On August26, 2013, we effected a 1-for-2reverse stock split of our issued common stock. Each stockholders percentage ownership and proportional voting power generally remained unchanged as a result of the reverse stock split. All applicable share data, per share amounts and related information in the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively to give effect to the 1-for-2reverse stock split. See Note 13.Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, we combined the results of our business operations and the corporate items previously categorized as Corporate and Other into a single reportable segment, as all of our corporate activities now directly support our ongoing dairy operations. This change reflects the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, determines strategy and investment plans for our business given the changes to our operating structure as a result of the WhiteWave spin-off and the Morningstar sale in 2013. See Note 2and 3. All operating results herein have been recast to present results on a comparable basis. These changes had no impact on consolidated net sales and operating income.Unless otherwise indicated, references in this report to we, us or our refer to Dean Foods Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to use our judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Cash EquivalentsWe consider temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash  are stated at the lower of cost or market. Our products are valued using the first-in, first-out method. The costs of finished goods inventories include raw materials, direct labor and indirect production and overhead costs. Reserves for obsolete or excess inventory are not material.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost, plus capitalized interest on borrowings during the actual construction period of major capital projects. Also included in property, plant and equipment are certain direct costs related to the implementation of computer software for internal use. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method typically over the following range of estimated useful lives of the  and equipment3 to 20 yearsLeasehold improvementsOver the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the applicable lease agreementsWe test property, plant and equipment for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment could include significant changes in business environment or the planned closure of a facility. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows. See Note 17. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance which do not improve or extend the life of the assets are expensed as incurred.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsIdentifiable intangible assets, other than indefinite-lived trademarks, are typically amortized over the following range of estimated useful lives:F-6Table of ContentsAssetUseful LifeCustomer  finite-lived trademarks5 to 15 yearsCustomer supply contractsOverthe shorter of the estimated useful lives or theterms of the agreementsNoncompetition agreementsOverthe shorter of the estimated useful lives or theterms ofthe agreementsDeferred financing  accordance with Accounting Standards related to Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives. Instead, we assess our goodwill and indefinite-lived trademarks for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. See Note 7.Assets Held for SaleWe classify assets as held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan of sale and our expectation is that the sale will be completed within one year. The net assets of the business held for sale are then recorded at the lower of their current carrying value or the fair market value, less costs to sell. As of December31, 2014and 2013, $40 millionand $45 million, respectively, related to closed production facilities was classified as held for sale and recorded in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Foreign Currency TranslationThe financial statements of our foreign subsidiary, which are not material, are translated from Mexican pesos, which is the functional currency of that subsidiary, to U.S. dollars. The assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at the average rates prevailing during the year. Changes in exchange rates that affect cash flows and the related receivables or payables are recognized as transaction gains and losses and are recognized in the statement of operations with their related operational activity. Currently, an immaterial amount of transaction gains and losses are reflected in general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cumulative translation adjustment in our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity reflects the unrealized adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiary.Share-Based CompensationShare-based compensation expense is recognized for equity awards over the vesting period based on their grant date fair value. The fair value of option awards is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our phantom shares is remeasured at each reporting period based on the closing price of our common stock on the last day of the respective reporting period. Compensation expense is recognized only for equity awards expected to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations. Share-based compensation expense is included within the same financial statement caption where the recipients cash compensation is reported. See Note 12.Revenue Recognition, Sales Incentives and Accounts ReceivableSales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the product has been delivered to the customer and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. Sales are recorded net of allowances for returns, trade promotions and prompt pay and other discounts. We routinely offer sales incentives and discounts through various regional and national programs to our customers and consumers. These programs include rebates, shelf-price reductions, in-store display incentives, coupons and other trade promotional activities. These programs, as well as amounts paid to customers for shelf-space in retail stores, are considered reductions in the price of our products and thus are recorded as reductions to gross sales. Some of these incentives are recorded by estimating incentive costs based on our historical experience and expected levels of performance of the trade promotion. We maintain liabilities at the end of each period for the estimated incentive costs incurred but unpaid for these programs. Differences between estimated and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.Bulk cream represents a by-product of our fluid milk manufacturing process. We either use bulk cream in our manufacturing process or we dispose of it through third party sales to other companies.  We present bulk cream by-product sales as a reduction of cost of sales within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We believe this presentation is reasonable as it allows us to report our true cost of fluid milk production.F-7Table of ContentsWe provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30days, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on our historical experience. Estimated product returns have not historically been material.Income TaxesAll of our consolidated U.S. operating subsidiaries are included in our U.S. federal consolidated income tax return. Our foreign subsidiary is required to file local jurisdiction income tax return with respect to their operations, the earnings from which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely. At December31, 2014, noprovision had been made for U.S. federal or state income tax on approximately $142 millionof accumulated foreign earnings as they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and other basis differences is not practicable.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets, including the benefit of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, are evaluated based on the guidelines for realization and are reduced by a valuation allowance if deemed necessary.We recognize the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes. We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense, and penalties, if incurred, are recognized as a component of operating income.Advertising ExpenseWe market our products through advertising and other promotional activities, including media, agency, coupons, trade shows and other promotional activities. Advertising expense is charged to income during the period incurred, except for expenses related to the development of a major commercial or media campaign which are charged to income during the period in which the advertisement or campaign is first presented by the media. Advertising expense totaled $275 millionin 2014, $220 millionin 2013and $286 millionin 2012. Prepaid advertising expense totaled $07 millionin 2014, $23 millionin 2013and $06 millionin 2012.Shipping and Handling FeesOur shipping and handling costs are included in both cost of sales and selling and distribution expense, depending on the nature of such costs. Shipping and handling costs included in cost of sales reflect inventory warehouse costs and product loading and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs included in selling and distribution expense consist primarily of those costs associated with moving finished products from production facilities through our distribution network, including costs associated with its distribution centers, route delivery costs and the cost of shipping products to customers through third party carriers. Shipping and handling costs that were recorded as a component of selling and distribution expense were $12 billionin each of 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively.Insurance AccrualsWe retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self-insured with stop-loss coverage. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of factors including claims history and expected trends.Research and DevelopmentOur research and development activities primarily consist of generating and testing new product concepts, new flavors and packaging. Our total research and development expense was $19 million, $18 millionand $21 millionfor 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively. Research and development costs are primarily included in general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. We are required to adopt the standard prospectively for new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups as held for sale beginning the first quarter of 2015. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Revenue Recognition Topic 605, and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.F-8Table of ContentsIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No2014-12, Compensation Stock Compensation Topic 718: Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. ASU No. 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements.In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements2. WHITEWAVE SPIN-OFF TRANSACTION AND DISPOSITION OF REMAINING OWNERSHIP OF WHITEWAVE COMMON STOCKOn October31, 2012, WhiteWave completed the WhiteWave IPO, and sold 23 millionshares of its ClassA common stock at a price to the public of $17per share. The WhiteWave IPO was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC 810 and no gain or loss was recognized as we retained the controlling financial interest immediately upon completion of the transaction. The WhiteWave IPO increased our equity attributable to non-controlling interest by $981 million, which represented the carrying value of the non-controlling interest, increased our additional paid-in capital by $265 millionand reduced our accumulated other comprehensive loss by $45 million. Upon completion of the WhiteWave IPO, we owned an 867%economic interest, and a 985%voting interest, in WhiteWave.On May23, 2013, we completed the spin-off of WhiteWave through a tax-free distribution to our stockholders of an aggregate of 47,686,000shares of WhiteWave ClassA common stock and 67,914,000shares of WhiteWave Class B common stock as a pro rata dividend on the shares of Dean Foods common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date of May17, 2013. Each share of Dean Foods common stock received 025544448shares of WhiteWave ClassA common stock and 036380189shares of WhiteWave Class B common stock in the distribution. The WhiteWave spin-off qualified as a tax-free distribution to Dean Foods stockholders for U.S. federal tax purposes; however, cash received in lieu of fractional shares was taxable.In connection with the WhiteWave spin-off, we recorded a $6171 millionreduction to additional paid-in capital. The distribution was recorded through additional paid-in capital rather than through retained earnings, as we were in an accumulated deficit position at the time of the WhiteWave spin-off. Upon completion of the WhiteWave spin-off, we reclassified WhiteWaves results of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3. We retained ownership of 34,400,000shares of WhiteWaves ClassA common stock, or approximately 199%of the economic interest of WhiteWave, which we disposed of in July 2013 in a tax-free transaction described in more detail below. From the completion of the WhiteWave spin-off through the date of disposition in July 2013, we accounted for our investment in WhiteWave common stock using the fair value method of accounting for available-for-sale securities, which requires the investment to be marked to market with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized or until losses are deemed to be other-than-temporary.On July25, 2013, we announced the closing of a secondary public offering of 344 millionshares of ClassA common stock of WhiteWave owned by us at a public offering price of $1775per share. Following the closing of the offering, we no longer owned any shares of WhiteWave common stock. Immediately prior to the closing of the offering, we exchanged our shares of WhiteWave ClassA common stock in partial satisfaction of two term loans. Following the closing of the debt-for-equity exchange, we repaid the non-exchanged balance of the two term loans in full and terminated the loan agreement. The debt-for-equity exchange resulted in total cash proceeds, net of underwriting fees, of $5892 million. We recorded a gain in continuing operations of $4158 million, which included $3856 millionof unrealized holding gains that were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income as of June30, 2013, in the third quarter of 2013 related to the disposition of our investment in WhiteWave common stock. The gain represents the excess of the value of the exchanged shares of WhiteWave ClassA common stock over our cost basis in such shares. The gain was recorded in the gain on disposition of WhiteWave common stock line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As the debt-for-equity exchange qualified as a tax-free transaction pursuant to the terms of our private letter ruling from the IRS, we did not incur, nor did we record, any income tax expense associated with the transaction.F-9Table of Contents3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND DIVESTITURESWhiteWave and MorningstarWhiteWave Spin-Off As discussed in Note 2, on May23, 2013, we completed the WhiteWave spin-off through a tax-free distribution to our stockholders. Following the WhiteWave spin-off, we retained 344 millionshares of WhiteWaves ClassA common stock, or approximately 199%of WhiteWaves economic interest. While we are a party to certain commercial agreements with WhiteWave, we have determined that the continuing cash flows generated by these agreements which are not expected to extend beyond June 2015 and the retention and subsequent monetization of our investment in WhiteWave common stock in July 2013 as discussed in Note 2and below, did not constitute significant continuing involvement in the operations of WhiteWave. Accordingly, the net assets, operating results and cash flows of WhiteWave have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. From January1, 2013 through May23, 2013 the date of the WhiteWave spin-off, our net sales to WhiteWave totaled $103 millionand our purchases from WhiteWave totaled $332 million. These transactions, which were previously eliminated in consolidation prior to the spin-off, are now reflected as third-party transactions in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December31, 2014and December31, 2013, accounts receivable from, and accounts payable to, WhiteWave are presented as third-party balances in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Morningstar Divestiture The sale of Morningstar closed on January3, 2013 and we received net proceeds of approximately $145 billion. We recorded a gain of $8688 million$4919 million, net of tax on the sale of Morningstar during the year ended December31, 2013, which excludes $229 millionof transaction costs recognized in discontinued operations during the year ended December31, 2012. Accordingly, the net assets, operating results and cash flows of Morningstar have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented herein.The following is a summary of operating results and certain other directly attributable expenses, including interest expense, which are included in discontinued operations for the years ended December31, 2013and 2012:Year Ended  thousandsOperations:Net  loss before income  tax expense  income  income tax expense attributable to WhiteWave during the year ended December31, 2013 includes approximately $311 millionrelated to certain deferred intercompany transactions which were recognized upon the completion of the WhiteWave spin-off. Because these liabilities arose as a direct result of the spin-off of WhiteWave, we have reflected the income statement impact of such liabilities as a component of discontinued operations.The following is a summary of directly attributable transaction expenses which are included in discontinued operations for the years ended December31, 2013and 2012:Year Ended December31,in  the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012we incurred an immaterial amount of expense related to other transactional activities, which is recorded in general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.F-10Table of ContentsDuring the year ended December31, 2014, we recognized net losses from discontinued operations of $07 millionfrom the finalization of certain pre-separation tax items related to WhiteWave. During the year ended December31, 2014, we recognized net gains on the sale of discontinued operations, net of tax, of $05 million, from favorable taxing authority settlements related to Morningstar and other prior discontinued operations. Other Activity in Discontinued OperationsIn July 2012, pursuant to a settlement reached with respect to certain contingent obligations that we retained in connection with the 2006 sale of our Iberian operations, we paid a total of 57 million$72 million, which was inclusive of accrued interest and related fees and expenses, and incurred charges of $25 million, net of tax, which were in addition to amounts we had previously accrued in connection with these contingent obligations. The additional charges recorded during 2012 were included in gain loss on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax in our Consolidated Statements of Operations4. INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATESSale of Unconsolidated Affiliate and Related PartyConsolidated Container CompanyOn July3, 2012, our approximate 25%non-controlling interest, on a fully diluted basis, in Consolidated Container Company CCC, one of the nations largest manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and our largest supplier of plastic bottles and bottle components, was sold in connection with Vestar Capital Partners sale of the business operations of CCC. Vestar Capital Partners, an unaffiliated entity, controlled CCC through a majority ownership interest. Prior to the sale, our investment in CCC was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and had been recorded at zerovalue since 2001 when we determined the investment to be permanently impaired. As a result of the sale, we received cash proceeds of $580 million. As the tax basis of our investment in CCC is calculated differently than the carrying value of our investment, we incurred a cash tax obligation of approximately $90 million, which was paid during fourth quarter of 2012. During 2012, we recorded a pre-tax gain from the sale of $580 millionwhich was recorded in other operating income loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and additional income tax expense of $684 million, resulting in a net after-tax loss on the sale of the investment of $104 million. We spent $2041 millionon products purchased from CCC during 2012 prior to the sale of our interest on July3, 20125.

See Note 17for information regarding plant, property and equipment write-downs incurred in conjunction with our restructuring plans and certain other events7. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSOur goodwill and intangible assets have resulted from acquisitions. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including trademarks and customer-related intangible assets, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized.A trademark is determined to have an indefinite life if it has a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual trademark criteria are not met, the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives. Determining the expected life of a trademark is based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, trademark history and anticipated future trademark support.Amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating environment or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows.We conduct impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment. We evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level. During the year ended December31, 2013, we disposed of Morningstar, WhiteWave and Alpro reporting units and, upon completion of the WhiteWave spin-off, our remaining goodwill was entirely attributable to our ongoing dairy operations.In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we are permitted under the accounting guidance to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a resorting unit is less than its carrying value, then we perform a two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized, if any. Under the accounting guidance, we also have an option at any time, to bypass the qualitative assessment process and perform the two-step impairment test. We elected to do so for our annual impairment test and, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed a step one goodwill impairment analysis. F-12Table of ContentsFor purposes of the step one analysis, we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit using both the income approach that analyzed projected discounted cash flows and a market approach that considered other comparable companies. Both approaches resulted in fair value estimates greater than our carrying value. Assumptions used in our valuations were consistent with our internal projections and operating plans, as well as other factors and assumptions and utilized unobservable inputs Level 3, as defined in Note 11 and significant management judgment. Additionally, under the market approach analysis, we used significant other observable inputs Level 2, as defined in Note 11 including various peer company comparisons. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the conclusions of the step one analysis for our reporting unit.Based on the results of the step one analysis, we determined that the carrying value of our reporting unit is greater than zeroand its fair value exceeds the carrying value. Accordingly, we were not required to perform step two of the impairment analysis. Nogoodwill impairment charges were recognized in 2014, 2013and 2012. As of December 31, 2014, the gross carrying value of goodwill was $22 billionand accumulated impairment was $21 billion. The company took an impairment charge of $21 billionin 2011 with no impairment charges in subsequent years. The net carrying amount of goodwill at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $868 million.Based on the results of our evaluation of impairment of our intangible assets with indefinite lives, there was noimpairment charge during 2014. During 2013, as a result of declining volumes and projected future cash flows related to one of our indefinite-lived trademarks, we recorded an impairment charge of $44 millionto reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value. This charge was recorded in the impairment of long-lived assets line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We can provide no assurance that we will not have impairment charges in future periods as a result of changes in our operating results or the assumptions utilized in our impairment tests.The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of our intangible assets other than goodwill as of December31, 2014and 2013are as  thousandsIntangible assets with indefinite  assets with finite lives:Customer-related and  described above, during 2013we recorded an impairment charge of $44 millionto reduce the carrying value of one of our indefinite-lived trademarks to its estimated fair value2During the first quarter of 2013, we wrote off a favorable lease asset with a net book value of $35 millionin connection with our abandonment of the facility to which the favorable lease related.

The remaining $80 millionrepresents tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Due to the impact of deferred income tax accounting, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect our effective tax rate but would accelerate payment of cash to the applicable taxing authority. We do not expect any material changes to our liability for uncertain tax positions during the next 12 months.We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recorded in general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest expense recorded in income tax expense for 2014, 2013and 2012was immaterial. Our liability for uncertain tax positions included accrued interest of $13 millionand $20 millionat December31, 2014and 2013, respectively.During 2014, the Internal Revenue Service IRS officially closed their examination of our 2007 through 2011 U.S. consolidated income tax returns after receiving approval by the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Our 2012through 2014U.S. consolidated income tax returns remain open for examination by the IRS.

The credit agreement was amended in June 2014 and further amended in August 2014. Under the agreement, as amended, we have the right to request an increase of the aggregate commitment under the credit facility, and to request incremental term loans or increased revolver commitments of, up to $500 millionwithout the consent of any lenders not participating in such increase, subject to specified conditions. The proceeds of the credit facility are usedto finance our working capital needs and for general corporate purposes of us and our subsidiaries. The senior secured credit facility is available for the issuance of up to $200 millionof letters of credit and up to $150 millionof swing line loans. The facility will terminate on July2, 2018.In connection with the amendment entered into in August 2014, the Company paid certain consent and arrangement fees of approximately $10 millionto lenders and other fees, which were capitalized and will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the facility. During the third quarter of 2013, we incurred approximately $6 millionof fees in connection with the execution of the new senior secured credit facility, which were capitalized and will be amortized to interest expense over the five-year term of the facility. Loans outstanding under the senior secured credit facility bear interest, at our election, at either the Adjusted LIBO Rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a margin of between 125%and 275%275%as of December31, 2014 based on the leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement, or the Alternate Base Rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a margin of between 025%and 175%175%as of December31, 2014 based on the leverage ratio. We are permitted to make optional prepayments of the loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty other than applicable LIBOR breakage costs. Subject to certain exceptions and conditions described in the credit agreement, we are obligated to prepay the credit facility, but without a corresponding commitment reduction, with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and with casualty and insurance proceeds.F-17Table of ContentsThe senior secured credit facility is guaranteed by our existing and future domestic material restricted subsidiaries as defined in the credit agreement, which are substantially all of our wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries other than our receivables securitization subsidiaries. The facility is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the personal property of us and our guarantors, whether consisting of tangible or intangible property, including a pledge of, and a perfected security interest in, iall of the shares of capital stock of the guarantors and ii65%of our or any guarantors first-tier foreign subsidiaries which are material restricted subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the credit agreement. The collateral does not include any real property, the capital stock and any assets of any unrestricted subsidiary, or any capital stock of any direct or indirect subsidiary of our wholly-owned subsidiary Dean Holding Company Legacy Dean which owns any real property.Under the senior secured credit facility, as amended, we are required to comply with aa maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of 525x for each fiscal quarter ending on or prior to December 31, 2014; 500x for each fiscal quarter ending on or prior to March 31, 2015; 450x for each fiscal quarter ending on or prior to June 30, 2015; and 400x for each fiscal quarter ending thereafter; b a senior secured net leverage ratio not to exceed 250x; and ca minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 300x, in each case, as defined under and calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and our receivables-backed facility.The credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including but not limited to specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens, guarantee obligations, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, leases, payment of dividends and other restricted payments, investments, loans and advances, transactions with affiliates and sale and leaseback transactions, as well as the financial covenants described below. The credit agreement also contains customary events of default and related cure provisions. There are no restrictions on the payment of dividends when our leverage ratio is below 325x on a pro forma basis. The credit agreement also contains customary events of default and related cure provisions. At December31, 2014, there were outstanding borrowings of $703 millionunder the senior secured revolving credit facility. Our average daily balance under the senior secured revolving credit facility during the year ended December31, 2014was $521 million. There were noletters of credit issued under the senior secured revolving credit facility as of December31, 2014.Prior Amended Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility Terminated Effective July2, 2013 In July 2013, we terminated our prior credit facility, as amended, and executed a new senior secured credit facility. Our prior credit facility consisted of an original combination of a $15 billionfive-year revolving credit facility, a $15 billionfive-year term loanA and a $18 billionseven-year term loanB. In October 2012, we used the combined proceeds we received from the WhiteWave IPO and WhiteWaves initial borrowings under its senior secured credit facilities described in Note 10to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K to repay in full the then-outstanding $480 millionaggregate principal amount of our 2014 Tranche A term loan and the then-outstanding $675 millionaggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2014 Tranche B term loan. Additionally, as discussed in Note 3, on January3, 2013, we completed the sale of Morningstar and received net proceeds of approximately $145 billion, a portion of which was used for the full repayment of $480 millionin outstanding 2016 Tranche B term loan borrowings, $547 millionin outstanding 2017 Tranche B term loan borrowings and $265 millionin revolver borrowings outstanding as of December31, 2012. As a result of these principal repayments, we wrote off $15 millionin previously deferred financing costs related to the prior credit facility during the first quarter of 2013.The prior credit facility was available for the issuance of up to $350 millionof letters of credit and up to $150 millionof swing line loans. The prior credit facility was secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets, including the assets of our domestic subsidiaries, but excluding the capital stock of subsidiaries of Legacy Dean, the real property owned by Legacy Dean and its subsidiaries, and accounts receivable associated with the receivables-backed facility. The credit agreement governing our prior credit facility contained standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the credit agreement, default on certain of our other debt, a change in control and certain other material adverse changes in our business. The prior credit agreement did not contain any requirements to maintain specific credit rating levels.During the third quarter of 2013, as a result of the termination of our prior credit agreement and the extinguishment of the related debt, we wrote off $54 millionin previously deferred financing costs associated with the prior credit facility.Short Term Credit Facility and Debt-for-Equity Exchange Agreement As discussed in Note 2, on July11, 2013, in connection with the anticipated monetization of our remaining shares of WhiteWaves ClassA common stock, we entered into a loan agreement with certain lenders, pursuant to which we were provided with two term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $6268 million, consisting of a $545 millionterm loan required to be repaid no later than August12, 2013, and an $818 millionF-18Table of Contentsterm loan required to be repaid no later than September 9, 2013. We used the proceeds from the credit facility for general corporate purposes. Loans outstanding under the short-term credit facility bore interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate as defined in the loan agreement plus a margin of 250%. We were permitted to make optional prepayments of the loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty other than any applicable LIBOR breakage costs.The credit facility was unsecured and was guaranteed by our existing and future domestic material restricted subsidiaries as defined in the loan agreement, which are substantially all of our wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries other than our receivables securitization subsidiaries. The loan agreement contained certain representations, warranties and covenants, including, but not limited to specified restrictions on acquisitions and payment of dividends, as well as maintenance of certain liquidity levels. The loan agreement also contained customary events of default and related cure provisions. We were required to comply with a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio initially set at 400x and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio set at 300x.As disclosed in Note 2, on July25, 2013, we announced the closing of a secondary public offering of 344 millionshares of ClassA common stock of WhiteWave owned by us at a public offering price of $1775per share. Immediately prior to the closing of the offering, we exchanged our shares of WhiteWave ClassA common stock for $5892 millionof the two term loans, which loans were held by two of the underwriters in the offering. Following the closing of the debt-for-equity exchange, we repaid the non-exchanged balance of the two term loans in full and terminated the loan agreement.Dean Foods Receivables-Backed Facility We have a $550 millionreceivables securitization facility pursuant to which certain of our subsidiaries sell their accounts receivable to two wholly-owned entities intended to be bankruptcy-remote. The entities then transfer the receivables to third-party asset-backed commercial paper conduits sponsored by major financial institutions. The assets and liabilities of these two entities are fully reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the securitization is treated as a borrowing for accounting purposes. In June 2014, the receivables-backed facility was modified to, among other things, increase the amount available for the issuance of letters of credit from $300 millionto $350 millionand to extend the liquidity termination date from March 2015 to June 2017. The receivables-backed facility was further amended in August 2014 to be consistent with the amended financial covenants under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.Based on the monthly borrowing base formula, we had the ability to borrow up to $550 millionof the total commitment amount under the receivables-backed facility as of December31, 2014. The total amount of receivables sold to these entities as of December31, 2014was $6855 million. During the year ended December31, 2014we borrowed $27 billionand subsequently repaid $26 billionunder the facility with a remaining drawn balance of $2350 millionas of December31, 2014. Excluding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $1638 million, the remaining available borrowing capacity was $1512 millionat December31, 2014. Our average daily balance under this facility during the year ended December31, 2014was $2496 million. The receivables-backed facility bears interest at a variable rate based upon commercial paper and one-month LIBOR rates plus an applicable margin.On July2, 2013, we amended our receivables purchase agreement to implement certain modifications in connection with the senior secured credit facility described above. On October7, 2013, we further amended our receivables purchase agreement to, among other things, conform the financial covenants and related definitions to those in our senior secured credit facility.Standby Letter of Credit In February2012, in connection with a litigation settlement agreement we entered into with the plaintiffs in the Tennessee dairy farmer actions, we issued a standby letter of credit in the amount of $80 million, representing the approximate subsequent payments due under the terms of the settlement agreement. The total amount of the letter of credit will decrease proportionately as we make each of the four installment payments. We made installment payments in June of 2014 and 2013. As of December31, 2014, the letter of credit had been reduced to $377 million.We are currently in compliance with all covenants under our credit agreements.Dean Foods Company Senior Notes due 2018 On December16, 2010, we issued $400 millionaggregate principal amount of 975%senior unsecured notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers and in offshore transactions, and on August3, 2011, we exchanged $400 millionof the senior notes for new notes that are registered under the Securities Act and do not have restrictions on transfer, rights to special interest or registration rights.These notes are our senior unsecured obligations and mature on December15, 2018with interest payable on June15 and December15 of each year.The indenture under which we issued the senior notes due 2018 does not contain financial covenants but does contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness, enter into sale-leaseback transactions and engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired $3762 millionprincipal amount of these notes pursuant to a cash redemption offer, described more fully below. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we retired the remaining $238 millionof principal amount of the senior notes due 2018 pursuant to the cash redemption offer described more fully below. The carrying value of the remaining notes outstanding at December31, 2014was zero.F-19Table of ContentsDean Foods Company Senior Notes due 2016 In 2006, we issued $500 millionaggregate principal amount of 700%senior unsecured notes. The senior unsecured notes mature in June 2016, and interest is payable on June1 and December1 of each year. The indenture under which we issued the senior notes due 2016 does not contain financial covenants but does contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness, enter into sale-leaseback transactions and engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired $238 millionof principal amount of the senior notes due 2016 pursuant to a cash tender offer, described more fully below. The carrying value of the remaining notes outstanding at December31, 2014was $4758 million.Redemption of Dean Foods Company Senior Notes due 2018 In December 2014, we completed the redemption of our remaining outstanding Senior Notes due 2018. We redeemed the entire $24 millionoutstanding principal amount of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 104875%of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or approximately $261 millionin total. As a result of the redemption, we recorded a $14 millionpre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of debt redemption premiums of $12 millionand a write-off of unamortized debt issue costs of $02 million. The loss was recorded in the loss on early retirement of debt line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The redemption was financed with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility.                       Cash Tender Offer on Dean Foods Company Senior Notes due 2018 and 2016 On November12, 2013, we announced that we had commenced a cash tender offer for up to $400 millioncombined aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due 2018 and Senior Notes due 2016, with priority given to the Senior Notes due 2018, and a consent solicitation to amend the indenture related to our Senior Notes due 2018. The transaction closed during the fourth quarter of 2013, and we purchased $3762 millionaggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2018, which included a premium of approximately $54 million, and $238 millionaggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes due 2016, which included a premium of approximately $3 million. The tender offer was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. As a result of the tender offer, we recorded a $633 millionpre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt $387 million, net of tax in the fourth quarter of 2013, which consisted of debt tender premiums of $572 million, a write-off of unamortized debt issue costs of $55 million, and other direct costs associated with the tender offer of $06 million. The loss was recorded in the loss on early retirement of debt line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.Subsidiary Senior Notes due 2017 Legacy Dean had certain senior notes outstanding at the time of its acquisition, of which one series $142 millionaggregate principal amount remains outstanding with a maturity date of October15, 2017. The carrying value of these notes at December31, 2014was $1349 millionat 690%interest. The indenture governing the Legacy Dean senior notes does not contain financial covenants but does contain certain restrictions, including a prohibition against Legacy Dean and its subsidiaries granting liens on certain of their real property interests and a prohibition against Legacy Dean granting liens on the stock of its subsidiaries. The Legacy Dean senior notes are not guaranteed by Dean Foods Company or Legacy Deans wholly-owned subsidiaries.See Note 11for information regarding the fair value of the senior notes due 2016 and senior notes due 2018 and the subsidiary senior notes due 2017 as of December31, 2014and 2013.With regard to our overall capital structure, during the first half of 2015, subject to market conditions and the receipt of appropriate approvals, we intend to optimize our liquidity and strengthen our financial position by opportunistically refinancing, or otherwise addressing, certain of our existing long-term debt, including our 70% senior notes due June 2016. We have initiated discussions with a number of our lenders with respect to the key terms and structure of new liquidity facilities, which may include providing additional collateral to lenders under our revolving credit facility. We would look to extend maturities on both our revolving and receivables facilities and also better align our covenants structure with our long-term strategic and operational goals. The specific timing, structure, and terms of such refinancing transactions have not yet been finalized. In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be able to refinance the facilities on the expected terms or at all.Capital Lease Obligations and Other Capital lease obligations as of December31, 2014were comprised of a lease for land and building related to one of our production facilities. See Note 19.Interest Rate Agreements As of December31, 2014, there were no interest rate swap agreements in effect. See Note 11for information related to interest rate swap arrangements associated with our debt obligations that existed prior to the extinguishment of such obligations during 2013.Guarantor Information The 2016 senior notes described above are our unsecured obligations and, except as described below, are fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally guaranteed by substantially all of our 100%-owned U.S. subsidiaries other than our receivables securitization subsidiaries. The following condensed consolidating financial statements present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Dean Foods Company Parent, the 100%-owned subsidiary guarantors of the senior notes and, separately, the combined results of the 100%-owned subsidiaries that are not a party to the guarantees. F-20Table of ContentsThe 100%-owned non-guarantor subsidiaries reflect certain foreign and other operations, in addition to our receivables securitization subsidiaries.Upon completion of the WhiteWave IPO discussed in Note 2, WhiteWave and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries were released from their obligations as guarantors for the 2016 senior notes. Additionally, effective upon completion of the Morningstar sale on January3, 2013, Morningstar and its subsidiaries were no longer parties to the guarantees. Therefore, the activity and balances allocated to discontinued operations related to WhiteWave and Morningstar have been recast in the tables below for all periods presented to include Morningstar and its subsidiaries and WhiteWave and its subsidiaries in the non-guarantor column as these parties are no longer guarantors of the 2016 senior notes.Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheet as of

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSDerivative Financial InstrumentsCommoditiesWe are exposed to commodity price fluctuations, including milk, butterfat, sweeteners and other commodity costs used in the manufacturing, packaging and distribution of our products, such as natural gas, resin and diesel fuel. To secure adequate supplies of materials and bring greater stability to the cost of ingredients and their related manufacturing, packaging and distribution, we routinely enter into forward purchase contracts and other purchase arrangements with suppliers. Under the forward purchase contracts, we commit to purchasing agreed-upon quantities of ingredients and commodities at agreed-upon prices at specified future dates. The outstanding purchase commitment for these commodities at any point in time typically ranges from one months to one years anticipated requirements, depending on the ingredient or commodity. These contracts are considered normal purchases.In addition to entering into forward purchase contracts, from time to time we may purchase over-the-counter contracts from our qualified banking partners or enter into exchange-traded commodity futures contracts for raw materials that are ingredients of our products or components of such ingredients. Effective January 1, 2014, we have de-designated all open commodity derivative positions that were previously designated as cash flow hedges. During the first quarter of 2014, we reclassified $02 million, net of tax, of hedging activity related to these commodities contracts from accumulated other comprehensive income into operating income. All commodities contracts are now marked to market in our income statement at each reporting period and a derivative asset or liability is recorded on our balance sheet. Although we may utilize forward purchase contracts and other instruments to mitigate the risks related to commodity price fluctuation, such strategies do not fully mitigate commodity price risk. Adverse movements in commodity prices over the terms of the contracts or instruments could decrease the economic benefits we derive from these strategies.Interest Rates We have historically entered into interest rate swap agreements that were designated as cash flow hedges against variable interest rate exposure on a portion of our debt, with the objective of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations and stabilizing cash flows. These swap agreements provided hedges for interest on our prior senior secured credit facility by fixing the LIBOR component of interest rates specified in our prior credit facility at the interest rates specified in the interest rate swap agreements until the indicated expiration dates of these interest rate swap agreements. For the reasons described below, as of December31, 2014, we no longer had any interest rate swaps outstanding.As disclosed in Note 3, in January 2013, we completed the sale of Morningstar and used a portion of the proceeds to repay debt. As a result of these repayments, we determined that we no longer had sufficient levels of variable rate debt to support the $1 billionaggregate notional amount of interest rate hedges. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2013, we terminated these interest rate swaps, and upon termination, we paid the counterparties $280 millionbased on the fair value of the swaps on that date. As we determined that the forecasted transactions hedged by these swaps were no longer probable, we reclassified total losses of $281 million$173 millionnet of tax previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income to the interest expense line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the first quarter of 2013.In connection with the WhiteWave IPO discussed in Note 2, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we novated certain of our then-outstanding interest rate swaps with a notional value of $650 millionand a maturity date of March31, 2017the 2017 swaps to WhiteWave. WhiteWave became the sole counterparty to the financial institutions under these swap agreements, and is directly responsible for any required future settlements, and the sole beneficiary of any future receipts of funds, pursuant to the terms of the 2017 swaps.As of the novation date, these swaps were de-designated and subsequent changes in fair value were reflected in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, with a non-controlling interest adjustment for the 133%economic interest in WhiteWave that we did not own. Upon completion of the WhiteWave spin-off on May23, 2013, we determined that the underlying hedged forecasted transactions related to the 2017 novated swaps were no longer probable; therefore, during the second quarter of 2013, we reclassified total losses of $634 million$389 million, net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the 2017 swaps to earnings, as a component of interest expense. See Note 14.F-29Table of ContentsAs of December31, 2014and 2013, our derivatives recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were:Derivative AssetsDerivative LiabilitiesDecember31, 2014December31, 2013December31, 2014December31, 2013In thousandsDerivatives designated as Hedging InstrumentsCommodities contracts current1714204Derivatives not designated as Hedging InstrumentsCommodities contracts current122554,392114Total  assets and liabilities that have settlement dates equal to or less than 12 months from the respective balance sheet date were included in other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income were as follows in thousands:Year Ended December3120132012Losses on interest rate swap  on commodities  on foreign currency  in interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations2Recorded in selling and distribution or cost of sales, depending on commodity type, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations3Recorded in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering assumptions, we follow a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.Level 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.A summary of our derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2014is as follows in thousands:Fair Valueas ofDecember31, 2014Level1Level2Level3Asset Commodities contracts$2$$2$Liability Commodities contracts4,3924,392F-30Table of ContentsA summary of our derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2013is as follows in thousands:Fair Valueas ofDecember31,   contracts318318Due to their near-term maturities, the carrying amounts of accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered equivalent to fair value. In addition, because the interest rates on our senior secured credit facility, our prior credit facility, receivables-backed facility, and certain other debt are variable, their fair values approximate their carrying values.The fair values of our Dean Foods Company senior notes and subsidiary senior notes were determined based on quoted market prices obtained through an external pricing source which derives its price valuations from daily marketplace transactions, with adjustments to reflect the spreads of benchmark bonds, credit risk and certain other variables. We have determined these fair values to be Level 2 measurements as all significant inputs into the quotes provided by our pricing source are observable in active markets. The following table presents the carrying values and fair values of our senior and subsidiary senior notes at  thousandsSubsidiary senior notes due  Foods Company senior notes due  Foods Company senior notes due 201823,81226,908Additionally, we maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP, which is a nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement for our executive officers and other employees earning compensation in excess of the maximum compensation that can be taken into account with respect to our 401k plan. The SERP is designed to provide these employees with retirement benefits from us that are equivalent, as a percentage of total compensation, to the benefits provided to other employees. The assets related to this plan are primarily invested in money market and mutual funds and are held at fair value. We classify these assets as Level 2 as fair value can be corroborated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active.

COMMON STOCK AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONCash Dividends In November 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors had adopted a cash dividend policy. Under the policy, holders of our common stock will receive dividends when and as declared by our Board of Directors. Pursuant to the policy, we paid quarterly dividends of $007per share $028per share annually. Dividend payments of approximately $65 millioneach, were paid in March, June, September and December of 2014. Our cash dividend policy is subject to modification, suspension or cancellation at any time.Our authorized shares of capital stock include one millionshares of preferred stock and 500 millionshares of common stock with a par value of $001per share.F-31Table of Contents1-for-2 Reverse Stock Split On August26, 2013, we effected a 1-for-2 reverse stock split of our issued common stock. The reverse stock split ratio and the implementation and timing of the reverse stock split were determined by our Board of Directors. The reverse stock split did not change the authorized number of shares or par value of our common stock or preferred stock, but did effect a proportionate adjustment to the per share exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock awards, and the number of shares of common stock eligible for issuance under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Each stockholders percentage ownership and proportional voting power generally remained unchanged as a result of the reverse stock split.All applicable outstanding equity awards discussed below have been adjusted retroactively for the 1-for-2 reverse stock split.Conversion of Equity Awards Outstanding at Spin-Off Date At the date of the WhiteWave spin-off, certain of our outstanding Dean Foods stock options and unvested restricted stock units RSUs held by WhiteWave employees were converted to equivalent options or restricted stock units, as applicable, with respect to WhiteWaves common stock. These modified awards otherwise retained substantially the same terms and conditions, including term and vesting provisions, as the existing Dean Foods equity awards had at the time of conversion. We will not incur any future compensation cost related to conversion of our outstanding Dean Foods stock options and restricted stock units held by WhiteWave employees and directors in connection with the WhiteWave spin-off.Additionally, in connection with the WhiteWave spin-off, we proportionately adjusted the number and exercise prices of certain options, RSUs and phantom shares granted to Dean Foods employees and directors that were outstanding at the time of the WhiteWave spin-off to maintain the aggregate intrinsic value of such awards at the date of the WhiteWave spin-off, pursuant to the terms of these awards. The conversion ratio was determined based on the 5-day volume weighted-average trading prices for Dean Foods common stock and WhiteWave common stock for the period ended on the second trading day preceding the WhiteWave spin-off and, therefore, the ratio used to adjust these awards differs from the conversion ratio that would have resulted had the ratio been calculated based on the Dean Foods stock price immediately following the WhiteWave spin-off. As a result of this modification, we recorded additional stock compensation expense of $67 millionduring the year ended December31, 2013.The impact of the conversion on our outstanding equity awards, and the related share-based compensation expense, is summarized in the tables below.Stock RepurchasesSince 1998, our Board of Directors has from time to time authorized the repurchase of our common stock up to an aggregate of $23 billion, excluding fees and expenses. In November 2013, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our total share repurchase authorization to approximately $238 billion, resulting in remaining availability for repurchases of approximately $300 millionexcluding fees and commissions. Our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market transactions at prevailing prices or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. Shares, when repurchased, are retired. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for share repurchases in a strategic manner as a mechanism for generating additional shareholder value.We made noshare repurchases during the year ended December31, 2013. The following table summarizes the share repurchase activity for 2014 in thousands, except per share data:2014Number of shares repurchased1,727Weighted average purchase price per share$1445Amount of share repurchases$25,000Stock Award Plans As of December31, 2014, we had three award plans with remaining shares available for issuance. These plans, which are our 1997 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, the 1989 Dean Foods Company Stock Awards Plan which we adopted upon completion of our acquisition of Legacy Dean and the Dean Foods Company 2007 Stock Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan provide for grants of stock options, stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors and, in some cases, consultants, up to a maximum of 375 million, 57 millionand 123 millionshares, subject to adjustments as provided in these respective plans. Options and other stock-based awards vest in accordance with provisions set forth in the applicable award agreements. The remaining shares available for grant under the historical plans are granted pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2007 Plan. On May15, 2013, the 2007 Plan was amended and changed from one under which limits were placed on the number of shares that could be granted with respect to awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights Full Value Awards to one under which all authorized shares may be granted from a fungible share pool. Pursuant to the 2007 Plan, as amended, each share subject to any Full Value Award that is granted from the pool of available shares F-32Table of Contentswill count against the amended 2007 Plans share authorization as though 167shares of the Companys stock had been awarded. As of December31, 2014, we had approximately 1024 millionshares, in aggregate, available in the fungible share pool for issuance.Under our stock award plans, we grant stock options and restricted stock units to certain employees and directors. Non-employee directors also can elect to receive their directors fees in the form of restricted stock in lieu of cash.Stock OptionsUnder the terms of our stock option plans, employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase our stock at a price equal to the market price on the date the option is granted. In general, employee options vest one-third on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third on the third anniversary of the grant date.All unvested options vest immediately upon a change of control or in certain cases upon death or qualified disability. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately.We recognize share-based compensation expense for stock options ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, using the following assumptions:Year Ended December312012Expected volatility44%Expected dividend yield%Expected option term5 yearsRisk-free rate of return062to089The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to contractual terms generally 10 years, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee and director behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and expectations with regard to future volatility. The risk-free rates are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. We have not historically declared or paid a regular cash dividend on our common stock. Prior stock option awards are not impacted by our decision in 2013 to begin paying dividends in 2014.We did not grant any stock options during 2013or 2014, nor do we plan to in 2015.The following table summarizes stock option activity during the year ended December31,  outstanding at January1, 20145,055,035$1935Forfeited and  outstanding at December31,  vested and expected to vest at December31,  exercisable at December31, 20134,721,9481998Options exercisable at December31,  to the terms or our stock option plans, options that are forfeited or canceled may be available for future grants. Effective May 15, 2013, any stock options surrendered or canceled in satisfaction of participants' exercise proceeds or tax withholding obligation will no longer become available for future grants under the plans.F-33Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes information about options outstanding and exercisable at December31,  ExercisableRange ofExercise  to  to  to  to  to  following table summarizes additional information regarding our stock option activity in thousands, except per share amounts:Year Ended  per share grant date fair value of options granted 544Intrinsic value of options exercised2,0789,5406,084Fair value of shares vested4,7174,08412,580Tax benefit related to stock option expense1692,5342,661During the year ended December31, 2014, net cash received from stock option exercises was $95 millionand the total cash benefit for tax deductions to be realized for these option exercises was $08 million.At December31, 2014, there was $01 millionof total unrecognized stock option expense, all of which is related to unvested awards. This compensation expense is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 019 years.Restricted Stock UnitsWe issue restricted stock units RSUs to certain senior employees and non-employee directors as part of our long-term incentive program. An RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock in the future. RSUs have no exercise price. RSUs granted to employees generally vest ratably over three years, subject to certain accelerated vesting provisions based primarily on a change of control, or in certain cases upon death or qualified disability. RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over three years.The following table summarizes RSU activity during the year ended December31, 2014:EmployeesDirectors 1TotalRSUs outstanding January 1, 2014680,01796,273776,290RSUs  issued upon  canceled or  outstanding at December31,  per share grant date fair  stock units include Restricted Stock Awards RSAs, which participate in declared dividends2Pursuant to the terms of our stock unit plans, employees have the option of forfeiting stock units to cover their minimum statutory tax withholding when shares are issued.

This compensation expense is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 163 years.Restricted StockWe offer our non-employee directors the option to receive their compensation for services rendered in either cash or shares of restricted stock equal to 150%of the fee amount. Shares of restricted stock vest one-third on grant, one-third on the first anniversary of grant and one-third on the second anniversary of grant.The following table summarizes restricted stock activity during the year ended December31,  at January 1, 201424,199$2276Restricted shares granted40,0361627Restricted shares vested25,0012026Restricted shares forfeitedUnvested at December31, 201439,2341782Cash Performance Units We grant awards of cash performance units CPUs as part of our long-term incentive compensation program under the terms of our 2007 Plan. The CPU awards are cash-settled awards and are designed to link compensation of certain executive officers and other key employees to our performance over a three-year period. The performance metric for the 2011 and 2012 CPUs, as defined in the award agreements, is the performance of our stock price relative to that of a peer group of companies.The range of payout under the CPU awards is between 0%and 200%and is payable in cash at the end of each respective performance period. The fair value of the awards is remeasured at each reporting period. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period with a corresponding liability, which is recorded in other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the 1,526,250CPU awards outstanding as of December31, 2012, which were granted in 2011 and 2012, were converted and paid out during the year ended December31, 2013. Noawards with respect to those years remained outstanding at December31, 2014.For CPU awards granted in 2013 and 2014, the Compensation Committee changed the performance metric to bank earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization Bank EBITDA. Bank EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization plus all non-cash expenses. As the underlying value of these awards is not derived from or linked to our stock price, these awards are not share-based in nature and accordingly they have been excluded from the table above.F-35Table of ContentsPhantom Shares We grant phantom shares as part of our long-term incentive compensation program, which are similar to RSUs in that they are based on the price of our stock and vest ratably over a three-year period, but are cash-settled based upon the value of our stock at each vesting period. The fair value of the awards is remeasured at each reporting period. Compensation expense, which is variable, is recognized over the vesting period with a corresponding liability, which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

EARNINGS LOSS PER SHAREBasic earnings loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding and the effect of all dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during each period. Stock option conversions and stock units were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for the year ended December31, 2014 as we incurred a loss for this period and any effect on loss per share would have been anti-dilutive. All applicable share data and per share amounts for the year ended December31, 2012 has been adjusted retroactively for the 1-for-2 reverse stock split effected on August26, 2013.

See Note 11for further information regarding our interest rate swaps15. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANSWe sponsor various defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans, including various employee savings and profit sharing plans, and contribute to various multiemployer pension plans on behalf of our employees. Substantially all full-time union and non-union employees who have completed one or more years of serviceand have met other requirements pursuant to the plans are eligible to participate in one or more of these plans. During 2014, 2013and 2012, our retirement and profit sharing plan expenses were as follows:Year Ended December31201420132012In thousandsDefined benefit  contribution  pension and certain union  Benefit PlansThe benefits under our defined benefit plans are based on years of service and employee compensation. Our funding policy is to contribute annually the minimum amount required under ERISA regulations plus additional amounts as we deem appropriate.F-38Table of ContentsIncluded in accumulated other comprehensive income at December31, 2014and 2013are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service costs of $38 million$23 millionnet of tax and $35 million$21 millionnet of tax and unrecognized actuarial losses of $1287 million$793 millionnet of tax and $868 million$531 millionnet of tax, respectively.

We consider historical performance and current benchmarks to arrive at expected long-term rates of return in each asset category.The amortization of unrecognized net loss represents the amortization of investment losses incurred. The effect of settlement costs in 2014, 2013and 2012represents the recognition of net periodic benefit cost related to pension settlements reached as a result of plant closures.Pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets follows:December3120142013In millionsProjected benefit  benefit obligation34132794Fair value of plan assets28952583The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was $3413 millionand $2906 millionat December31, 2014and 2013, respectively.Almost 90%of our defined benefit plan obligations are frozen as to future participation or increases in projected benefit obligation. Many of these obligations were acquired in prior strategic transactions. As an alternative to defined benefit plans, we offer defined contribution plans for eligible employees.The weighted average discount rate reflects the rate at which our defined benefit plan obligations could be effectively settled. The rate, which is updated annually with the assistance of an independent actuary, uses a model that reflects a bond yield curve. Substantially all of our qualified pension plans are consolidated into one master trust. Our investment objectives are to minimize the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to our pension liabilities and to ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits. In 2014, we adopted a broad pension de-risking strategy intended to align the characteristics of our assets relative to our liabilities. The strategy targets investments depending on the funded status of the obligation. We anticipate this strategy will continue in future years and will be dependent upon market conditions and plan characteristics.F-40Table of ContentsAt December31, 2014, our master trust was invested as follows: investments in equity securitieswere at 50%; investments in fixed income were at49%; cash equivalents were at 1%and other investments were less than 1%. We believe the allocation of our master trust investments as of December31, 2014is generally consistent with the targets set forth by the Investment Committee.Estimated pension plan benefit payments to participants for the next ten years are as  five years1057millionFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering assumptions, we follow a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value of our defined benefit plans consolidated assets as follows:Level 1Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.Level 2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.Level 3Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.The fair values by category of inputs as of December31, 2014were as follows in thousands:Fair Value as of December31, 2014Level1Level 2Level3Equity Securities:Common Stock$210$210$$Index Funds:U.S.  EquitiesEquity Fundsb8,1018,101Total Equity  Income:Bond  Fundsd2,9212,921Total Fixed Income143,635140,7142,921Cash Equivalents:Short-term Investment Fundse2,5072,507Total Cash Equivalents2,5072,507Other  Venturesf567567Total Other  a pooled/separate account that tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index.F-41Table of ContentsbRepresents a pooled/separate account comprised of approximately 90%U.S. large-cap stocks and 10%in international stocks.cRepresents investments primarily in US dollar-denominated, investment grade bonds, including government securities, corporate bonds, and mortgage- and asset-backed securities.dRepresents a pooled/separate account investment in the General Investment Account of an investment manager.

The common stock investments held directly by the plans are actively traded and fair values are determined based on quoted prices in active markets and are therefore classified as Level 1 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.Fair values of equity securities held through units of pooled or index funds are based on net asset value NAV of the units of the funds as determined by the fund manager. These funds are similar in nature to retail mutual funds, but are typically more efficient for institutional investors than retail mutual funds. The fair value of pooled funds is determined by the value of the underlying assets held by the fund and the units outstanding. The values of the pooled funds are not directly observable, but are based on observable inputs and, accordingly, have been classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.Fair values of fixed income bond funds are typically determined by reference to the values of similar securities traded in the marketplace and current interest rate levels. Multiple pricing services are typically employed to assist in determining these valuations. These investments are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as all significant inputs into the valuation are readily observable in the marketplace. Investments in diversified funds and investments in partnerships/joint ventures are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as their fair value is dependent on inputs and assumptions which are not readily observable in the marketplace.A reconciliation of the change in the fair value measurement of the defined benefit plans consolidated assets using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 during the years ended December31, 2014and 2013is as follows in  at December31, 2012$2,938$1,447$4,385Actual return on plan assets:Relating to instruments still held at reporting date119306187Purchases, sales and settlements net828828Transfers in and/or out of Level 3864277587Balance at December31, 2013$3,093$864$3,957Actual return on plan assets:Relating to instruments still held at reporting date11715841Purchases, sales and settlements net1,8361,836Transfers in and/or out of Level 31,5471391,408Balance at December31, 2014$2,921$567$3,488Defined Contribution Plans Certain of our non-union personnel may elect to participate in savings and profit sharing plans sponsored by us. These plans generally provide for salary reduction contributions to the plans on behalf of the participants of between 1%and 20%of a participants annual compensation and provide for employer matching and profit sharing contributions as determined by our Board of Directors. In addition, certain union hourly employees are participants in company-sponsored defined contribution plans, which provide for salary reduction contributions according to several schedules, including as a percentage of salary, various cents per hour and flat dollar amounts. Additionally, employer contributions are sometimes, although not always, provided according to various schedules ranging from flat dollar contributions to matching contributions as a percent of salary based on the employees deferral election.Multiemployer Pension PlansCertain of our subsidiaries contribute to various multiemployer pension and other postretirement benefit plans which cover a majority of our full-time union employees and certain of our part-time union employees. Such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of labor representatives and the management of the participating companies. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; andIf we choose to stop participating in one or more of our multiemployer plans, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.F-43Table of ContentsAt this time, we have not established any significant liabilities because withdrawal from these plans is not probable or reasonably possible.Our participation in these multiemployer plans for the year ended December31, 2014is outlined in the table below. Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Protection Act PPA Zone Status available in 2014and 2013is for the plans year-end at December31, 2013and December31, 2012, respectively. The zone status is based on information that we obtained from each plans Form 5500, which is available in the public domain and is certified by the plans actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65%funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80%funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80%funded. The FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented column indicates plans for which a funding improvement plan FIP or a rehabilitation plan RP is either pending or has been implemented. Federal law requires that plans classified in the yellow zone or red zone adopt a funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan, respectively, in order to improve the financial health of the plan. The Extended Amortization Provisions column indicates plans which have elected to utilize the special 30-year amortization rules provided by the Pension Relief Act of 2010 to amortize its losses from 2008 as a result of turmoil in the financial markets. The last column in the table lists the expiration dates of the collective-bargaining agreements to which the plans are subject.Pension  Conference of Teamsters Pension  28, 2015 - May 31,  Southwest Areas Pension  15, 2015 - April 30, 2017Retail, Wholesale Department Store International Union and Industry Pension  7, 2015 - September 30, 2017Dairy Industry Union Pension Plan for Philadelphia  30, 2017 March 31, 20181We are party to approximately 18collective bargaining agreements that require contributions to this plan. These agreements cover a large number of employee participants and expire on various dates between 2015 and 2017. We do not believe that any one agreement is substantially more significant than another as none of these agreements individually represent greater than 25%of the total employee participants covered under this plan2There are approximately 21collective bargaining agreements that govern our participation in this plan. The agreements expire on various dates between 2015 and 2017. Approximately 17%, 69%and 14%of our employee participants in this plan are covered by the agreements expiring in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively3We are subject to approximately eightcollective bargaining agreements with respect to this plan. Approximately 50%, 4%and 46%of our employee participants in this plan are covered by the agreements expiring in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively4We are party to fourcollective bargaining agreements with respect to this plan. The agreement expiring in September 2017 is the most significant as 69%of our employee participants in this plan are covered by that agreement.F-44Table of ContentsInformation regarding our contributions to our multiemployer pension plans is shown in the table below. There are no changes which materially affected the comparability of our contributions to each of these plans during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012.Pension   Conference of Teamsters Pension  States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension  Wholesale Department Store International Union and Industry Pension  Industry Union Pension Plan for Philadelphia  Funds2081417Total  the 2013 and 2012 plan years, our contributions to these plans exceeded 5% of total plan contributions.

The amount of the surcharge is equal to a percentage of the amount we would otherwise be required to contribute to the plan and ceases once our related collective bargaining agreements are amended to comply with the provisions of the rehabilitation plan16. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONSCertain of our subsidiaries provide health care benefits to certain retirees who are covered under specific group contracts. As defined by the specific group contract, qualified covered associates may be eligible to receive major medical insurance with deductible and co-insurance provisions subject to certain lifetime maximums.Included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December31, 2014and 2013are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit cost: unrecognized prior service costs of $6775 thousand$4153 thousandnet of tax and $7420 thousand$4530 thousandnet of tax and unrecognized actuarial losses of $31 million$19 millionnet of tax and $23 million$14 millionnet of tax, respectively.

ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND FACILITY CLOSING AND REORGANIZATION COSTSAsset Impairment ChargesWe evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment could include, among other factors, significant changes in the business environment or the planned closure of a facility. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows. As a result of certain changes to our business, including the loss of a portion of a significant customers volume and related plans for consolidating our production network, during the years ended December31, 2014and December31, 2013, we evaluated the impact that we expected these changes to have on our projected future cash flows. This analysis identified indicators of impairment at certain of our production facilities and therefore we were required to test the assets at those facilities for recoverability.Testing the assets for recoverability involved developing estimates of future cash flows directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of the assets. The inputs for the fair value calculations were based on assessment of an individual assets alternative use within other production facilities, evaluation of recent market data and historical liquidation sales values for similar assets. As the inputs into these calculations are largely based on managements judgments and are not generally observable in active markets, we consider such measurements to be Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 11.The results of our analysis indicated impairments of our plant, property and equipment of approximately $208 millionand noimpairments related to certain intangible assets. All of these charges were recorded during the year ended December31, 2014and are reflected in the impairment of long-lived assets line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended December31, 2013we recorded impairments of our plant, property and equipment of approximately $355 millionand impairments related to certain intangible assets of approximately $79 million, which are described more fully in Note 7. We can provide no assurance that we will not have impairment charges in future periods as a result of changes in our business environment, operating results or the assumptions and estimates utilized in our impairment tests.F-47Table of ContentsFacility Closing and Reorganization CostsApproved plans within our multi-year initiatives and related charges are summarized as follows:Year  thousandsClosure of  Realignment289232,219Field and Functional  charges in 2014, 2013and 2012primarily relate to facility closures in Riverside, California; Delta, Colorado; Denver, Colorado; Dallas, Texas; Waco, Texas; Springfield, Virginia; Buena Park, California; Evart, Michigan; Bangor, Maine; Shreveport, Louisiana; Mendon, Massachusetts, and Sheboygan, Wisconsin; as well as other approved closures. We have incurred $440 millionof charges to date related to our active restructuring initiatives. We expect to incur additional charges related to these facility closures of $69 million, related to contract termination, shutdown and other costs. As we continue the evaluation of our supply chain and distribution network, it is likely that we will close additional facilities in the future2The Functional Realignment initiative was focused on aligning key functions within our legacy Fresh Dairy Direct operations under a single leadership team and permanently removing certain costs from the organization. We have incurred total charges of approximately $331 millionunder this initiative to date and we do not expect to incur any material future charges related to this plan3The Field and Functional Reorganization initiative streamlined the leadership structure and has enabled faster decision-making and created enhanced opportunities to strategically build our business. We have incurred total charges of $113 millionunder this plan to date, all of which were associated with headcount reductions. We do not currently anticipate incurring any material charges under this plan going forward.Activity for 2014and 2013with respect to facility closing and reorganization costs is summarized below and includes items expensed as incurred:Accrued Charges atDecember31, 2012Charges and AdjustmentsPaymentsAccrued Charges atDecember31, 2013Charges and AdjustmentsPaymentsAccrued Charges atDecember31, 2014InthousandsCash charges:Workforce reduction   obligations after  charges:Write-down of  on sale of related assets3,8584,754Other, net447841Total charges$27,008$4,4601The write-down of assets relates primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment of those facilities identified for closure. The assets were tested for recoverability at the time the decision to close the facilities was more likely than not to occur.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESContingent Obligations Related to Divested OperationsWe have divested certain businesses in prior years. In each case, we have retained certain known contingent obligations related to those businesses and/or assumed an obligation to indemnify the purchasers of the businesses for certain unknown contingent liabilities, including environmental liabilities. We believe that we have established adequate reserves, which are immaterial to the financial statements, for potential liabilities and indemnifications related to our divested businesses. Moreover, we do not expect any liability that we may have for these retained liabilities, or any indemnification liability, to materially exceed amounts accrued.Contingent Obligations Related to Milk Supply ArrangementsOn December21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Legacy Dean, we purchased Dairy Farmers of Americas DFA 338%interest in our operations. In connection with that transaction, we issued a contingent, subordinated promissory note to DFA in the original principal amount of $40 million. The promissory note has a 20-year term that bears interest based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash but will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a maximum principal amount of $96 million. We may prepay the note in whole or in part at any time, without penalty. The note will only become payable if we materially breach or terminate one of our related milk supply agreements with DFA without renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire in 2021, without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or interest. Payments made under the note, if any, would be expensed as incurred. We have not terminated, and we have not materially breached, any of our milk supply agreements with DFA related to the promissory note. We have previously terminated unrelated supply agreements with respect to several plants that were supplied by DFA. In connection with our goals of accelerated cost control and increased supply chain efficiency, we continue to evaluate our sources of raw milk supply.InsuranceWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks, including property, workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and employee health care utilizing high deductibles. Deductibles vary due to insurance market conditions and risk. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions. Based on current information, we believe that we have established adequate reserves to cover these claims. At December31, 2014and 2013, we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of $1479 millionand $1464 million, respectively, including both current and long-term liabilities.Lease and Purchase ObligationsWe lease certain property, plant and equipment used in our operations under both capital and operating lease agreements. Such leases, which are primarily for machinery, equipment and vehicles, including our distribution fleet, have lease terms ranging from oneto 20years. Certain of the operating lease agreements require the payment of additional rentals for maintenance, along with additional rentals based on miles driven or units produced. Certain leases require us to guarantee a minimum value of the leased asset at the end of the lease. Our maximum exposure under those guarantees is not a material amount. Rent expense was $1189 million, $1247 millionand $1262 millionfor 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively.F-49Table of ContentsFuture minimum payments at December31, 2014, under non-cancelable operating leases and capital leases with terms in excess of one year are summarized  minimum lease payments$288,112We have entered into various contracts, in the normal course of business, obligating us to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production and distribution processes, including conventional raw milk, diesel fuel, sugar and other ingredients that are inputs into our finished products. We enter into these contracts from time to time to ensure a sufficient supply of raw ingredients. In addition, we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production process.Litigation, Investigations and AuditsWe are not party to, nor are our properties the subject of, any material pending legal proceedings, other than as set forth below:Tennessee Retailer and Indirect Purchaser ActionsA putative class action antitrust complaint the retailer action was filed on August9, 2007 in the UnitedStates District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Plaintiffs allege generally that we, either acting alone or in conjunction with others in the milk industry who are also defendants in the retailer action, lessened competition in the Southeastern United States for the sale of processed fluid Grade A milk to retail outlets and other customers, and that the defendants conduct also artificially inflated wholesale prices for direct milk purchasers. Defendants motion for summary judgment in the retailer action was granted in part and denied in part in August 2010. Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration on September10, 2010, and filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment as to the remaining claims on September27, 2010. On March27, 2012, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants as to all remaining counts and entered judgment in favor of all defendants, including the Company. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on April25, 2012. On May30, 2012, the Company participated in a scheduling conference and mediation conducted by the appeals court. The mediation did not result in a settlement agreement. Briefing on the appeal was completed on April5, 2013, oral argument occurred on July25, 2013. On January3, 2014, the appeals court reversed the judgment for the defendants, including the Company, on one of the original five counts in the Tennessee Retailer Action. In February 2014, the Company requested that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals consider its decision en banc; the Sixth Circuit declined to do so. The Sixth Circuit returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The Company filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for review of the case on August 1, 2014. The Supreme Court denied the petition on November 17, 2014. The trial court has not yet issued a schedule for further proceedings.On June29, 2009, another putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Eastern District of Tennessee, Greeneville Division, on behalf of indirect purchasers of processed fluid Grade A milk the indirect purchaser action. The allegations in this complaint are similar to those in the retailer action, but primarily involve state law claims. Because the allegations in the indirect purchaser action substantially overlap with the allegations in the retailer action, the Court granted the parties joint motion to stay all proceedings in the indirect purchaser action pending the outcome of the summary judgment motions in the retailer action. On August16, 2012, the indirect purchaser plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit. On January17, 2013, these same plaintiffs filed a new lawsuit in the Eastern District of Tennessee, Greeneville Division, on behalf of a putative class of indirect purchasers of processed fluid Grade A milk the 2013 indirect purchaser action. The allegations are similar to those in the voluntarily dismissed indirect purchaser action, but involve only claims arising under Tennessee law. The Company filed a motion to dismiss on April30, 2013. On June14, 2013, the indirect purchaser plaintiffs responded to the Companys motion to dismiss and filed an amended complaint. On July1, 2013, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On September 11, 2014, the Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss.

SEGMENT, GEOGRAPHIC AND CUSTOMER INFORMATIONWe operate as a single reportable segment in manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing a wide variety of branded and private label dairy case products. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, we combined the results of our ongoing dairy operations previously referred to as our Fresh Dairy Direct business and the corporate items previously categorized as Corporate and Other into a single reportable segment, as all of our corporate activities now directly support this business. This change reflects the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, determines strategy and investment plans for our business given the changes to our operating structure as a result of the WhiteWave spin-off and the Morningstar sale.We operate 68manufacturing facilities geographically located largely based on local and regional customer needs and other market factors. We manufacture, market and distribute a wide variety of branded and private label dairy case products, including milk, ice cream, cultured dairy products, creamers, ice cream mix and other dairy products to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, educational institutions and governmental entities across the United States. Our products are primarily delivered through what we believe to be one of the most extensive refrigerated direct store delivery DSD systems in the United States.In December 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell Morningstar, and we completed the sale of these operations on January3, 2013. The operating results of Morningstar, previously reported within the Morningstar segment, have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. Additionally, as a result of the completion of the WhiteWave spin-off on May23, 2013, we have reclassified WhiteWaves operating results as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. All intersegment sales between WhiteWave, Morningstar and us, previously recorded as intersegment sales and eliminated in consolidation, prior to the Morningstar divestiture and WhiteWave spin-off, are now reflected as third-party sales that, along with their related costs, are no longer eliminated in consolidation. See Notes 2and 3, respectively, for further information regarding the WhiteWave spin-off, Morningstar divestiture and our discontinued operations.Our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of our business based on sales and operating income or loss before gains and losses on the sale of businesses, facility closing and reorganization costs, litigation settlements, impairments of long-lived assets and other non-recurring gains and losses.All results herein have been recast to present results on a comparable basis. These changes had no impact on consolidated net sales and operating income. The amounts in the following tables include our operating results and are obtained from reports used by our executive management team and do not include any allocated income taxes or management fees. There are no significant non-cash items reported in segment profit or loss other than depreciation and amortization.F-51Table of ContentsYear Ended December31,201420132012in thousandsOperating income:Dean  closing and reorganization   other long-lived assets20,82043,441Other operating income  income expense:Interest  on early retirement of debt1,43763,387Gain on disposition of WhiteWave common stock415,783Other income,  income loss from continuing operations before income  Information Net sales related to our foreign operations comprised less than 1%of our consolidated net sales during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012.
