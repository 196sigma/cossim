INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
PixTech, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PixTech, Inc.
a development stage company as of December 31, 1995 and 1996 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
the period from June 18, 1992 date of inception through December 31, 1996 and
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of PixTech, Inc. a development stage company as of December 31, 1995 and
1996 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the
period June 18, 1992 date of inception through December 31, 1996 and for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

PIXTECH, INC.
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY
PixTech, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on October 27,
1993. On November 30, 1993, PixTech, Inc. acquired 100% beneficial ownership
of PixTech S.A., through a share exchange agreement. PixTech S.A. was
incorporated under the laws of France on June 18, 1992. For accounting
purposes, the acquisition has been treated as a recapitalization of PixTech
S.A. As used herein, the Company refers to PixTech, Inc. and PixTech S.A.
The Company was founded to improve, utilize and license certain background
technology developed by LETI Laboratoire Electronique de Technologie et
d'Instrumentation, a French government-owned research and development
laboratory in the field of flat panel displays using electron emitters, known
as field emission displays FEDs.
The Company has devoted substantially all its efforts to raising capital,
conducting research and development activities, recruiting personnel,
establishing a pilot manufacturing facility and forming an alliance of
industrial partners the FED Alliance. Revenues from principal planned
operations will consist of product sales and royalties on the sale of FEDs
produced by members of the FED Alliance. As these revenues have not commenced,
PixTech, Inc. is still in a development stage and falls under the provisions
of FAS No. 7 Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises.
2. SUMMARY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of
financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PixTech, Inc.
and its wholly owned subsidiary PixTech S.A. Intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year
The Company ends its financial year on December 31.
Revenue recognition--Cooperation and License Agreements
The Company has entered into Cooperation and License agreements with members
of the FED Alliance. Under these contracts, the Company shares technology with
such members through cross licensing provisions. Each contract provides for
certain fees and royalties to be paid to the Company. The Company believes
that each of the cooperation and license agreements are long-term

Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of PixTech S.A. are translated into U.S. dollar
equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date;
income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing
during the period. The related translation adjustments are reflected in
stockholders' equity. Foreign currency gains or losses resulting from
transactions are included in results of operations, except for transaction
gains and losses attributable to intercompany transactions, and for foreign
currency transactions or cash balances that hedge foreign currency
commitments; such transactions and cash balances are recorded in the same
manner as translation adjustments, as recommended by the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No 52, Foreign currency translation SFAS
52.
Net Income Loss Per Share
Net income loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of
shares, convertible preferred shares assuming conversion at date of issuance,
and dilutive equivalent shares from stock options and warrants using the
treasury stock method. Pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Staff Accounting Bulletins, shares and equivalent shares issued by the Company
at prices below the assumed public offering price during the twelve-month
period prior to the proposed offering have been included in the calculation as
if they were outstanding for all periods presented through the period in which
the initial public offering took place using the treasury stock method and
assuming an initial public offering price. Net income loss per share also
reflects for all periods presented a 2 for 3 reverse stock split which was
effective at the closing of the Company initial public offering.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Per Share amounts for the periods after the initial public offering have
been calculated in accordance with the provisions of APB 15.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Investments
At January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities SFAS 115. The cumulative effect as of January 1, 1994, of
adopting SFAS No 115 is considered to be immaterial. Under SFAS 115,
investments are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the
positive intent an ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-
maturity securities are stated at amortized cost with corresponding premiums
or discounts amortized over the life of the investment to interest income.
Trading securities are reported at fair value and unrecognized gains or losses
are included in earnings. Marketable equity and debt securities not classified
as held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale
and reported at fair value. Unrecognized gains or losses on available-for-sale
securities are included, net of tax, in equity until their disposition.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-
temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in net income. The
cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.
The Company had no investments at December 31, 1996 or 1995. There were no
realized gains or losses on sales of investments in 1996 or 1995.
Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost first-in, first-out basis or
market. Inventory consists of raw material and spare parts.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Depreciation
and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, generally five years for equipment, ten years for
building improvements and twenty years for buildings. Equipment financed under
capital leases are depreciated over the shorter of estimated useful life and
lease term. Amortization expense is included with depreciation expense.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In January 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, which establishes criteria for the
recognition and measurement of impairment loss associated with long-lived
assets. Adoption of FAS 121 did not have a material impact on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
Patents and Other Intangible Assets
Patent application and establishment costs are expensed as incurred as
research and development costs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
The carrying value of intangible assets are reviewed on an ongoing basis to
assess if facts or circumstances suggest that the Company intangible assets
may be impaired. If this review indicates that intangible assets will not be
recoverable, as determined based on the expected future cash flows to be
generated by these assets over their remaining amortization period, the
Company carrying value of the intangible assets is reduced by the estimated
shortfall of discounted cash flows.
Employee Stock Option Plans
In 1996, the Company adopted the disclosure provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards Ndegrees 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company has elected
to continue to account for its employee stock option plans and the Employee
Stock Purchase Plans in accordance with the provisions of the Accounting
Principles Board Ndegrees 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.
Accounting for Income Taxes
The Company uses the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Pension Costs
In France, legislation requires that lump sum retirement indemnities be paid
to employees based upon their years of services and compensation at
retirement. The actuarial liability of this unfunded obligation as at December
31, 1995 and 1996 is $18 and $32 respectively. Pension expense incurred was $5
in 1994, $13 in 1995 and $14 in 1996.

In 1994, the Company entered into capital lease agreements for production
equipment. The gross and net book values of equipment financed under capital
leases amounted $4,680 and $3,452 respectively at December 31, 1995 and $4,409
and $2,207 at December 31, 1996 respectively.
At December 31, 1995 machinery and equipment included $671 of equipment on
which the Company and LETI each had a 50% title. This equipment was recorded
by the Company at 50% of its cost and was depreciated based on this
acquisition value. On March 22, 1996, the Company entered into an agreement
with LETI under which i certain pieces of equipment, with an acquisition
value and a net value in the Company books of $380 and $240 at March 31,
1996, respectively, became the sole property of the Company; these assets were
then recorded in the Company books with an acquisition value of $509, and
are now depreciated over their remaining expected lifetime; and ii certain
pieces of equipment with an acquisition value and a net value in The Company
books of $336 and $238, respectively, became the sole property of LETI.
On November 15, 1996, an agreement was executed between Steag MicroTech GmbH
SMT and the Company the SMT agreement, in order to settle technical
acceptance issues related to a piece of equipment acquired in 1994 from SMT
for an amount of $850. Under the SMT agreement, SMT waived the balance payable
under a loan $421 granted by SMT to the Company at the time of the equipment
purchase. In return, the Company waived future claims on this piece of
equipment. The Company recorded in Other Revenues a net gain of $148 from
this transaction representing the $421 forgiveness of debt less a $273 write-
down of the carrying value of the equipment due to permanent impairment of
value.
5. GOODWILL
On February 20, 1996, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of
PanoCorp, Inc., a research and development company located in California, in a
transaction accounted for as a purchase. The assets of PanoCorp, Inc.,
including principally fixed assets valued at $120, were purchased for $250 in
cash plus 150,000 warrants to purchase shares of the Company common stock at
an exercise price of $1167 per share. See Note 13. Stockholders' Equity Warrants.
The fair value of the 150,000 warrants was computed using the Black-Scholes
model. Pursuant to the APB Statement 16, the value of such warrants was
estimated at $230 and the global transaction generated goodwill of $360. This
goodwill is depreciated over 5 years.
The purchase agreement also calls for the issuance of up to 600,000
additional warrants to the shareholders of PanoCorp, Inc., contingent upon the
achievement by the Company of specified technical milestones over the next 3
years. No such warrants have been issued at December 31, 1996.
6. DEFERRED OFFERING COSTS

11. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
At December 31, 1996, the carrying values of financial instruments such as
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and payable, other receivables
and accrued liabilities and the current portion of long-term debt approximated
their market values, based on the short-term maturities of these instruments.
At December 31, 1995 and 1996, the fair values of long-term debt and other
long-term liabilities, with book value of $6,865 and $3,517 were $5,607 and
$3,128 respectively. Fair value is determined based on expected future cash
flows, discounted at market interest rates, and other appropriate valuation
methodologies.
12. LITIGATION
In May 1994, an individual commenced a lawsuit in France against the
Commissariat--l'Energie Atomique CEA and the Company alleging infringement
of a French patent the Patent. In addition to the French patent, the
plaintiff held patents in the United States and through the European Patent
Office the EPO, in each case concerning a specific method for addressing a
display which uses microtips through the screen controller. The decision of
the judge made in November 1996 was that only the electronic circuitry used by
the Company to drive the panels was infringing the Patent. Therefore, CEA and
PixTech were barred from producing, using or selling this electronic circuitry
as well as FED displays including such circuitry in France. CEA notified the
Company in January 1997 that CEA had acquired the Patent, as well as all its
extensions outside France from such individual, and that, under the license
agreement between CEA and the Company, the Company would get an exclusive
license to the recently acquired patents, with a right to sublicense.
In accordance with the Company license agreement with the CEA, the CEA has
assumed responsibility for the cost of common defense counsel, and has assumed
settlement cost with the plaintiff, with the exception of approximately $40
that the Company has agreed to assume as a contribution to such settlement.
13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
The share amounts and per share dollar amounts included herein reflect the
effect of the 2 for 3 reverse stock split which was effective on July 18,
1995.
Common Stock
On July 18, 1995, the Company sold 2,500,000 shares of common stock for net
proceeds of $20,998 in its initial public offering on Nasdaq. At December 31,
1996, all outstanding shares are shares of Common Stock.
Convertible preferred stock
All of the Company issued shares of Convertible Preferred Stock
automatically converted into shares of Common Stock upon the closing of the
Company initial public offering. There is no longer any Convertible
Preferred Stock outstanding.
Preferred Stock
The Company Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000
shares of Preferred Stock and to fix the relative rights thereof.

Stock Options
The Company has elected to follow APB 25 in accounting for its employee
stock options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under SFAS 123 requires the use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.
Under APB 25, when the exercise price of the Company employee stock options
is less than the market price of the underlying shares of the date of grant,
compensation expenses is recognized.
The Company adopted a stock option plan on November 30, 1993 which was
amended and restated in May 1995, under which options to purchase shares of
common stock may be granted to key employees and consultants of the Company.
The plan provides that the option price shall be determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and that no portion of the
option may be exercised beyond ten years from the date of grant. Options which
are outstanding at December 31, 1996, become exercisable within a certain
period of time or when specific milestones are completed.
During the twelve months prior to the Company initial public offering, the
Company issued stock options for its Common Stock pursuant to its stock option
plan at exercise prices substantially below the initial public offering price.
Specifically, the Company granted options exercisable for an aggregate of
20,467 shares in December 1994 with an exercise price of $38 per share and
for an aggregate of 466,667 shares with an exercise price of $75 per share.
Such option prices were determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors to be equal to fair market value of a share of the underlying
Common Stock on the date of grant of the options.
Prior to the Company initial public offering, determinations of the fair
market value of a share of the Company Common Stock were made in connection
with each option grant by the Compensation Committee after careful review of
relevant factors affecting the value of the Company Common Stock. The
following factors were among those considered by the Compensation Committee:
i the subordination of the Company Common Stock to its several series of
Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, liquidation
preferences, voting control, antidilution rights and other rights and
privileges, ii the Company financial condition and results of operations
most notably, the Company operating losses and the fact that the Company
tangible net worth was less than the liquidation preference of the outstanding
Convertible Preferred Stock, iii the sale of Series C and D Convertible
Preferred Stock at a price of $288 per share and iv the absence of a public
market for the Company securities. After the Company successfully produced a
defect-free prototype from its pilot manufacturing plant in February 1995,
resulting in serious negotiations with Motorola to join the FED Alliance, and
commenced discussions with investment bankers which led to the Company
initial public offering, the Company priced its next option grant for 10,000
shares in May 1995 at $765 per share, representing 85% of the midpoint of the
proposed initial public offering price range.

weighted-average exercise prices of $0375 and $0415 respectively, at
December 31, 1995 and 1996.
Exercise prices for options outstanding as of December 31, 1996 ranged from
$0375 to $9750. The weighted average remaining contractual life of those
options is 801 years.
In May 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Director Stock Option Plan the
Director Stock Plan, which provides for the issuance of up to 50,000 shares
of the Company stock. The Director Stock Plan provides for an automatic
grant of options to purchase the Company stock at its fair market value to
the non-employee directors of the Company upon election or re-election to the
Board of Directors. Under the Director Stock Plan a director was granted 6,000
options in April 1996 at an exercise price of $8625.
Pro forma information regarding net loss and loss per share is required by
SFAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its
employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair value
for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following average assumptions for both years:
risk-free interest rates of 3%; dividend yields of 0%; volatility factors of
the expected market price of the Company shares of Common Stock of 030; and
a weighted-average expected life of the option of 4 years.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the imput of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because the changes
in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of its employee stock options.

In February 1996, in order to finance partially the purchase of PanoCorp
assets, Inc., the Company granted 150,000 warrants to purchase shares of the
Company common stock at an exercise price of $1167 per share. See Note 5 Goodwill.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In May 1995, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan the
Purchase Plan under which employees may purchase shares of Common Stock at
a discount from fair market value. 100,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved
for issuance under the Purchase Plan. To date, no shares have been issued
under the Purchase Plan. Rights to purchase Common Stock under the Purchase
Plan are granted at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, which
determines the frequency and duration of individual offerings under the Plan
and the dates when the stock may be purchased. Eligible employees, which
represent all full-time employees as defined by the Purchase Plan,
participate voluntarily and may withdraw from any offering at any time before
the stock is purchased. The purchase price per share of Common Stock in an
offering is 85% of the lesser of its fair market value at the beginning of the
offering period or on the applicable exercise date and may be paid through
payroll deductions, periodic lump sum payments or a combination of both. The
Purchase Plan terminates on May 9, 2005.
At December 31, 1996 2,105,530 shares of Common Stock are reserved for
shares issuable under the Purchase Plan or upon exercise of stock options and
warrants.

17. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
Historically, the Company derived its revenues principally from members of
the FED Alliance. Net revenues from the FED Alliance customers represented
approximately 90%, 90% and 75% of the Company net revenues for the fiscal
years 1994, 1995 and 1996.
Revenues derived from FED Alliance members are of a non-recurring nature.
18. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In September 1992, the Company entered into a license agreement with CEA.
CEA is the French atomic energy agency, and holds a controlling interest in
CEA Industrie, a shareholder of the Company. Under this agreement, CEA granted
to the Company a royalty bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to all patents
held by CEA in the field of FEDs, with a right to sublicense these patents
under certain conditions. The consideration for this license is a payment of
license fees and royalties based on the Company sales and the license fees
and royalties collected by the Company. No expense was recorded in 1993 and
1994 in respect of license fees and royalties due to CEA. In 1995, $1,000 was
accrued in respect of license fees and royalties due to CEA in 1996. In order
for the Company to maintain an exclusive license, it was required to make
minimum royalty payments beginning in 1996. An amount of $45 payable to CEA in
1997 was accrued in 1996; this amount includes royalties obligations under the
license agreement and contribution to settlement of litigation see Note 12 Litigation. By paying the remaining amount due to LETI, the Company will
fulfill the minimum royalty obligations to LETI through 1998.
In September 1992, the Company entered into a three-year renewable R
agreement with CEA, under which CEA, through its laboratory LETI, performs
certain research and development activities for the benefit of the Company.
This program was extended for a second three-year period ending on January 1,
1999, subject to further extension by mutual agreement of the parties. The
consideration received by the CEA for this R activity in 1996 amounted to
approximately $640.
In connection with the above R agreement with CEA, the Company paid
$1,600, $1,700 and $644 in 1994, 1995 and 1996, of which $1,100, $1,300 and
$644 is included in research and development costs in 1994, 1995, and 1996
respectively. The balance primarily represents purchases of equipment, less
recoverable value added tax.
19. LICENSE
In connection with the Company license of its technology to an FED
Alliance member, the Company acquired a worldwide, non-exclusive royalty-free
license to such FED Alliance member background FED technology, as well as a
right to grant royalty-free sublicenses to the other FED Alliance members. The
Company is obligated to pay certain license fees in connection with the
acquisition of these rights from such FED Alliance member; these payments to
the FED Alliance member are $650 in 1995, $650 in 1996, and $700 in 1997. The
present value of this payment stream, discounted at a 10% interest rate, is
$1,654 and has been classified as an Other Long Term Liability and has been
expensed in 1994.
In connection with the Company license of its technology to another FED
Alliance member, the Company also acquired a worldwide, non-exclusive license,
without the right to sublicense, to certain technology of such FED Alliance
member. The Company is obligated to pay certain license fees in connection
with the acquisition of these rights; these payments to the FED Alliance
member are $1,000 in 1995, $1,000 in 1996, $1,000 in 1997

and $500 in 1998. The present value of this payment stream, discounted at a
10% interest rate, is $3,111 and has been classified as an Other Long Term
Liability and was expensed in 1995.
Total license fees to be paid are expensed in the year in which the
commitment is made due to the uncertainty regarding the recoverability of the
amounts paid arising from the unpredictability of future payments to be
received by the Company from such FED Alliance members in respect of the
license to such members of the Company technology.
