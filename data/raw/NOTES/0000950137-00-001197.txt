REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Tenneco Automotive Inc.   We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tenneco Automotive Inc.
a Delaware corporation and consolidated subsidiaries see Note 1 as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related statements of income, cash flows,
changes in shareholders' equity and comprehensive income for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements and the
schedule referred to below are the responsibility of Tenneco Automotive Inc.
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Tenneco Automotive Inc. and
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of
their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 1999 Tenneco
Automotive Inc. changed its methods of accounting for the costs of start-up
activities and for customer acquisition costs, and in 1997 changed its method of
accounting for certain costs incurred in connection with information technology
transformation projects.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental schedule of Tenneco
Automotive Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries is presented for purposes of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of
the basic financial statements. The supplemental schedule has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements
and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
of Tenneco Automotive Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole.

TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidation and Presentation
Tenneco Automotive Inc. was known as Tenneco Inc. before the spin-off on
November 4, 1999, of our packaging business to our shareholders, as described in
Note 2. In these notes, when we discuss Tenneco we mean Tenneco Inc. and its
subsidiaries before the spin-off and Tenneco Automotive Inc. and its
subsidiaries after the spin-off.
Our financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries. We carry
investments in 20% to 50% owned companies at cost plus equity in undistributed
earnings since the date of acquisition and cumulative translation adjustments.
We have eliminated all significant intercompany transactions.
Inventories
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, inventory by major classification was as
follows                                1999  1998

Finished  $215  $221
Work in   86   79
Raw   73   73

$412  $414
Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. A portion of
total inventories 30% and 28% at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively is
valued using the last-in, first-out method. If we had used the first-in,
first-out FIFO method of accounting for these inventories, they would have
been $21 million and $15 million higher at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. We value all other inventories using the FIFO or average cost
methods at the lower of cost or market value.
Goodwill and Intangibles, net
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, goodwill and intangibles, net of
amortization, by major category were as follows                                 1999  1998
MILLIONS
$485  $487
Other intangible    10   12
$495  $499
Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from 15 to 40 years. Goodwill amortization amounted to $17 million, $16 million,
and $14 million for 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively, and is included in the
statements of income caption Depreciation and amortization.
We have capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily trademarks and
patents, based on their estimated fair value at the date we acquired them. We
amortize these intangible assets on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from five to 30 years. Amortization of intangibles amounted to $3 million, $2
million, and $6 million in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively, and is included
in the statements of income caption Depreciation and amortization.

Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Short and long-term notes receivable outstanding were $26 million and $36
million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the allowance for doubtful accounts on short
and long-term accounts and notes receivable was $29 million and $39 million,
respectively.
Other Long-Term Assets
Prior to January 1, 1999, we capitalized certain costs we incurred in
connection with the acquisition of new customer contracts to sell our
aftermarket products. These new customer acquisition costs were incurred in
exchange for contracts in which the aftermarket customer agreed to purchase our
aftermarket products exclusively for periods of time ranging up to three years.
We amortized these costs over the initial contract period. At December 31, 1998,
the net capitalized costs related to these activities were $54 million. You
should also read Changes in Accounting Principles later in this note for more
information.
Before January 1, 1999, we capitalized certain costs related to start-up
activities, primarily pre-production design and development costs for new
automobile original equipment platforms, which are included in the 1998 balance
sheet caption Other assets -- Other. We amortized the pre-production design
and development costs over the life of the underlying supply agreements and
other start-up costs over the periods benefited, generally two years. Start-up
costs capitalized, net of amortization, at December 31, 1998, were $111 million
for continuing operations and $41 million for discontinued operations. You
should also read Changes in Accounting Principles later in this note for more
information.
Beginning on January 1, 1999, we began expensing pre-production design and
development costs as incurred unless we have a contractual guarantee for
reimbursement from the original equipment customer. At December 31, 1999 we had
long-term receivables of $10 million on the balance sheet for guaranteed
pre-production design and development reimbursement arrangements with our
customers. In addition, property, plant and equipment includes $56 million and
$63 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, for original equipment
tools and dies that we own, and prepayments and other includes $25 million and
$24 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, for in-process tools
and dies that we are building for our original equipment customers.
We capitalize certain costs related to the purchase and development of
software that we use in our business operations. We amortize the costs
attributable to these software systems over their estimated
50

TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
useful lives, ranging from three to 12 years, based on various factors such as
the effects of obsolescence, technology and other economic factors. Capitalized
software development costs, net of amortization, were $73 million at December
31, 1999 and were $67 million for continuing operations and $140 million for
discontinued operations at December 31, 1998. You should also read Changes in
Accounting Principles later in this note for more information.
Income Taxes
We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their
reported amounts in our financial statements. We reduce deferred tax assets by a
valuation allowance when, based upon our estimates, it is more likely than not
that we will not realize a portion of the deferred tax assets in a future
period. The estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax assets are
subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or circumstances.
We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries as our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in
our foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries are
approximately $410 million at December 31, 1999. It is not practicable to
determine the amount of U.S. income taxes that would be payable upon remittance
of the assets that represent those earnings.
Earnings Per Share
We compute basic earnings per share by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The
computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic
earnings per share, except that the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding is adjusted to include estimates of additional shares that would be
issued if potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. In addition,
income available to common shareholders is adjusted to include any changes in
income or loss that would result from the assumed issuance of the dilutive
common shares.
Allocation of Corporate Debt and Interest Expense
Our practice is to incur indebtedness for our consolidated group at the
parent company level or at a limited number of subsidiaries, rather than at the
operating company level, and to centrally manage various cash functions.
Consequently, our corporate debt has been allocated to discontinued operations
based upon the ratio of the discontinued operations' net assets to our
consolidated net assets plus debt. We have allocated interest expense, net of
tax, to our discontinued operations based on the same allocation methodology.
You should also read Note 2, Discontinued Operations and Extraordinary Loss,
for more information.
Research and Development
We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. Research
and development expenses were $32 million, $30 million, and $19 million for
1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively, and are included in the income statement
caption Engineering, research, and development expenses.
Foreign Currency Translation
Financial statements of international operations are translated into U.S.
dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and
liabilities and the weighted average exchange rate for each
51
58
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
applicable period for revenues, expenses, and gains and losses. Translation
adjustments are reflected in the balance sheet caption Accumulated other
comprehensive income loss.
Risk Management Activities
We use derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency
forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year, to hedge
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rate
swaps to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. Our primary exposure
to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made
between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties. Net
gains or losses on these foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated
as hedges are recognized in the income statement to offset the foreign currency
gain or loss on the underlying transaction. Additionally, we enter into foreign
currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes
in exchange rates on some intercompany and third party trade receivables and
payables. Since these anticipated transactions are not firm commitments, we mark
these forward contracts to market each period and record any gain or loss in the
income statement. From time to time we have also entered into forward contracts
to hedge our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. We recognize the after-tax
net gains or losses on these contracts on the accrual basis in the balance sheet
caption Accumulated other comprehensive income loss. In the statement of
cash flows, cash receipts or payments related to these exchange contracts are
classified consistent with the cash flows from the transaction being hedged.
We do not currently enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.
Changes in Accounting Principles
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, which establishes
new accounting and reporting standards for the costs of computer software
developed or obtained for internal use. This statement required prospective
application for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. We adopted SOP
98-1 on January 1, 1999. The impact of this new standard did not have a
significant effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In April 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of
Start-up Activities, which requires costs of start-up activities to be expensed
as incurred. This statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1998. The statement requires previously capitalized costs related
to start-up activities to be expensed as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle when the statement is adopted. Prior to January 1, 1999, we
capitalized certain costs related to start-up activities, primarily
pre-production design and development costs for new automobile original
equipment platforms. We adopted SOP 98-5 on January 1, 1999, and recorded an
after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle of $102 million net of a $50 million tax benefit, or $304 per
diluted common share. The change in accounting principle decreased income from
continuing operations by $19 million net of an $11 million tax benefit, or
$56 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 1999. If the new
accounting method had been applied retroactively, income from continuing
operations for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, would have been lower
by $19 million net of a $12 million tax benefit, or $57 per diluted common
share, and $18 million net of a $12 million tax benefit, or $54 per diluted
common share, respectively.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement establishes new
accounting and reporting standards requiring that all derivative instruments,
including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The
statement requires that changes in the
52
59
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
derivative fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges
allows a derivative gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged
item in the income statement and requires that a company must formally document,
designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge
accounting treatment. This statement cannot be applied retroactively and is
effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We are currently
evaluating the new standard and have not yet determined the impact it will have
on our financial position or results of operations.
Effective January 1, 1999, we changed our method of accounting for customer
acquisition costs from a deferral method to an expense-as-incurred method. In
connection with the decision to separate the automotive and specialty packaging
businesses into independent public companies, we determined that a change to an
expense-as-incurred method of accounting for automotive aftermarket customer
acquisition costs was preferable in order to permit improved comparability of
stand-alone financial results with our aftermarket industry competitors. We
recorded an after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of this change in
accounting principle of $32 million net of a $22 million tax benefit, or $95
per diluted common share. The change in accounting principle increased income
from continuing operations by $10 million net of $6 million in income tax
expense, or $30 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31,
1999. If the new accounting principle had been applied retroactively, income
from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, would
have been lower by $4 million net of a $3 million income tax benefit, or $11
per diluted common share, and $12 million net of a $8 million income tax
benefit, or $35 per diluted common share, respectively.
As required by the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 97-13,
Accounting for Costs Incurred in Connection with a Consulting Contract that
Combines Business Process Reengineering and Information Technology
Transformation, we recorded an after-tax charge of $46 million $135 per
diluted common share, net of a tax benefit of $28 million, in the fourth
quarter of 1997. EITF 97-13 establishes the accounting treatment and an
allocation methodology for certain consulting and other costs incurred in
connection with information technology transformation efforts. This charge was
reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Prior years' financial statements have been reclassified where appropriate
to conform to 1999 presentations.
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND EXTRAORDINARY LOSS
Background of the Spin-off Transaction
In July 1998, the Board of Directors authorized management to develop a
broad range of strategic alternatives to separate the automotive, paperboard
packaging, and specialty packaging businesses. Subsequently, we completed the
following actions   - In January 1999, we announced an agreement to contribute the
containerboard business to a new joint venture with an affiliate of
Madison Dearborn Partners. The proceeds from the transaction                    53
60
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
including debt assumed by the new joint venture, were approximately $2
billion. The transaction closed in April 1999. We retained a 43 percent
interest in the joint venture.
- In April 1999, we announced an agreement to sell our folding carton
operations to Caraustar Industries. This transaction closed in June 1999.
The folding carton operations and the containerboard business together
represented our paperboard packaging operating segment.
- On November 4, 1999, we completed the spin-off of the common stock of
Tenneco Packaging Inc., now known as Pactiv Corporation, to our
shareholders. Pactiv included all of the businesses that made up our
specialty packaging segment, as well as our remaining interest in the
containerboard joint venture and our administrative services operations.
As a result of this series of transactions, our former specialty and
paperboard packaging operating segments are presented as discontinued operations
in the accompanying financial statements.
The morning following the spin-off, we completed a reverse stock split that
had been approved by our shareholders in a special meeting held in October 1999.
As a result, every five shares of our common stock were converted into one share
of our new common stock.
Before the spin-off, we realigned substantially all of our existing debt
through a combination of tender offers, exchange offers, and other refinancings.
You should also read Note 4, Long-Term Debt, Short-Term Debt, and Financing
Arrangements for more information.
Discontinued Operations
Our loss from discontinued operations in 1999 was $208 million, comprised
principally of an after-tax loss on sale of the paperboard packaging business of
$207 million. This loss on sale includes a $54 million net loss in the fourth
quarter, reflecting events that occurred subsequent to the April 1999 sale
related to the final settlement of working capital amounts, revisions to
actuarially-determined estimates of pension plan effects, and changes in
estimates regarding liabilities retained by Pactiv.
The Specialty Packaging Business
Net assets as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and results of operations for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, for the specialty packaging
business were as follows                                1999   1998   1997

Extraordinary Loss
In connection with the sale of the containerboard assets, an extraordinary
loss of approximately $7 million, net of an income tax benefit of $3 million,
was recognized due to the early retirement of debt. As a result of the debt
realignment prior to the spin-off, we recognized an extraordinary loss of
approximately $11 million, net of an income tax benefit of $7 million. This
extraordinary loss consists principally of the fair value paid in the cash
tender offers in excess of the historical carrying value for the debt tendered.
3. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
We adopted plans to restructure portions of our operations in both 1998 and
1999. In the fourth quarter of 1998, our Board of Directors approved an
extensive restructuring plan designed to reduce administrative and operational
overhead costs. We recorded a pre-tax charge to income from continuing
operations of $53 million, $34 million after-tax, or $102 per diluted common
share. Of the pre-tax charge, for operational restructuring plans, $36 million
related to the consolidation of the manufacturing and distribution operations of
our North American aftermarket business. A staff and related cost reduction
plan, which covered employees in both the operating units and corporate
operations, cost $17 million.
Our aftermarket restructuring involved closing two plant locations and five
distribution centers, resulting in eliminating 302 positions. Our staff and
related cost reduction plan involved eliminating 454 administrative positions.
We wrote down the fixed assets at the locations to be closed to their fair
value, less costs to sell, in the fourth quarter of 1998. As a result of the
single-purpose nature of the assets, we estimated fair value at scrap value less
cost to dispose. We do not expect to receive any significant net cash proceeds
from the ultimate disposal of these assets, which should be complete by the
fourth quarter
55
62
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
of 2000. The effect of suspending depreciation for these impaired assets is a
reduction in depreciation and amortization of approximately $2 million on an
annual basis.
As of December 31, 1999, we have terminated approximately 670 employees and
our North American aftermarket business has closed one plant location and four
distribution centers under the 1998 plan. To address customer service and
production transfer issues, we have delayed closing one plant location and one
distribution center until the first quarter of 2000. We have executed all other
restructuring actions, with the exception of the final disposal of certain
assets, according to our initial plan, and those actions were completed by
year-end 1999.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, our Board of Directors approved a second
restructuring plan designed to further reduce operational overhead costs. We
recorded a pre-tax charge to income from continuing operations of $55 million 50 million after-tax, or $150 per diluted common share.
The charge includes $37 million recorded in Europe to close a ride control
manufacturing facility and an exhaust just-in-time plant, close or downsize four
aftermarket distribution centers, and reduce administrative overhead by reducing
management employment; $15 million to close a North American exhaust
manufacturing facility; and $3 million for employment reductions in South
America and Asia. In total, the plan involves eliminating approximately 780
positions. We wrote down the fixed assets at the locations to be closed to their
fair value, less costs to sell, in the fourth quarter of 1999. We estimated the
fair value for buildings using external real estate valuations or a review of
recent sales prices for like buildings in the area surrounding the plant to be
closed. As a result of the single-purpose nature of the machinery and equipment
to be disposed of, fair value was estimated at scrap value less cost to dispose
in most cases. For certain machines that have value in the used equipment
market, engineers estimated value based on recent sales of like machines. We
expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $11 million when we dispose
of these assets. The effect of suspending depreciation for these impaired assets
is a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $3
million on an annual basis. We expect to complete all restructuring activities
by the middle of 2001.
Amounts related to the restructuring plans are shown in the following

a We generally are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of
the total commitment and facility fees on the total commitment.
Prior to the spin-off, we realigned substantially all of our existing debt.
To accomplish this, we initiated an offer to exchange Pactiv debt securities for
some of our debt securities having a book value of $1,166 million. We also
initiated a cash tender offer to purchase debt securities having a book value of
$1,374 million and repaid substantially all of our short-term borrowings.
Finally, we retired approximately $400 million of subsidiary preferred stock.
These transactions were financed by borrowings under our new credit facility,
senior subordinated debt that we issued, and borrowings by Pactiv under new
credit facilities. The debt of Pactiv was rated investment grade and our debt
was rated non-investment grade by debt rating agencies.
As part of the debt realignment, on September 30, 1999, we entered into a
$155 billion committed senior secured financing arrangement with a syndicate of
banks and other financial institutions consisting of: i a $500 million,
six-year revolving credit facility; ii a $450 million six-year term loan;
iii a $300 million eight-year term loan and; iv a $300 million
eight-and-one-half-year term loan. We will pay a portion of each term loan in
quarterly installments beginning September 30, 2001. Borrowings under this
facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at our option, either i the
London Interbank Offering Rate plus a margin of 275 basis points for the
six-year revolving credit facility and the six-year term loan, 325 basis points
for the eight-year term loan and 350 basis points for the
eight-and-one-half-year term loan; or ii a rate consisting of the greater of
The Chase Manhattan Bank prime rate or the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis
points, plus a margin of 175 basis points for the six-year revolving credit
facility and the six-year term loan, 225 basis points for the eight-year term
loan and 250 basis points for the eight-and-one-half-year term loan. Under the
provisions of the senior credit facility agreement, the interest margins for
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the six-year term loan may be
adjusted based on the consolidated leverage ratio total debt divided by
consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
EBITDA as defined in the senior credit facility agreement measured at the
end of each quarter starting with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2000.

TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The senior credit facility agreement requires that we initially maintain:
i a consolidated leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness divided by
consolidated EBITDA not greater than 475; ii a consolidated interest
coverage ratio consolidated EBITDA divided by consolidated interest expense
not less than 200; and iii a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio
consolidated EBITDA less consolidated capital expenditures, divided by
consolidated interest expense not less than 100. Under the terms of the senior
credit facility agreement, the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio
will decrease beginning in the year 2001, the minimum permitted consolidated
interest coverage ratio will increase beginning in the year 2001, and the
minimum permitted consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio will increase
beginning in the year 2002. The senior credit facility agreement also contains
restrictions on our operations that are customary for similar facilities,
including limitations on: a incurring additional liens; b sale and leaseback
transactions; c liquidations and dissolutions; d incurring additional
indebtedness or guarantees; e capital expenditures; f dividends; g mergers
and consolidations; and h prepayments and modifications of subordinated and
other debt instruments. Compliance with these requirements and restrictions is a
condition for any incremental borrowings under the senior credit facility
agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the lenders to require
us to repay any outstanding loans.
On October 14, 1999, we issued $500 million of 11 5/8 percent senior
subordinated notes due in 2009. The senior subordinated debt indenture requires
that we, as a condition to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise
permitted, initially maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 200.
Under the terms of the indenture, the minimum interest coverage ratio will
increase beginning in 2001. The indenture also contains restrictions on our
operations, including limitations on: 1 incurring additional indebtedness or
liens; 2 dividends; 3 distributions and stock repurchases; 4 investments;
and 5 mergers and consolidations.

Under the terms of our senior credit facility agreement, we are required to
hedge our exposure to floating interest rates within 180 days following the date
of the spin-off so that at least 50 percent of our long-term debt is fixed for a
period of at least three years. In February 2000, we hedged $250 million of our
long-term, floating rate debt with three-year, floating to fixed interest rate
swaps. We must hedge approximately $50 million more of our long-term, floating
rate debt to satisfy the interest rate hedging requirement of the senior credit
facility agreement.

primarily with respect to letters of credit and other guarantees supporting
various financing and operating activities.
As of the spin-off, all of our then existing and future material domestic
wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guaranteed the senior
secured credit facility and the senior subordinated notes on a joint and several

respectively, that we did not recognize in the statements of income when they
were generated. These unrecognized tax benefits resulted primarily from foreign
tax loss carryforwards that are available to reduce future foreign tax
liabilities.
The $223 million of U.S. tax loss carryforwards that exist at December 31,
1999, expire in 2018. The $29 million of state tax loss carryforwards that exist
at December 31, 1999, will expire in varying amounts over the period from 2000
to 2012. Of the $165 million of foreign tax loss carryforwards that exist at
December 31, 1999, $145 million do not expire and the remainder expires in
varying amounts over the period from 2000 to 2009.
We have tax sharing agreements with our former affiliates that allocate tax
liabilities for prior periods.
7. COMMON STOCK
On October 25, 1999, our shareholders approved a reverse stock split
whereby every five shares of our common stock were converted into one share of
our new common stock on the day following the spin-off of Pactiv. In addition,
the stock options outstanding on the date of the spin-off were adjusted such
that employees received options only in the company for which they worked. The
number of shares subject to these options, as well as their exercise prices,
were adjusted so that the options immediately after the spin-off had equivalent
economic terms to the options immediately before the spin-off. Also, on the date
of the spin-off, all restricted stock and units and all performance shares then
outstanding were fully vested. All share prices and amounts, prior to November
5, 1999, in this note, with the exception of the earnings per share table, are
presented before the effect of the spin-off and reverse stock split. We have
authorized 350 million shares $01 par value of common stock, of which
34,970,485 shares and 173,670,197 shares were issued at December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. We held 1,298,373 shares and 6,757,678 shares of treasury
stock at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Stock Repurchase Plans
During 1997, we initiated a common stock repurchase program to acquire up
to 85 million shares. Approximately 75 million shares have been acquired under
this program at a total cost of approximately $289 million. All purchases that
we executed through this program were in the open market or negotiated
purchases.

The total number of shares of our common stock reserved at December 31,

Stock Plans
Tenneco Automotive Inc. Stock Ownership Plan -- In December 1996, we
adopted the 1996 Stock Ownership Plan, which permits the granting of a variety
of awards, including common stock, restricted stock, performance units, stock
appreciation rights SARs, and stock options to our directors, officers, and
employees. The plan, which will terminate December 31, 2001, was renamed the
Tenneco Automotive Inc. Stock Ownership Plan in connection with the spin-off.
We can issue up to 94 million shares of common stock under the Stock Ownership
Plan after adjusting for the spin-off and reverse stock split.
Restricted Stock/Units, Performance Units, and Stock Equivalent Units -- We
have granted restricted stock and restricted units under the Stock Ownership
Plan to certain key employees. These awards generally require, among other
things, that the employee remains our employee during the restriction period. We
have also granted performance units to certain key employees that will vest over
three years from the date of grant based on the attainment of specified
performance goals in each of the three years. During 1999, 1998, and 1997, we
granted 2,705,107, 640,810, and 494,350 shares and units, respectively, with a
weighted average fair value based on the price of our stock on the grant date of
$856, $3803, and $4308 per share, respectively. At December 31, 1999, 263,770
restricted shares at an average price of $840 per share, 465,000 performance
units at an average price of $856 per share, 39,076 restricted units at an
average price of $856 per unit, and 1,935,261 stock equivalent units at an
average price of $856 per unit were outstanding under this plan.
In December 1996, we adopted a restricted stock and unit plan and
performance unit plan for each member of the Board of Directors who is not also
an officer. During 1999, 6,000 performance units were issued under this plan at
the weighted average fair value of our stock on the grant date of $856 per
share. During 1998 and 1997, 1,700 and 5,040 restricted shares and units,
respectively, were issued under this plan at the weighted average fair value of
our stock on the grant date of $3731, and $4519 per share                    63

TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
respectively. At December 31, 1999, no restricted shares or restricted units and
6,000 performance units at an average price of $856 per unit were outstanding
under the plan.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan -- Effective April 1, 1997, we adopted an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP that allows U.S. and Canadian employees to
purchase our common stock at a 15% discount. Each year employees participating
in the ESPP may purchase shares with a discounted value not to exceed $21,250.
Under the ESPP, we sold 281,056, 613,195, and 244,768 shares to employees in
1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. The weighted average fair value of the
employee purchase right, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model and the assumptions described below except that the average life
of each purchase right was assumed to be 90 days, was $429, $631, and $1116
in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. The ESPP was suspended in June 1999, in
connection with the reorganization transactions.

We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, to account for our stock-based compensation plans. We
recognized after-tax stock-based compensation expense in 1999 of $11 million, in
1998 of $3 million, and in 1997 of $5 million, of which $8 million, $3 million,
and $4 million, respectively, related to restricted stock and performance shares
awarded to employees of our discontinued operations. Had compensation costs for
our stock-based compensation plans been determined in accordance with SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, based on the fair value at the
grant dates for the awards under those plans, our pro forma net income and
earnings per diluted share of common stock for the years ended December 31,
1999, 1998, and 1997, would have been lower by $13 million or $39 per diluted
common share, $33 million or $19 per diluted common share, and $34 million or
$20 per diluted common share, respectively of which $8 million, $20 million,
and $22 million related to employees of our discontinued operations,
respectively.
Grantor Trust
In August 1998, we established a grantor trust and issued approximately 19
million shares of common stock to the trust. This grantor trust was a so-called
rabbi trust designed to assure the payment of deferred compensation and
supplemental pension benefits. The trust was consolidated in our financial
statements and the shares were reflected in our financial statements as treasury
stock. Consequently, the shares of common stock issued to the trust were not
considered to be outstanding in the computation of earnings per share.
The grantor trust was terminated at the time of the spin-off.
Rights Plan
On September 9, 1998, we adopted a Rights Plan and established an
independent Board committee to review it every three years. The Rights Plan was
adopted to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent a potential acquiror
from gaining control of us in a transaction that is not in the best interests of
our shareholders. Generally, under the Rights Plan, as it has been amended, if a
person becomes the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of our outstanding
common stock, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right
exercise price, a number of shares of our common stock or, under certain
circumstances, of the acquiring person common stock, having a market value of
twice the right exercise price. Rights held by the 15 percent or more holder
will become void and will not be exercisable.
In March 2000, we amended the Rights Plan to i reduce from 20 percent to
15 percent the level of beneficial ownership at which the rights became
exercisable, as described above, and ii eliminate the qualified offer terms
of the plan. These terms provided that the rights would not become exercisable
in connection with a qualified offer, which was defined as an all-cash tender
offer for all outstanding common stock that was fully financed, remained open
for a period of at least 60 business days, resulted in

the offeror owning at least 85% of our common stock after consummation of the
offer, assured a prompt second-step acquisition of shares not purchased in the
initial offer, at the same price as the initial offer, and met certain other
requirements.
In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors
also adopted a three-year independent director evaluation TIDE mechanism.
Under the TIDE mechanism, an independent Board committee will review, on an
ongoing basis, the Rights Plan and developments in rights plans generally, and,
if it deems appropriate, recommend modification or termination of the Rights
Plan. The independent committee will report to our Board at least every three
years as to whether the Rights Plan continues to be in the best interests of our
shareholders.
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Tenneco Automotive Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan, holders of our common stock may apply their cash dividends and optional
cash investments to the purchase of additional shares of our common stock.

Subsequent to each sale, the investor had approximately a 25% interest in TIHC,

stock of TIHC. We and some of our subsidiaries held 100% of the issued and
outstanding $800 junior preferred stock and common stock of TIHC. For financial
reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, and earnings of TIHC and its
subsidiaries are consolidated in our financial statements, and the investor
preferred stock interest was recorded as Minority interest in the 1998 balance
sheet. In connection with the spin-off, we purchased the preferred stock from
the investor and the related minority interest was eliminated from our balance
sheet.
At December 31, 1998 there is $14 million of minority interest included as
part of the net assets of discontinued operations.
10. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all
of our employees. Benefits are based on years of service and, for most salaried
employees, on final average compensation. Our funding policy is to contribute to
the plans amounts necessary to satisfy the funding requirement of applicable
federal or foreign laws and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of
listed equity and fixed income securities. Some of our employees participated in
the Tenneco Retirement Plan TRP. For information regarding the TRP, see the
notes to the table below.
We have postretirement health care and life insurance plans that cover a
majority of our domestic employees. For salaried employees, the plans cover our
employees retiring on or after attaining age 55 who have had at least 10 years
of service with us after attaining age 45. For hourly employees, the
postretirement benefit plans generally cover employees who retire according to
one of our hourly employee retirement plans. All of these benefits may be
subject to deductibles, copayment provisions, and other limitations, and we have
reserved the right to change these benefits. Our postretirement benefit plans
are not funded.

Notes: Assets of one plan may not be utilized to pay benefits of other plans.
Additionally, the prepaid accrued benefit cost has been recorded based
upon certain actuarial estimates as described below. Those estimates are
subject to revision in future periods given new facts or circumstances.
Amounts included in the above table for 1998 reflect the participation of
our employees in the TRP; however, our employees will not accrue
additional benefits under the TRP following the spin-off. The sponsorship
and the prepaid pension costs related to the TRP were transferred to
Pactiv in connection with the corporate restructuring transactions. We
have established a new defined benefit plan for our employees called the
Tenneco Automotive Retirement Plan with provisions similar to the TRP.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair
value of plan assets for all pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations
in excess of plan assets were $50 million, $48 million, and $13 million,
respectively, as of September 30, 1999, and $114 million, $108 million, and $68
million, respectively, as of September 30, 1998. An additional expense of $1
million was recorded in 1999 related to our December adoption of the Tenneco
Automotive Retirement Plan.
The weighted average discount rates which are based on long-term market
rates used in determining the 1999, 1998, and 1997 actuarial present value of
the benefit obligations were 69%, 69%, and 76%, respectively. The rate of
increase in future compensation was 43%, 47%, and 50%, for 1999, 1998, and
1997, respectively. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets for 1999, 1998, and 1997 was 94%, 98%, and 99%, respectively.
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost from continuing operations for the
years 1999, 1998, and 1997 consist of the following components                                1999  1998  1997

The weighted average assumed health care cost trend rate used in
determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 5% for all
periods.
Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
in each year would increase the 1999, 1998, and 1997 accumulated postretirement
benefit obligations by approximately $13 million, $13 million, and $12 million,
respectively, and would increase the aggregate of the service cost

and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by
approximately $2 million each year for 1999, 1998, and 1997.
Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
in each year would decrease the 1999 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by approximately $11 million and would decrease the aggregate of
service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost by $2 million.
The discount rates which are based on long-term market rates used in
determining the 1999, 1998, and 1997 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations were 750%, 700%, and 775%, respectively.
11. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION
We are a global manufacturer with two geographic reportable segments: North
America and Europe. Each segment manufactures and distributes ride control and
emission control products primarily for the automotive industry. We have not
aggregrated individual operating segments within these reportable segments. The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as described in Note 1,
Summary of Accounting Policies. We evaluate segment performance based
primarily on income before interest expense, income taxes, and minority
interest. Products are transferred between segments and geographic areas on a
basis intended to reflect as nearly as possible the market value of the
products. Segment results for 1999, 1998, and 1997 are as follows                                          SEGMENT

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Capital Commitments
We estimate that expenditures aggregating approximately $81 million will be
required after December 31, 1999, to complete facilities and projects authorized
at such date, and we have made substantial commitments in connection with these
facilities and projects.
Lease Commitments
We have long-term leases for certain facilities, equipment, and other
assets. The minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with
lease terms in excess of one year are $16 million, $15 million, $12 million, $11
million, and $11 million for the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004,
respectively, and $25 million for subsequent years.
Our commitments under capital leases were not significant to the
accompanying financial statements. Total rental expense for continuing
operations for the years 1999, 1998, and 1997 was $34 million, $31 million, and
$30 million, respectively, including minimum rentals under non-cancelable
operating leases of $18 million, $16 million, and $29 million for the
corresponding periods.
Litigation
We are party to various legal proceedings arising from our operations. We
believe that the outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the
aggregate, will have no material effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

79
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and
regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We have provided reserves
for compliance with these laws and regulations where it is probable that a
liability exists and where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability.
The estimated liabilities recorded are subject to change as more information
becomes available regarding the magnitude of possible costs and the timing,
varying costs, and effectiveness of alternative technologies. However, we
believe that any additional costs that may arise as more information becomes
available will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results
of operations.
13. SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Basis of Presentation
We issued senior subordinated notes due 2009 as a component of a plan to
realign our debt prior to the spin-off. You should also read Note 2,
Discontinued Operations and Extraordinary Loss for further discussion of the
spin-off and debt realignment and Note 5, Financial Instruments for further
discussion of the notes and related guarantee. All of our existing and future
material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries the Guarantor Subsidiaries fully
and unconditionally guarantee the notes on a joint and several basis. We believe
separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning each of the
Guarantor Subsidiaries would not provide additional information that is material
to investors. Therefore, the Guarantor Subsidiaries are combined in the
presentation below.
Included in the financial information of the Guarantor Subsidiaries for
each period presented are the financial position and results of operations of a
domestic subsidiary, Tenneco International Holding Corp., which had issued
preferred stock to a third party See Note 9, Minority Interest.
These condensed consolidating financial statements are presented on the
equity method. Under this method, our investments are recorded at cost and
adjusted for our ownership share of a subsidiary cumulative results of
operations, capital contributions and distributions, and other equity changes.
The balance sheet caption Investment in affiliated companies includes
investments in continuing and discontinued subsidiaries. You should read the
condensed consolidating financial statements of the Guarantor Subsidiaries in
connection with our consolidated financial statements and related notes of which
this note is an integral part.
Distributions
There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Guarantor
Subsidiaries to make distributions to us.
