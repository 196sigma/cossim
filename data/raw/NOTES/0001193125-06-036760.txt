Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of Con Edison is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of the effectiveness of controls to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management of Con Edison assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, using the criteria
established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that Con Edison had effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005.  Managements assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Con Edisons independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the
following page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Kevin Burke President and Chief Executive Officer Robert N. Hoglund Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Consolidated Edison, Inc.:
We have completed integrated audits of Consolidated Edison, Inc.s 2005 and 2004
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Our opinions based on our audits, are presented below.  Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Report of Management on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item8, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements
assessment andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit
of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New York, New York February16, 2006

Notes to the Financial Statements  General
These combined notes accompany and form an integral part of the separate consolidated financial statements of each of the two separate registrants: Consolidated
Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries Con Edison and Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries Con Edison of New York. Con Edison of New York is a subsidiary of Con Edison and as such its financial condition and results of
operations and cash flows, which are presented separately in the Con Edison of New York consolidated financial statements, are also consolidated, along with those of Con Edisons other utility subsidiary, Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc.
OR, and Con Edisons competitive businesses discussed below in Con Edisons consolidated financial statements. The term Utilities is used in these notes to refer to Con Edison of New York and OR.  As used in these notes, the term Companies refers to Con Edison and Con Edison of New York
and, except as otherwise noted, the information in these combined notes relates to each of the Companies. However, Con Edison of New York makes no representation as to information relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than
itself.  Con Edison has two regulated utility subsidiaries: Con Edison of New York and
OR. Con Edison of New York provides electric service and gas service in New York City and Westchester County. The company also provides steam service in parts of Manhattan. OR, along with its regulated utility subsidiaries, provides
electric service in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania and gas service in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of eastern Pennsylvania. Con Edison has the following competitive energy
businesses: Consolidated Edison Solutions, Inc. Con Edison Solutions, a retail energy services company that sells electricity to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and OR, and also offers energy-related
services; Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. Con Edison Energy, a wholesale energy supply company; and Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. Con Edison Development, a company that owns and operates generating plants and participates in other
infrastructure projects.  In December 2004, after a comprehensive strategic review, Con
Edison determined to sell Con Edison Communications, LLC Con Edison Communications. See Note U.  Note A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The Companies consolidated financial statements include the accounts of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities see Note Q, as
required. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Accounting
Policies The accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For the
Utilities, these accounting principles include the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and, in
accordance with SFAS No71, the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.  SFAS No71 specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and
how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the
future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred
credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No71.  The
Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in Note B. The Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on all of their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made, and are paying or being charged
with a return on all of their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate
provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.  Other
significant accounting policies of the Companies are referenced below in this Note A and in the notes that follow.  Plant and Depreciation Utility Plant Utility plant is stated at original cost. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized. The capitalized cost of additions to
utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction AFDC. The original cost of property is charged to expense over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. Upon retirement, the original cost of property is charged to accumulated depreciation. See Note R.  Rates used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate of return on the regulated utilities own funds when so used, determined in accordance with
regulations of the FERC or the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The rate is compounded semiannually, and the 
75 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
amounts applicable to borrowed funds are treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the regulated utilities own funds are
credited to other income deductions. The AFDC rates for Con Edison of New York were 74 percent, 69 percent and 71 percent for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The AFDC rates for OR were 39 percent, 36 percent and 11 percent for 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.  The Utilities generally compute annual charges for
depreciation using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, with rates based on average service lives and net salvage factors. The average depreciation rates for Con Edison of New York were 29 percent for 2005 and 30 percent for
2004 and 2003. The average depreciation rates for OR were 29 percent for 2005 and 2004 and 31 percent for 2003, respectively.  The estimated lives for utility plant for Con Edison of New York range from 25 to 80 years for electric, 15 to 85 years for gas, 30 to 70 years for steam and 8 to 50 years for
general plant. For OR, the estimated lives for utility plant range from 5 to 65 years for electric, 7 to 75 years for gas and 5 to 55 years for general plant.  At December31, 2005 and 2004, the capitalized cost of the Companies utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, was as follows:

Primarily distribution.  Non-Utility Plant Non-utility plant is stated at original cost. For the Utilities, non-utility plant consists primarily of land and telecommunication
facilities that are currently not used within electric, gas or steam utility operations. For Con Edisons competitive businesses, non-utility plant consists primarily of electric generating facilities. Depreciation on these assets is computed
using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 70 years.  The average non-utility depreciation rates for Con Edison Development were 28 percent, 27 percent and 30 percent for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  In accordance with SFAS No34, Capitalization of Interest Costs, Con Edison
capitalizes interest on its borrowings associated with the competitive businesses capital projects in progress. Capitalized interest is added to the asset cost, and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The amount of such
capitalized interest cost for 2003 was $6 million. There was no capitalized interest cost in 2004 and 2005.  Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill
for impairment annually. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of
impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. See Note L.  Impairments In accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Companies evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets, based on projections of undiscounted future cash flows, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets
may not be recoverable. In the event an evaluation indicates that such cash flows cannot be expected to be sufficient to fully recover the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value. See Note U.  Revenues The
Utilities and Con Edison Solutions recognize revenues for electric, gas and steam service on a monthly billing cycle basis. The Utilities defer over a 12-month period net interruptible gas revenues, other than those authorized by the New York State
Public Service Commission PSC to be retained by the Utilities, for refund to firm gas sales and transportation customers. OR and Con Edison Solutions accrue revenues at the end of each month for estimated energy service not yet billed to
customers, while Con Edison of New York does not accrue such revenues, in accordance with current regulatory agreements. Con Edison of New York estimates its unbilled revenues at December31, 2005 and 2004 to be approximately $432 million and
$380 million, respectively. Unbilled revenues included in Con Edisons balance sheet at December31, 2005 and 2004 were $116 million and $73 million, respectively.  76 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
The PSC requires utilities to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis i.e., included in both revenue and
expense. The recovery of these taxes is included in the revenue requirement within each of the respective PSC approved rate plans.  Recoverable Energy Costs The Utilities generally recover all of their prudently incurred
fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility commissions. If the actual energy supply costs for a given month are more or less than the
amounts billed to customers for that month, the difference in most cases is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed electric and steam supply costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers
during the next billing cycle normally within one or two months. For the Utilities gas costs, differences between actual and billed gas costs during the 12-month period ending each August are charged or refunded to customers during a
subsequent 12-month period.  New York Independent System Operator NYISO
The Utilities purchase electricity through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. The difference between purchased power and related costs
initially billed to the Utilities by the NYISO and the actual cost of power subsequently calculated by the NYISO is refunded by the NYISO to the Utilities, or paid to the NYISO by the Utilities. The reconciliation payments or receipts are
recoverable from or refundable to the Utilities customers. At December31, 2005 and 2004, Con Edison of New York had deferred $20 million and $160 million, respectively, of funds received from the NYISO as a regulatory liability to be
applied for customer benefit.  Certain other payments to or receipts from the NYISO are
also subject to reconciliation, with shortfalls or amounts in excess of specified rate allowances recoverable from or refundable to customers. These include proceeds from the sale through the NYISO of transmission rights on Con Edison of New
Yorks transmission system Transmission Congestion Contracts or TCCs. For Con Edison of New York, TCC sales proceeds in excess of $60 million are deferred as a regulatory liability to be applied for customer benefit and do not affect net
income.  Sulfur Dioxide Allowances In accordance with the federal Clean Air Act, the Utilities have been allocated sulfur dioxide SO2 emission allowances which the Utilities may sell, trade or hold for future use. Generally, the Utilities defer their proceeds from the sale of SO2 allowances as regulatory liabilities to be applied for customer benefit. See Note B. For the competitive energy businesses, sales of SO2 allowances are reflected in earnings in the periods in which the sales occur. The proceeds received from the sale of S02 allowances are included in net cash flows from operating activities in the Companies Statements of Cash Flows.  Temporary Cash Investments Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly-liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. They are stated at cost, which approximates market. The Companies consider
temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.  Investments Investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edisons competitive businesses, which are recorded at cost or accounted for under the equity method depending on the
subsidiaries percentage ownership or accounted for as leveraged leases in accordance with SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases. See Note K for a discussion of investments in Lease In/Lease Out transactions.  Federal Income Tax In accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Companies have recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and
liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate agreements, the Utilities have recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or turn-around of these
temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with SFAS No71, the Utilities have established regulatory assets for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related future tax expense. See
Notes B and M. In 1993, the PSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No109 and providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates.  Accumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related
properties and applied as a reduction to future federal income tax expense.  Con Edison
and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate return method. Each member pays or receives an amount based on its own
taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements between the members of the consolidated group.  77 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
State Income Tax The New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies
were changed effective January 2000. Certain revenue-based taxes were repealed or reduced and replaced by a net income-based tax. In June 2001, the PSC authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes being
collected and the actual tax expense under the new tax law until that expense is incorporated in base rates. For Con Edison of New York, effective October 2004, state income tax is being recovered through base rates for its gas and steam businesses
and effective April 2005, for its electric business. For OR, state income tax is being recovered through base rates for its electric and gas businesses effective November 2003.  Con Edison and its subsidiaries file a combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax
return, the income of all entities in the combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the company does business. Each
member of the group pays or receives an amount based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.  Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Research and development
costs were as follows:  FortheYearsEndedDecember31 Millions of Dollars

Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.  Earnings Per Common Share In accordance with SFAS
No128, Earnings per Share, Con Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of its consolidated income statement. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareholders
Net income on Con Edisons consolidated income statement by the weighted average number of Con Edison common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are
increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock.  Potentially dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock, deferred common shares and stock options for which the average market
price of the common shares for the period was greater than the exercise price. See Note N.  Basic and diluted EPS for Con Edison are calculated as follows:  Millions of Dollars, except pershare amounts/Shares in Millions
For the Years EndedDecember31 2005 2004 2003 Income from continuing operations 732 549 634 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax 13 12 109 Income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 719 537 525 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, net of tax 3 Net income 719 537 528 Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic 2439 2358 2209 Add: Incremental shares attributable to effect of potentially dilutive securities 08 06 09 Adjusted weighted average common shares outstanding Diluted 2447 2364 2218 EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BASIC Continuing operations 300 233 287 Discontinued operations 005 005 050 Before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 295 228 237 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 002 Net income 295 228 239 EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE DILUTED Continuing operations 299 232 286 Discontinued operations 005 005 050 Before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 294 227 236 Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 002 Net income 294 227 238
The computation of diluted earnings per share
excludes 09million, 44million and 41million Con Edison common shares for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, because the average closing market price of the common shares during these periods
exceeds the exercise prices on the options.  Stock-Based Compensation 
Con Edison accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value model of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations. See Note N.  78 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if Con Edison had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure An Amendment of FASB Statement
No123, for the purposes of recognizing compensation expense on employee stock-based arrangements.  Con Edison

compensation plans allow employees to continue vesting in an award in accordance with the stated vesting terms even though the employee has retired from the company. In its pro forma disclosures, Con Edison has historically recognized compensation
cost over the employees nominal vesting period with any remaining compensation cost recognized at the date of retirement the nominal vesting period approach. The pro forma compensation cost would not have materially increased had the company
recognized compensation cost immediately for awards granted to retirement eligible employees and over the period from the grant date to the date of retirement eligibility, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period
non-substantive vesting period approach.  Con Edison plans to adopt the non-substantive
vesting period approach in connection with its implementation of SFAS 123 R, Share-Based Payment. See Note N.  Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Note B Regulatory Matters Rate and Restructuring Agreements Electric In September 1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement between Con Edison
of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties the 1997 Restructuring Agreement. The 1997 Restructuring Agreement provided for a transition to a competitive electric market through the development of a retail access plan, a rate plan for the
period ended March31, 2002, the divestiture of most of the companys electric generating capacity, and a reasonable opportunity for recovery of strandable costs costs that may not be recoverable in a competitive electric
supply market.  At December31, 2005, approximately 190,000 Con Edison of New York
customers representing approximately 31 percent of aggregate customer peak demand were purchasing electricity from other suppliers under the electric retail access program which is available to all of the companys electric customers. The
company delivers electricity to participating customers in this program through its regulated transmission and distribution systems. In general, its delivery rates for retail access customers are equal to the full-service rates applicable to other
comparable customers, less the cost of supplying customers with energy and capacity.  In
November 2000, the PSC approved an agreement the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement that revised and extended the rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the company reduced the
distribution component of its electric rates by $170 million on an annual basis, effective October 2000.  79 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
Under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, as approved by the PSC and as modified in December 2001, 35 percent of any earnings in each of the rate years ending March 2002
through 2005 above a specified rate of return on electric common equity were to be retained for shareholders and the balance was to be applied for customer benefit as determined by the PSC. There was no sharing of earnings for the rate years ended
March 2002 and 2005. In 2002 and 2003, Con Edison of New York established an electric shared earnings reserve totaling $49 million for the rate year ending March 2003. In 2004, an electric shared earnings reserve of less than $1 million for the rate
year ending March 2004 was established. In addition, the company recorded penalties relating to reliability standards tied to targets established in regulatory proceedings of $2 million, $8 million and $3 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement also continued the rate provisions
pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers its potential strandable costs and its purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A.  In March 2005, the PSC approved a Joint Proposal by Con Edison of New York, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates the
company can charge its customers for electric delivery service the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement. The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement covers the three-year period April 2005 through March 2008, and provides for increases in electric base rates of
$1046 million, effective April1, 2005, and $2204 million, effective April1, 2007. In addition, the company will retain the first $60 million of auction proceeds from the sale of transmission rights on the companys transmission
system transmission congestion contracts in each of the three years. The rate increases also include the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization will be to increase electric revenues by $128
million, $173 million and $249 million in the first, second and third rate years, respectively.  The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement provides for annual reconciliations of the differences between the actual amount of transmission and distribution utility plant, net of depreciation Net TD and the actual amount of certain operating
costs experienced over the term of the agreement, as compared in each case to the amounts reflected in electric rates.  If the actual Net TD is greater than the Net TD reflected in rates, the company will accrue a regulatory asset and increase its revenues by the revenue requirement impact
of such difference i.e., a return on investment, depreciation and income taxes. If the actual Net TD is less than the Net TD reflected in rates, the company will accrue a regulatory liability and decrease its revenues by the revenue
requirement impact of such difference. At December31, 2005, a regulatory asset of $38 million was deferred related to this reconciliation.  If the actual amount of pension or other postretirement benefit costs, environmental remediation costs and, if the variation exceeds 25 percent,
property taxes or the cost of moving facilities to avoid interfering with government projects is greater than the respective amount for each such cost reflected in rates, the company will accrue a regulatory asset for the difference and defer
recognition in income of the difference. If the actual amount is less than the amount reflected in electric rates, the company will accrue a regulatory liability for the difference and decrease its revenues by the amount of such difference. Any
regulatory asset resulting from these cost reconciliations is subject to offset, as described below, if the company earns, excluding the effect of the incentives and penalties discussed below Adjusted Earnings, between an 114 percent and a 13
percent return on equity based on the companys actual capitalization, subject to a maximum equity ratio of 50 percent. No regulatory asset is to be accrued if Adjusted Earnings exceed a 13 percent return on equity.  Under the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, any Adjusted Earnings between an 114 percent and a 13 percent
return on equity are to be used to offset 50 percent of any regulatory asset resulting from the cost reconciliation. The company can retain 50 percent of any remaining above-target Adjusted Earnings, with the balance being deferred for the benefit
of customers. If Adjusted Earnings exceed a 13 percent return, the company can retain 25 percent of the above-target Adjusted Earnings, with the balance being deferred for the benefit of customers.  The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement also provided for the continuation of the rate provisions pursuant to
which the company recovers its potential strandable costs and its purchased power and fuel costs from customers.  The 2005 Electric Rate Agreement included potential positive earnings adjustments incentives if the company meets certain standards for its retail access and demand side
management programs, and potential negative earnings adjustments penalties, which could be substantial, if it does not meet certain standards for ifrequency and duration of service interruptions; iimajor outages; iiirepair,
removal or replacement of damaged poles, temporary shunts, street lights, traffic signals and circuit breakers; and ivcustomer service. In 2005, an $8 million penalty for not meeting certain standards for duration of service interruptions
was recorded.  In accordance with the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, the company
recognized a $100 million pre-tax charge in 2004 to 
80 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to prior period pension credits.  In accordance with the 2005 Electric Rate Agreement, at December31, 2005, Con Edison of New York estimated that its Adjusted Earnings above 114
percent for the rate year ending March31, 2006 would exceed the target sharing level by $59 million, of which $47 million was applied to reduce regulatory assets arising from the cost reconciliations, and $6 million was reserved for customer
benefit.  In 1997, the PSC approved a four-year OR restructuring plan pursuant to
which OR sold all of its generating assets and made retail access available to all of its electric customers effective May 1999. In 1998 and 1999, similar plans for ORs utility subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey were
approved by state regulators.  In October 2003, the PSC approved agreements among
OR, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates OR can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The electric agreement, which covers the period from July 2003 through October 2006, provides for no changes
to electric base rates and contains provisions for the amortization and offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will reduce electric operating income by a total of $11 million pre tax over the period covered by the
agreement. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis. It also provides for OR to share equally with customers earnings above a 1275 percent return on common equity during the three-year
period from July 2003 through June 2006. Beginning July 2006, OR will not be subject to earnings sharing.  In July 2003, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities NJBPU ruled on the petitions of Rockland Electric Company RECO for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred purchased power costs. The NJBPU ordered a $7
million decrease in RECOs electric base rates, effective August 2003, authorized RECOs recovery of approximately $83 million of previously deferred purchased power costs and associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately
$19 million of such costs and associated interest. At December31, 2002, the company had accrued a reserve for $13 million of the disallowance, and at June30, 2003 reserved an additional $6 million for the disallowance.  In July 2004, the NJBPU approved RECOs Phase II petition to increase base rates annually by $27
million 20% increase, effective August1, 2004. The Phase II decision provides for the recovery of carrying costs for two substation projects and specified additional reliability programs. Also in July 2004, a special purpose entity formed by RECO which is included in the consolidated financial statements of Con Edison issued $46 million of 522% Transition Bonds and used the proceeds thereof to purchase from RECO the right to be paid a
Transition Bond Charge TBC and associated tax charges by its customers relating to the balance of previously deferred purchased power costs, discussed above. The TBC replaced a Transition Recovery Charge, a temporary surcharge that was effective
August1, 2003.  Pike County Light Power Company Pike is obligated
under Pennsylvania law to serve those customers who do not purchase electricity from other suppliers. In January 2006, Pike began charging new rates to these customers that reflected prices resulting from a competitive auction, overseen and approved
by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PPUC. As a result, customers bills increased substantially. Subsequently, the PPUC initiated a fact-finding investigation into the competitive electric market in Pikes service territory.
Gas In April 2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three-year period ending September30, 2004. The rate agreement reduced gas rates by $25 million annually.  In September 2004, the PSC approved a Joint Proposal by Con Edison of New York, the staff of the PSC
and other parties with respect to the rates the company can charge its customers for gas and steam services. The approved gas rate plan covers the three-year period October 2004 through September 2007, and provided for an increase in gas base rates
of $468 million, effective October1, 2004, with deferral accounting to be used to allocate the income statement effect of the increase over the term of the agreement. The rate increase is net of a $175 million pre-tax charge to gas operating
revenues, which the company recognized in 2004, to resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits. In addition to this rate increase, the company will retain the first $35 million
of net revenues from non-firm customer transactions in each year of the plan. The rate increases also include the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization will be to increase gas revenues by $41
million over the period of the three-year rate plan.  Additional provisions of the gas
rate plan include: equal sharing with customers of earnings above an 1175 percent return on common equity based upon the actual average common equity ratio, subject to a maximum common equity ratio of 50 percent of capitalization; reconciliation
of pension and other post-employment benefit costs allocable to the gas business to the 
81 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
amounts for such costs reflected in rates, with the difference deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, for future recovery from or refund to
customers; opportunities to retain for shareholders a percentage of annual gas net revenues from non-firm customer transactions 20 percent of revenues between $35 million and $50 million, 25 percent between $50 million and $70 million and 10
percent over $70 million, and to earn an incentive of up to $85 million over the period of the rate plan depending upon the number of customers that migrate to retail access; continuation of provisions for the recovery from customers on a current
basis of the cost of purchased gas and for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses; continuation of provisions pursuant to which the effects of weather on gas income are moderated; and continuation of the deferral as a regulatory asset or
liability, subject to certain limitations, of differences between actual costs and amounts reflected in rates for property taxes and interference costs.  In October 2003, the PSC approved a new gas rate agreement among OR, the PSC staff and other parties. This agreement, which covers the period November 2003 through October
2006, provides for increases in gas base rates of $9 million 58 percent effective November 2003, $9 million 48 percent effective November 2004 and $5 million 25 percent effective November 2005. The agreement provides for OR to share
equally with customers earnings in excess of an 11 percent return on common equity. It continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and continues a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not
eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. The rate increases also include the amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization will be to increase gas revenues by $2 million over
the period of the three-year rate plan.  In May 2005, the PPUC approved an increase to
the rates Pike charges for gas service by $01 million 87%, effective June1, 2005.  In November 2005, OR filed a request with the PSC for an increase in the rates it charges for gas service, effective November1, 2006, of $24 million 47%. The filing reflects a return on common equity of 11 percent and a common
equity ratio of 489 percent of capitalization. The filing includes a proposal for a three-year plan, with additional increases effective November1, 2007 and 2008 of $21 million and $18 million, respectively. The filing proposes continuation
of the current gas rate plan provisions with respect to the reconciliation of actual expenses allocable to gas to the amounts reflected in rates for pension and other postemployment benefit costs, property taxes, interference, environmental
remediation and research and development costs.  Steam In November 2000, the PSC authorized implementation of an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties, that provided for a $17 million steam
rate increase in October 2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October 2004. The agreement continued the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovered purchased steam and fuel costs on a
current basis.  In September 2004, the PSC approved a steam rate plan covering the
two-year period October 2004 through September 2006. The plan provides for increases in steam base rates of $496 million, effective October1, 2004, and $274 million, effective October1, 2005. The increases are net of a $62 million
pre-tax charge to steam operating revenues, which the company recognized in 2004 to resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits. The rate increases also include the
amortization of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. The net effect of this amortization will be to decrease steam revenues by $3 million over the period of the two-year rate plan.  Additional provisions of the steam rate plan include: equal sharing with customers of earnings in excess of an 1175 percent return on common equity
based upon the actual average common equity ratio, subject to a maximum common equity ratio of 50 percent of capitalization; reconciliation of pension and other post-employment benefit costs allocable to the steam business to the amounts for such
costs reflected in rates, with the difference deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, for future recovery from or refund to customers; continuation of provisions for the recovery from customers on a current basis of the cost
of fuel and purchased steam and for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses; and continuation of the deferral as a regulatory asset or liability, subject to certain limitations, of differences between actual costs and amounts reflected in
rates for property taxes and interference costs.  In April 2005, Con Edison of New York
commenced commercial operation of the East River Repowering Project ERRP and retired its Waterside generating station. Under the steam rate plan, the company credited customers with the estimated net monthly fuel savings from the ERRP until the
plant was in service. The company will recover all benefits credited to customers during the period January 2005 through March 2005 over the subsequent 18 months.  In November 2005, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC for a net increase in the rates it charges for steam service, effective
October1, 2006, of $68 million 96 percent. 
82 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
The filing reflects a return on common equity of 11 percent and a common equity ratio of 49 percent. The filing includes a proposal for a three-year rate plan, with
additional increases effective October1, 2007 and 2008 of $15 million and $12 million, respectively. The filing proposes continuation of the current steam rate plan provisions with respect to recovery from customers of the cost of fuel and
purchased steam, environmental remediation expenses and the reconciliation of actual expenses allocable to steam to the amounts reflected in rates for pension and other post-employment benefit costs, property taxes and interference costs.
In December 2005, the PSC issued an order regarding a steam business development plan
developed by a task force on which Con Edison of New York, governmental, consumer, environmental and steam producer representatives participated. The PSC characterized negatively the companys steam business
development efforts and ordered the company to implement certain of the plans recommendations, including developing account management and geographic information systems, and preparing steam resource and targeted marketing plans, strengthening
relationships with customers advisors and vendors of steam equipment and promoting hybrid chiller systems which would use steam for cooling purposes during periods of high electric demand. Certain of the recommendations were reflected in the
companys pending steam rate request and others may also be considered in connection with the request.  83 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued

Net electric deferrals represents the remaining unamortized balance of certain regulatory assets and liabilities of Con Edison of New York that were
combined effective April1, 2005 and are being amortized to income over the period April 2005 through March 2008, in accordance with the electric rate plan discussed above.  The $81 million prior year deferred tax amortization represents the revenue equivalent of $48 million for the amortization of deferred
taxes in the years 2000 to 2004 that was not recorded during that period. The correction was recognized in 2005 with this balance deferred as a regulatory liability pending disposition by the PSC.  Other Regulatory Matters In May 2005, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of certain properties located on First Avenue in Manhattan. Net proceeds from the sale received at closing totaled $534 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain on the sale of
$256 million. In accordance with the PSC order approving the sale of the properties, the company has deferred the net gain for the benefit of customers. The net after-tax gain on the sale, including additional expenses to be incurred, is estimated
at $114 million. There may be additional proceeds in the event of certain zoning changes or other developments.  Note C Capitalization Common Stock At December31, 2005 and 2004, Con Edison owned all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Utilities. Con Edison of New York owns 21,976,200 shares of Con
Edison stock, which it purchased prior to 2001 in connection with Con Edisons stock repurchase plan. Con Edison of New York presents in the financial statements the cost of the Con Edison stock it owns as a reduction of common
shareholders equity.  Capitalization of Con Edison The outstanding capitalization for each of the Companies is shown on its Consolidated Statement of Capitalization, and for Con Edison includes the Utilities outstanding
preferred stock and debt.  Preferred Stock of Con Edison of New York 
As of December31, 2005, 1,915,319 shares of Con Edison of New Yorks $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock the $5 Preferred and 375,626 shares of its Cumulative
Preferred Stock $100 par value were outstanding.  Dividends on the $5 Preferred Stock
are $5 per share per annum, payable quarterly, and dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock are $465 per share per annum, payable quarterly. The preferred dividends must be declared by Con Edison of New

respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of shareholders of Con Edison of New York, Con Edison which owns all of the 235,488,094 shares of Con Edison of New Yorks common stock that are outstanding and the holders of the $5
Preferred are each entitled to one vote for each share held. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock have no right to vote; provided, however, that if the $5 Preferred is no longer outstanding, the holders of
the Cumulative Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote for each share with respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of the shareholders of Con Edison of New York. In addition, if dividends are in arrears for certain periods, the
holders are entitled to certain rights with respect to the election of Con Edison of New Yorks Trustees. Without the consent of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, Con Edison of New York may not create or authorize any kind of stock
ranking prior to the Cumulative Preferred Stock or, if such actions would affect the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock adversely, be a party to any consolidation or merger, create or amend the terms of the Cumulative Preferred Stock or
reclassify the Cumulative Preferred Stock. Con Edison of New York may redeem the $5 Preferred at a redemption price of $105 per share and the Cumulative Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $101 per share in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
dividends. In the event of the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of Con Edison of New York, before any distribution of capital assets could be made to the holders of the companys common stock, the holders of the $5
Preferred and the Cumulative Preferred Stock would each be entitled to receive $100 per share, in the case of an involuntary liquidation, or an amount equal to the redemption price per share, in the case of a voluntary liquidation, in each case
together with all accrued and unpaid dividends.  Dividends In accordance with PSC requirements, the dividends that the Utilities generally pay are limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends
calculated on a two-year rolling average basis. Excluded from the calculation of income available for dividends are non-cash charges to income resulting from accounting changes or charges to income resulting from significant
unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to dividends paid in order to transfer to Con Edison proceeds from major transactions, such as asset sales, or to dividends reducing each utility subsidiarys equity ratio to a level
appropriate to its business risk.  In addition, no dividends may be paid, or funds set
apart for payment, on Con Edison of New Yorks common stock until all dividends accrued on the $5 Preferred Stock and Cumulative

The Utilities have issued certain series of
tax-exempt debt through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority NYSERDA that currently bear interest at a rate determined weekly and, in certain circumstances, is subject to mandatory tender for purchase by the Utilities.
Long-term debt is stated at cost, which in total, as of December31, 2005,
approximates fair value estimated based on current rates for debt of the same remaining maturities, except for $225 million of Con Edison of New Yorks tax-exempt financing. See Interest Rate Hedging in Note P.  At December31, 2005 and 2004, long-term debt of Con Edison included $23 million of mortgage bonds
collateralized by substantially all the utility plant and other physical property of ORs New Jersey and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries and for 2004, $46 million of Transition Bonds issued by ORs New Jersey utility subsidiary
through a special purpose entity. See Note B. At December31, 2005 and 2004, long-term debt of Con Edison included: $115 million and $128 million, respectively, of non-recourse debt of a Con Edison Development subsidiary collateralized by a
pledge of the Lakewood power plant, a related power purchase agreement and project assets; and $333 million and $336 million, respectively, of debt secured by the Newington power plant and related assets. See Note Q. At December31, 2005 and
2004, restricted cash relating to the operations of the Lakewood plant was $11 million and $16 million, respectively.  Significant Debt Covenants There are no significant debt covenants under the financing
arrangements for the debentures of Con Edison or Con Edison of New York, other than obligations to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met, and
no cross default provisions. The tax-exempt financing arrangements of the Utilities are subject to these covenants and the covenants discussed below. The Companies believe that they were in compliance with their significant debt covenants at
December31, 2005.  The tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of
uncollateralized promissory notes of the Utilities to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA. The tax-exempt financing arrangements include
covenants with respect to the tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The failure to comply with these covenants would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default
with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. The arrangements include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of
default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. If an event of default were to occur, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default applied might and, in certain circumstances would, become due and
payable immediately.  The liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the
tax-exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of the obligated utility will not at any time exceed 065 to 1 and that, subject to certain exceptions, the utility will not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber
its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default, defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of specified levels $100 million for Con Edison of New York.  Note D Short Term Borrowing In April 2005, Con Edison and the Utilities entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement, under which banks committed to provide loans and letters of credit in an aggregate
amount of up to $9375 million, and terminated a three-year credit agreement that was to expire in November 2005. Bank commitments under the new revolving credit agreement and an existing three-year credit agreement that expires in November 2006
total $15 billion, with the full amount available to Con Edison of New York and $500 million available to Con Edison, the parent company. Neither Con Edison nor either of the Utilities is responsible for the obligations under the credit agreements
of any company other than itself. The credit agreements support the Companies commercial paper program.  At December31, 2005, Con Edison had $755 million of commercial paper outstanding of which $520 million was outstanding under Con Edison of New Yorks program, at a weighted average interest rate of 43 percent. At
December31, 2004, Con Edison had $156 million of commercial paper outstanding of which $100 million was outstanding under Con Edison of New Yorks program, at a weighted average interest rate of 22 percent. 
86 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
The banks commitments under the credit agreements are subject to certain conditions, including that there be no event of default. The commitments are not subject
to maintenance of credit rating levels or the absence of a material adverse change. Upon a change of control of, or upon an event of default by one of the Companies, the banks may terminate their commitments with respect to that company and declare
any amounts owed by that company under the credit agreements immediately due and payable. Events of default include the exceeding at any time of a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capital of 065 to 1 at December31, 2005, this
ratio was 052 to 1 for Con Edison and 050 to 1 for Con Edison of New York; having liens on its assets in an aggregate amount exceeding 5 percent of its consolidated total capital, subject to certain exceptions; and the failure by the company,
following any applicable notice period, to meet certain other customary covenants. The fees charged for the revolving credit facilities and any loans made or letters of credit issued under the credit agreements reflect the Companies respective
credit ratings. At December31, 2005, $13 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the agreements.  See Note S for information about short-term borrowing between related parties.  Note E Pension Benefits Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified,
non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees of Con Edison of New York and OR and certain employees of Con Edisons competitive businesses. The plan is designed to comply with the
Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In addition, Con Edison maintains additional non-qualified supplemental pension plans.  Investment gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense
over a 10-year period. This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which provides a corridor method for
moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both
gains and losses.  Effective April1, 2005, in accordance with the 2005 Electric
Rate Agreement and October1, 2004, in accordance with the gas and steam Joint Proposal, Con Edison of New York began deferring the difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No87 and the rate allowance. Generally, OR has
also been deferring such difference pursuant to its rate agreements. See Note B.  Con
Edison uses a measurement date of December31 for its pension plan.  Net Periodic
Benefit Cost The components of the Companies net periodic benefit costs for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:  Con Edison Con Edison of New York Millions of Dollars

400 400 430  OR
400 400 415%
The expected return assumption reflects
anticipated returns on the plans current and future assets. The Companies use historical investment data as well as the plans target asset class and investment management mix to determine the expected return on plan assets. This analysis
incorporates such factors as real return, inflation, and expected investment manager performance for each broad asset class applicable to the plan. Historical plan performance and peer data are also reviewed to check for reasonability and
appropriateness.  Discount Rate Assumption To determine the assumed discount rate, the Companies use a model that produces a yield curve based on yields on selected highly rated Aaa or Aa, by Moodys Investors
Service corporate bonds. Bonds with insufficient liquidity, bonds with questionable pricing information and bonds that are not representative of the overall market are excluded from consideration. For example, the bonds used in the model cannot be
callable, they must have a price between 50 and 200, the yield must lie between 1 percent and 20 percent, and the amount of the issue must be in excess of $100 million. The spot rates defined by the yield curve and the plans projected benefit
payments are used to develop a weighted average discount rate.  Expected Benefit
Payments Based on current assumptions, the Companies expect to make the following benefit payments over the next ten years:  Millions ofdollars

Expected Contributions Based on current estimates, the Companies are not required under funding regulations and laws to make any contributions to the pension plan during 2006. The Companies policy
is to fund their accounting cost to the extent tax deductible, therefore, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York expect to make discretionary contributions of $70 million and $34 million, respectively, to the pension plan during 2006.  Plan Assets The asset allocations for the pension plan at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the target allocation for 2006 are as follows:  TargetAllocation

Con Edison has established a pension trust for
the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing retirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.  Pursuant to resolutions adopted by Con Edisons Board of Directors, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee has general
oversight responsibility for Con Edisons pension and other employee benefit plans. The pension plans Named Fiduciaries have been granted the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plans, including overall
responsibility for the investment of assets in the trust and the power to appoint and terminate investment managers. The 
89 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
Named Fiduciaries consist of Con Edisons chief executive, financial and accounting officers and others the Board of Trustees may appoint in addition to or in
place of the designated Named Fiduciaries.  The investment objective for the pension
trust is to maximize the long-term total return on the trust assets within a prudent level of risk. The investment strategy is to diversify its funds across asset classes, investment styles and fund managers. The target asset allocation is reviewed
periodically based on asset/liability studies and may be modified as appropriate. The target asset allocation for 2006 reflects the results of such a study conducted in 2003.  Individual fund managers operate under written guidelines provided by Con Edison, which cover such areas as investment objectives, performance
measurement, permissible investments, investment restrictions, trading and execution, and communication and reporting requirements. Manager performance, total fund performance, and compliance with asset allocation guidelines are monitored on an
ongoing basis, and reviewed by the Named Fiduciaries and reported to the Committee on a regular basis. Changes in fund managers and rebalancing of the portfolio are undertaken as appropriate. The Named Fiduciaries approve such changes, which are
also reported to the Committee.  The Companies also offer a defined contribution savings
plan that covers substantially all employees and made contributions to the plan as follows:  FortheYearsEndedDecember31 Millions of Dollars

Postretirement Benefits The Utilities currently have contributory comprehensive hospital, medical and prescription drug programs for all retirees, their
dependents and surviving spouses.  Con Edison of New York also has a contributory life
insurance program for bargaining unit employees and provides basic life insurance benefits up to a specified maximum at no cost to retired management employees. OR has a non-contributory life insurance program for retirees. Certain employees of
Con Edisons competitive businesses are eligible to receive benefits under these programs.  Investment plan gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period for the Companies. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period.  The Utilities generally defer any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No106,
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and the current rate allowances for their electric, gas and steam operations.  Con Edison uses a measurement date of December31 for its other postretirement benefit plans.

Con Edison has established postretirement health
and life insurance benefit plan trusts for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing other postretirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.  Refer to Note E for a discussion of Con Edisons investment policy for its benefit plans.  Effect of Medicare Prescription Benefit In December 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. FASB Staff Position FSP No. FAS 106-2, issued by the
FASB in May 2004, provides accounting and disclosure requirements relating to the Act. The Companies actuaries have determined that each prescription drug plan provides a benefit that is at least actuarially
equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug plan and projections indicate that this will be the case for 20 years; therefore, the Companies are eligible to receive the benefit that the Act makes available. When the plans benefits are no
longer actuarially equivalent to the Medicare plan, 25% of the retirees in each plan are assumed to begin to decline participation in the Companies prescription programs.  To reflect the effect of the Act on the plans, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were reduced for Con Edison and Con Edison of New
York by $206 million and $178 million, respectively, as of December31, 2005. The 2005 postretirement benefit costs were reduced by $28 million for Con Edison and $24 million for Con Edison of New York. The Companies will recognize the 28
percent benefit reflected as an unrecognized net gain to each plan as an offset to plan costs. The 28 percent benefit is expected to reduce prescription drug plan costs by about 25 percent starting in 2006.  Note G Environmental Matters Superfund Sites Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs
and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Utilities and their predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured
or stored.  The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act of 1980 and similar state statutes Superfund impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation and 
92 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
remediation costs which includes costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring and environmental damages. Liability under
these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws,
including their manufactured gas plant sites, are referred to herein as Superfund Sites.  For Superfund Sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the amount the Utilities will
need to pay to discharge their related obligations. For Superfund Sites including the manufactured gas plant sites for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the
undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate the sites. Remediation costs are estimated in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards and
experience with similar sites.  The accrued liabilities and regulatory assets related to
Superfund Sites at December31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:  ConEdison

Most of the accrued Superfund Site liability
relates to sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. As investigations progress on these and other sites, the Utilities expect that additional liability will be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be
material. Under their current rate agreements, the Utilities are permitted to recover or defer as regulatory assets for subsequent recovery through rates certain site investigation and remediation costs.  Environmental remediation costs incurred and insurance recoveries received related to Superfund Sites
at December31, 2005 and 2004, were as follows:  ConEdison ConEdisonofNewYork Millions of Dollars
2005 2004 2005 2004 Remediation costs incurred 46 47 41 44 Insurance recoveries received 2 36 2 36  Reduced amount deferred for recovery from customers. 35 million reduced amount deferred for recovery from customers and $1 million reduced related expenses.  In 2002, Con Edison of New York estimated that for its manufactured gas plant sites, most of which had not been investigated, its aggregate
undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and remediation of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants could range from approximately $65 million to $11 billion. In 2004, OR estimated that for
its manufactured gas plant sites, each of which has been investigated, the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the remediation of such contaminants could range from approximately $31 million to $87 million. These estimates were based on
the assumption that there is contamination at each of the sites and additional assumptions regarding the extent of contamination and the type and extent of remediation that may be required. Actual experience may be materially different. 
Asbestos Proceedings Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and
injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, which are many, have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate,
material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars; however, the Utilities believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, based on the disposition of previous claims. In 2004, Con Edison of
New York estimated that its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for these suits and additional suits that may be brought over the next 15 years is $25 million. The estimate was based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis
and risk factor assessment. Actual experience may be materially different.  In addition,
certain current and former employees have claimed or are claiming workers compensation benefits based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. Under its current rate agreements, Con Edison of New York is permitted to defer as
regulatory assets for subsequent recovery through rates liabilities incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and workers compensation claims.  93 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued

Note H Northeast
Utilities Litigation In March 2001, Con Edison commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York the District
Court, entitled Consolidated Edison, Inc. v. Northeast Utilities the First Federal Proceeding, seeking a declaratory judgment that Northeast Utilities has failed to meet certain conditions precedent to Con Edisons obligation to complete its
acquisition of Northeast Utilities pursuant to their agreement and plan of merger, dated as of October13, 1999, as amended and restated as of January11, 2000 the merger agreement. In May 2001, Con Edison amended its complaint. As
amended, Con Edisons complaint seeks, among other things, recovery of damages sustained by it as a result of the material breach of the merger agreement by Northeast Utilities, and the District Courts declaration that under the merger
agreement Con Edison has no further or continuing obligations to Northeast Utilities and Northeast Utilities has no further or continuing rights against Con Edison.  In June 2001, Northeast Utilities withdrew the separate action it commenced in March 2001 in the same court and filed as a counter-claim in the First
Federal Proceeding its claim that Con Edison materially breached the merger agreement and that, as a result, Northeast Utilities and its shareholders have suffered substantial damages, including the difference between the consideration to be paid to
Northeast Utilities shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement and the market value of Northeast Utilities common stock the so-called lost premium claim, expenditures in connection with regulatory approvals and lost
business opportunities. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Con Edison agreed to acquire Northeast Utilities for $2600 per share an estimated aggregate of not more than $39 billion plus $00034 per share for each day after August5, 2000
through the day prior to the completion of the transaction, payable 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in stock.  In March 2003, the District Court ruled on certain motions filed by Con Edison and Northeast Utilities in the First Federal Proceeding. The District Court ruled that Con
Edisons claim against Northeast Utilities for hundreds of millions of dollars for breach of the merger agreement, as well as Con Edisons claim that Northeast Utilities underwent a material adverse change, will go to trial. The District
Court also dismissed Con Edisons fraud and misrepresentation claims. In addition, the District Court ruled that Northeast Utilities shareholders were intended third-party beneficiaries of the merger agreement and the alleged $12 billion
lost premium claim against Con Edison would go to trial.  In May 2003, a lawsuit by a
purported class of Northeast Utilities shareholders, entitled Rimkoski, et al. v. Consolidated Edison, Inc., was filed in New York County Supreme Court the State Proceeding alleging breach of the merger agreement. The complaint defined the
putative class as holders of Northeast Utilities common stock on March5, 2001, and alleged that the class members were intended third party beneficiaries of the merger agreement. The complaint sought damages believed to be substantially
duplicative of those sought by Northeast Utilities on behalf of its shareholders in the First Federal Proceeding. In December 2003, the District Court granted Rimkoskis motion to intervene in the First Federal Proceeding and, in February 2004,
the State Proceeding was dismissed without prejudice. In January 2004, Rimkoski filed a motion in the First Federal Proceeding to certify his action as a class action on behalf of all holders of Northeast Utilities common stock on
March5, 2001 and to appoint Rimkoski as class representative. The motion is pending.  In May 2004, the District Court ruled that the Northeast Utilities shareholders who may pursue the lost premium claim against Con Edison are the holders of Northeast Utilities common stock on March5, 2001 and the District
Court therefore dismissed Northeast Utilities lost premium claim. The District Court certified its ruling regarding the lost premium claim for interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit the Court of
Appeals, and in June 2004 Northeast Utilities filed its motion for leave to appeal the issue to the Court of Appeals. The District Court further certified for interlocutory appeal its March 2003 determination that Northeast Utilities
shareholders are intended third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement, and in June 2004 Con Edison filed its motion for leave to appeal the issue to the Court of Appeals. In October 2004, the Court of Appeals granted both Con Edisons
motion and Northeast Utilities motion. In October 2005, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts March 2003 ruling that Northeast Utilities shareholders were intended third-party beneficiaries of the merger agreement, and
held that Northeast Utilities shareholders therefore could not sue Con Edison for the claimed lost premium. Also, in October 2005, Northeast Utilities 
94 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
and Rimkowski each filed petitions for rehearing of that Court of Appeals decision. In January 2006, the petitions for rehearing were denied.  In May 2004, the District Court dismissed the lawsuit that was commenced in October 2003 by a purported
class of Northeast Utilities shareholders, entitled Siegel et al. v. Consolidated Edison, Inc. the Second Federal Proceeding. The Second Federal Proceeding had sought unspecified injunctive relief and damages believed to be substantially
duplicative of the damages sought from Con Edison in the First Federal Proceeding. A motion by the plaintiffs in the Second Federal Proceeding to intervene in the First Federal Proceeding is pending.  Con Edison believes that Northeast Utilities materially breached the merger agreement, and that Con
Edison did not materially breach the merger agreement. Con Edison believes it was not obligated to acquire Northeast Utilities because Northeast Utilities did not meet the merger agreements conditions that Northeast Utilities perform all of
its obligations under the merger agreement. Those obligations include the obligation that it carry on its businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice; that the representations and warranties made by it in the merger agreement
were true and correct when made and remain true and correct; and that there be no material adverse change with respect to Northeast Utilities.  Con Edison is unable to predict whether or not any Northeast Utilities related lawsuits or other actions will have a material adverse effect on Con Edisons financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.  Note I Other
Material Contingencies Lower Manhattan Restoration Con Edison of New
York estimates that its costs for emergency response to the September11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, and for resulting temporary and subsequent permanent restoration of electric, gas and steam transmission and distribution
facilities damaged in the attack will total $430 million, net of insurance payments. Most of the costs, which are capital in nature, have already been incurred. At December31, 2005, the company had received reimbursement for $169 million of
these costs $76 million under insurance policies and $93 million from the federal government. The company expects to receive additional funds from insurance policies and federal reimbursement. At December31, 2005, the company had incurred
capital costs of $193 million and, pursuant to a petition it filed with the PSC in 2001, deferred non-capital costs of $135 million, including interest, as a regulatory asset these amounts are net of reimbursements received. The company expects
the PSC to permit recovery from customers of the costs, net of any federal reimbursement, insurance payments and tax savings.  Suits brought on behalf of several thousand plaintiffs alleged to have been working at the World Trade Center site following the attack are pending in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York against numerous parties, including the City of New York, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York. The suits generally seek unspecified amounts of damages allegedly resulting from exposure to hazardous
substances in connection with emergency response and restoration activities at the site. The Companies believe that their activities were prudent and in compliance with applicable laws. Neither of the Companies, however, is able to predict whether
or not any proceedings or other actions relating to the activities will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  Based upon New York Citys announced plans for improvement projects in lower Manhattan, the company anticipates that over the next five years it
may incur up to $250 million of costs to move its facilities to avoid interfering with these projects. The companys rate plans include provisions for the recovery of such costs. See Note B.  Generating Assets Sold To Mirant In June 1999, OR completed the sale of all of its generating assets and Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its two-thirds interest in the Bowline Point generating facility to affiliates of Mirant Corporation
formerly Southern Energy, Inc. The total gross proceeds from the sale amounted to $476 million $343 million attributable to OR and $133 million attributable to Con Edison of New York. In 2003, Mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a
voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Effective January3, 2006, Mirant and most of its subsidiaries, but not including the Mirant affiliates to which the OR and Con Edison of New York
generating assets referenced above were sold, emerged from bankruptcy.  The Utilities are
parties to an agreement with Mirant and its affiliates tolling the running of any statute of limitations with respect to any claim Mirant or its affiliates may have against the Utilities. Mirant has indicated that it is considering a lawsuit against
the Utilities in which it may seek to claim that some portion of what was paid in 1999 to purchase the generating assets exceeded the fair value of the assets. 
Mirant has also indicated that it may pursue claims against OR for compensation for certain system reliability services it alleges it provided to OR customers since
November 1999, as well as claims related to certain of the former OR facilities.  In
addition, Mirant has indicated in certain filings in its bankruptcy proceeding that under certain circumstances it would retire its 
95 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
Lovett generating units in 2007 and 2008. OR is in the process of upgrading its transmission and distribution system to meet anticipated demand growth, and
believes that by 2007 it would be able to meet existing transmission reliability criteria in the event that the Lovett units were shut down.  The Companies are unable to predict whether or not any Mirant related lawsuits or other actions will have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.  Guarantees Con Edison and its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance primarily to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. In addition,
a Con Edison Development subsidiary has issued a guarantee on behalf of an entity in which it has an equity interest. Maximum amounts guaranteed by Con Edison totaled $ 11 billion and $989 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Commodity Transactions Con
Edison guarantees payments on behalf of its subsidiaries in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity and related commodity services. In addition, a Con Edison Development
subsidiary has guaranteed payment for fuel oil purchases by a 42 MW foreign generating project in which it has an equity interest. To the extent that liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in
the consolidated balance sheet.  Affordable Housing Program Con
Edison Development guarantees the repurchase and remarketing obligations of one of its subsidiaries with respect to the debt relating to moderate-income rental apartment properties eligible for tax credits under Section42 of the Internal
Revenue Code. In accordance with EITF Issue No94-01, Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting from Investments in Affordable Housing Projects, neither the rental apartment properties nor the related indebtedness is included on Con
Edisons consolidated balance sheet.  Intra-company Guarantees 43 million relates to a guarantee issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Communications to Con Edison of New York for payment relating to the use of space in the latters
facilities and the construction of new telecommunications underground facilities. This guarantee will continue subsequent to the sale of Con Edison Communications with respect to facilities in operation at the time of sale. See NoteU. 41 million relates to commodity guarantees issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Solutions to OR and Con Edison of New York, respectively.
Other Guarantees Con Edison, Con Edison
Development and its subsidiaries also guarantee the following: 25 million for a parental guarantee provided by Con Edison on Con Edison Solutions indemnity agreement for surety bonds; 10 million for certain rent payment obligations of Con Edisons subsidiaries under various lease agreements for office buildings; 9 million for guarantees, standby financial letters of credit and comfort letters in connection with investments in energy infrastructure power and cogeneration projects; and 2 million for franchise agreements with the City of New York and other localities.  Note J Non-Utility Generators and Other Power Purchase Agreements The Utilities have long-term power purchase agreements PPAs with non-utility generators NUGs and others for generating capacity. The Utilities recover their purchase power costs in accordance with provisions approved by the applicable
state public utility commissions. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A.  96 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued

Amounts include payments under the PPA in effect prior to April 2004.  Note K Leases Con Edisons subsidiaries lease electric
generating and gas distribution facilities, other electric transmission and distribution facilities, office buildings and equipment. In accordance with SFAS No13, these leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases. Most
of the operating leases provide the option to renew at the fair rental value for future periods. Generally, it is expected that leases will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of business.  Capital leases: For ratemaking purposes capital leases are treated as operating leases; therefore, in
accordance with SFAS No71, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental payments recovered from customers. The following assets under capital leases are included in the Companies consolidated balance sheets at

Con Edison of New York has entered into a
10-year Revocable Consent Agreement the Agreement with New York City for the use of streets and public places for continued maintenance, operation, installation and removal of transformer vaults, transformers and appurtenant equipment
in vaults and on poles and other overhead structures, effective November1, 2004. The Agreement is renewable on one years notice. Payments by the company will increase by 28 percent annually, unless adjusted downward to reflect a
decrease in the number of transformer vaults and overhead transformers installed.  Lease In/Lease Out Transactions As part of a broad initiative, the Internal Revenue Service IRS is reviewing certain categories of transactions.
Among these are transactions in which a taxpayer leases property and then immediately subleases it back to the lessor termed Lease In/Lease Out, or LILO transactions. In 1997 and 1999, Con Edison
Development entered into LILO transactions, involving gas distribution and electric generating facilities in the Netherlands, with a total investment of $259 million. The transactions were financed with $93 million of equity and $166 million of
non-recourse, long-term debt secured by the underlying assets. In accordance with SFAS No13, Con Edison is accounting for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of
non-recourse debt, is carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive,
based upon the after-tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases. At December31, 2005 and 2004, the companys investment in these leveraged leases $225 million and $215 million, respectively net of deferred tax
liabilities $187 million and $165 million, respectively, amounted to $38 million and $50 million, respectively. The estimated tax savings from the two LILO transactions through December31, 2005, in the aggregate, was $137 million. On audit
of Con Edisons tax return for 1997, the IRS disallowed the tax losses in connection with the 1997 LILO transaction. Con Edison believes that its LILOs have been correctly reported. In December 2005, Con Edison paid a $03 million income tax deficiency asserted by the IRS for the tax year
1997 with respect to the 1997 LILO transaction. Con Edison intends to commence litigation in 2006 in federal court to obtain a refund of this tax payment.  In July 2005, the FASB issued a proposed FSP No. FAS 13-a, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a
Leveraged Lease Transaction. The proposed FSP would require the expected timing of income tax cash flows generated by Con Edisons LILO transactions to be reviewed at least annually. If the expected timing of the cash flows is revised,
the rate of return and the allocation of income would be recalculated from the inception of the LILO transactions, the company could be required to recalculate the accounting effect of the LILO transactions, which could result in a charge to
earnings that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.  Note L Goodwill and Intangible Assets In 2005 and 2004, Con Edison completed impairment tests for its goodwill of $406 million related
to the OR merger, and determined that it was not impaired. For the impairment test, $245 million and $161 million of the goodwill were allocated to Con Edison of New York and OR, respectively.  98 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued

In 2003, upon implementation of new FASB

value certain power sales contracts at Con Edison Development. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was an increase to net income of $8 million. The amortization expense was $10 million and
$11 million for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and is expected to be $10 million annually for the years 2006 through 2010.  Note M Income Tax The components of income tax are as follows:

Costs In August 2005, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2005-53 with respect to when federal income tax deductions can be taken for certain construction-related
costs. The Companies used the simplified service cost method SSCM to determine the extent to which these costs could be deducted in 2002, 2003 and 2004, and as a result reduced their current tax expense, by $289 million, of which
$264 million is attributable to Con Edison of New York. Under Revenue Ruling 2005-53, the Companies may be required to repay, with interest, a portion of their past SSCM tax benefits and to capitalize and depreciate over a period of years costs they
previously deducted under SSCM. The interest could range from zero to approximately $42 million. Repayment of the SSCM tax benefits would not otherwise affect the Utilities results of operations because deferred taxes have been previously
provided for the related temporary differences between the SSCM deductions taken for federal income tax purposes and the corresponding amounts charged to expense for financial reporting purposes.  Note N Stock-Based Compensation The Companies provide stock-based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units and contributions to a stock purchase plan.  Stock Options The Stock Option Plan the 1996 Plan provided for awards of stock options to officers and employees for up to 10million shares of the common stock.  The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP among other things, provides for awards of restricted stock units to officers, stock options to employees and
deferred stock units to Con Edisons non-officer directors for up to 10million shares of common stock of which not more than four million shares may be restricted stock or stock units. Stock options generally vest over a three-year period and have a term of ten years. Options are granted
at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a common share when the option was 
100 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
granted. Upon exercise of a stock option, the option holder may receive Con Edison common shares, cash, or a combination of both.  See Stock-Based Compensation in Note A for an illustration of the effect on net income and
earnings per share if the Companies had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123 to their stock-based employee compensation. The weighted average fair values of options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 are $451, $512 and
$430 per share, respectively. These values were estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:  2005

The exercise prices of options awarded in 2005 and 2004 range from $4218 to $4372 and from $4306 to $4410, respectively. Options outstanding awarded in prior years
have exercise prices equal to the weighted average exercise prices stated above.  Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock unit awards under the LTIP have been made as follows: iannual awards to officers under restricted
stock unit agreements that provide for adjustment of the number of units as described in the following paragraph; iithe directors deferred compensation plan; and iiirestricted stock unit agreements with three officers. Each
restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con Edison common stock, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof. 
The number of units in each annual restricted stock unit award under the LTIP is subject to adjustment as follows: i50 percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by
a factor that may range from 0 to 150 percent based on Con Edisons total shareholder return relative to the Standard Poors Electric Utilities Index during a specified performance period the TSR portion; and ii50
percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 150 percent based on determinations made in connection with Con Edison of New York Executive Incentive Plan or, for four officers, the OR Annual Team
Incentive Plan or goals relating to Con Edisons competitive businesses. Units vest when the performance period ends. In 2005, Con Edison recognized compensation expense of $4 million for the portion of the awards for which the performance
period ended December31, 2005.  Con Edison has a deferred stock compensation plan
for non-officer directors. Beginning in 2004, awards under the deferred compensation stock plan are covered by the LTIP. Pursuant to APB No25, Con Edison is recognizing compensation expense and accruing a liability for these units. Each
director receives 1,500 stock units for each year of service as a director. These stock units are deferred until the directors termination of service. Directors may elect to receive dividend equivalents earned on stock units in cash payments.
The compensation expense recognized by the Companies in relation to the non-officer
director deferred stock compensation plan in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1 million each year.  Pursuant to employment agreements, certain senior officers of Con Edison and its subsidiaries were granted restricted stock units, subject to the officers meeting the terms and conditions of the agreements. The units, each of which
represents the right to receive one share of Con Edison common stock, vest over various periods through March 2009 or immediately upon the occurrence of certain events. The restricted stock units granted in 2004
and 2005 were under the LTIP. Pursuant to APB No25, Con Edison is recognizing compensation expense and accruing a liability for the units over the vesting period. The following table summarizes restricted stock activity for the three years

Stock Purchase Plan The Stock Purchase Plan provides for the Companies to contribute $1 for each $9 invested by their directors, officers or employees to purchase Con Edison common stock under the
plan. Eligible participants may invest up to $25,000 during any calendar year subject to an additional limitation for officers and employees of not more than 20% of their pay. Dividends paid on shares held under the plan are reinvested in
additional shares unless otherwise directed by the participant. During 2005, 2004 and
2003, 590,413, 605,118 and 584,928 shares were purchased under the Stock Purchase Plan at a weighted average price of $4505, $4167 and $4056 per share, respectively.  Adoption of SFAS 123R In January 2006, Con Edison adopted
SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment. This Statement requires that the Companies recognize the cost of a transaction where it exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services as an expense on its income statement using a
fair-value measurement method. SFAS No123R provides for two alternative methods of adoption, the modified prospective application and the modified retrospective 
102 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
application. The modified prospective application applies to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the Statements effective date.
Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding after the Statements effective date will be recognized as the service is rendered on or after the effective
date. Alternatively, the modified retrospective application may be applied either to all prior years for which SFAS No123 was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption. The company has elected the modified
prospective application method for adopting SFAS No. 123R. The fair value of stock options, which contain an employee service condition, will be determined on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of the TSR
portion of performance-based restricted stock units, will be valued on the grant date using a model that accommodates the plans market-based conditions, with changes in fair value recorded in net income each reporting period. The fair value of
all other restricted stock units will be based upon the closing market price on the grant date with changes in fair value recorded in earnings each reporting period. Con Edison will also adopt a non-substantive vesting period approach to record
compensation expense related to retirement eligible employees. See Note A. The company elected to apply the provisions of FSP 123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards, to
determine the pool of tax benefits as of the adoption date of SFAS No123R. Beginning with adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Companies are computing diluted EPS using the treasury stock method, which considers unrecognized compensation cost
as well as the potential tax benefits or shortfalls that reflect the current market price and total compensation cost to be recognized.  In October 2005, the FASB issued FSP 123R-2, Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FASB Statement No123R. This FSP allows
companies to use the date the awards are approved as grant date in calculating the fair value as long as the awards are non-negotiable and the key terms and conditions are communicated to employees within a relatively short period of time. The
Companies will use the date the awards are approved as the grant date because both conditions are satisfied.  The company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No123R to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  Note O Financial Information By Business Segment The business segments of each of the Companies were determined based on managements reporting and decision-making requirements in accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information.  Con Edisons principal business segments are Con Edison
of New Yorks regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities, ORs regulated electric and gas utility activities and Con Edisons competitive businesses. Con Edison of New Yorks principal business segments are its
regulated electric, gas and steam utility activities. ORs principal business segments are its regulated electric and gas utility activities.  All revenues of these business segments, excluding revenues earned by Con Edison Development on certain energy infrastructure projects, which are deemed to be immaterial, are from
customers located in the United States of America. Also, all assets of the business segments, excluding certain investments in energy infrastructure projects by Con Edison Development $234 million at December31, 2005, are located in the
United States of America. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note A.  Common services shared by the business segments are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors, depending on the nature of the service provided.  103 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued

Note P Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as
amended SFAS No133. Under SFAS No133, derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, unless an exception is available under the standard. Certain qualifying derivative contracts have been designated as normal
purchases or normal sales contracts. These contracts are not reported at fair value under SFAS No133.  Energy Price Hedging Con Edisons subsidiaries hedge market price fluctuations associated with physical purchases and sales of
electricity, natural gas, and steam by using derivative instruments including futures, forwards, basis swaps, transmission congestion contracts and financial transmission rights contracts. The fair values of these hedges at December31, 2005
and 2004 were as follows:  Con Edison

Credit Exposure The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to over-the-counter transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and
the competitive energy businesses. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment
arrangements.  Con Edison and Con Edison of New York had $430 million and $204 million
credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral and reserves, at December31, 2005, respectively. Of these amounts, $308 million and $107 million was with investment-grade counterparties and $108
million and $97 million was primarily with the New York Mercantile Exchange, respectively.  Cash Flow Hedges Con Edisons subsidiaries designate a portion of derivative instruments as cash flow hedges under SFAS No133. Under cash
flow hedge accounting, to the extent a hedge is determined to be effective, the unrealized gain or loss on the hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income OCI and reclassified to earnings at the time the underlying transaction is
completed. A gain or loss relating to any portion of the hedge determined to be ineffective is recognized in earnings in the period in which such determination is made.  The following table presents selected information related to these cash flow hedges included in accumulated OCI at December31, 2005: Maximum Term

earnings may vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in market prices. The effect of reclassification from accumulated OCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged transaction in earnings.
The unrealized net gains and losses relating to the hedge ineffectiveness of these cash
flow hedges that were recognized in net earnings for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were immaterial to the results of operations of the Companies for those periods.  Other Derivatives The Companies enter into certain
derivative instruments that do not qualify or are not designated as hedges under SFAS No133. However, management believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. The Utilities
are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses record unrealized
gains and losses on these derivative contracts in earnings in the reporting period in which they occur. For the year ended December31, 2005, unrealized pre-tax losses amounting to $4 million were recorded in earnings as compared with $5
million of unrealized pre-tax gains for 2004 and $1 million of unrealized pre-tax losses for 2003.  Interest Rate Hedging Con Edisons subsidiaries use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure associated with debt. The
fair values of these interest rate swaps at December31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:  Con Edison Con EdisonofNewYork

Fair Value Hedges Con Edison of New
Yorks swap related to its $225 million of Series 2001A tax-exempt debt is designated as a fair value hedge, which qualifies for short-cut hedge accounting under SFAS No133. Under this method, changes in fair value of the
swap are recorded directly against the carrying value of the hedged bonds and have no impact on earnings.  Cash Flow Hedges Con Edison Developments and ORs swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No133. Any
gain or loss on the hedges is recorded in OCI and reclassified to interest expense and included in earnings during the periods in which the hedged interest payments occur. The contractual components of the interest rate swaps accounted for as cash
flow hedges are as follows:  Debt

In late 2004 and early 2005, Con Edison of New
York entered into forward starting swap agreements to hedge the interest payments associated with the anticipated issuance of $300 million of its debentures later in 2005. The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of each
hedge, the company locked in a swap rate that had a high correlation with the companys total borrowing costs. The swap agreements were settled in 2005 at the issuance of the debentures. A net loss of $4 million with respect to the swap
agreements was recorded in OCI in 2005, which will be reclassified to interest expense over the term of the related debentures.  The following table presents selected information related to these cash flow hedges included in the accumulated OCI at December31, 2005:

Interest Rate Swaps 11 2 1  The actual amounts that will be reclassified to
earnings may vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in interest rates. For the Utilities, these costs are recovered in rates and the reclassification will have no impact on results of operations.  Note Q Variable Interest Entities FASB Interpretation No46 revised December 2003, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, FIN 46R addresses the consolidation of a variable interest
entity VIE by a business enterprise that is the primary beneficiary. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose
equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the business enterprise that absorbs a majority of the VIEs expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both.
Con Edison enters into arrangements including leases, partnerships and PPAs, with
various entities. As a result of these arrangements, Con Edison retains or may retain a variable interest in these entities.  VIE assets and obligations included in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet are as follows:  Millions of Dollars
2005
2004
Non-utility plant and other assets 338 347
Debt and other liabilities 360 363
VIE assets include $338 million and $346 million
in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to a lease arrangement entered into by a Con Edison Development subsidiary in 2000, to finance the construction of a 525 MW gas-fired electric generating facility in Newington, New Hampshire the
facility. The debt and other liabilities related to the facility were $359 million and $362 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. At the expiration of the initial lease term in June 2010, the subsidiary has the option to extend the
lease or purchase the facility for the then outstanding amounts expended by the lessor for the facility. In the event the subsidiary chooses not to extend the lease or acquire the facility, Con Edison has guaranteed a residual value for an amount
not to exceed $240 million. The subsidiary also has contingent payment obligations to the lessor if an event of default should occur during the lease period. If the subsidiary were to default, its obligation would equal up to 100% of the
lessors investment in the facility plus all other amounts then due under the lease, which could exceed the aforementioned residual value guarantee. The subsidiarys payment and performance obligations are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by Con Edison. Upon adoption of FIN 46R in 2003, Con Edison recorded a $5 million after-tax charge 
106 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  Con Edison has a variable interest in a non-consolidated VIE related to Con Edison Developments sole limited interest in an affordable housing partnership that began in 2000.
Con Edison Developments maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIE is $6 million at December31, 2005 and 2004. In addition, Con Edison has guaranteed the debt undertaken by the partnership. See Note I.
Con Edison of New York did not apply FIN 46R to the following five potential VIEs with
which it has long-term PPAs: Sithe/Independence Partners, LP, East Coast Power, LLC, Selkirk Cogen Partners, LP, Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners, LP, and Indeck Energy Services of Corinth, Inc. In each quarter of 2005, requests were made of
the counterparties for information necessary to determine whether the entity was a VIE and whether Con Edison of New York is the primary beneficiary; however, the information was not made available. See Note J for information on these PPAs.
Note R Asset Retirement Obligations Con Edison and Con Edison of New York account for retirement obligations on their assets in accordance with SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS No143. This accounting standard requires recognition of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. When the liability is initially recorded, asset retirement costs are
capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.  The Utilities include in depreciation the estimated removal costs, less salvage, for utility plant
assets. In accordance with SFAS No143, future removal costs that do not represent legal asset retirement obligations are recorded as regulatory liabilities pursuant to SFAS No71. The related regulatory liabilities recorded for Con
Edison and Con Edison of New York were $558 million and $501 million in 2005 and $723 million and $666 million in 2004, respectively.  In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations An Interpretation of SFAS No143, which is effective for
fiscal years ending after December15, 2005. The Interpretation clarifies that a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity that is conditional on a future event is within the scope of SFAS No143. Accordingly, an entity is
required to recognize a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation that is conditional on a future event if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Interpretation
provides guidance for evaluating whether sufficient information is available to make a reasonable estimate of the fair value.  The Companies identified future asset retirement obligations associated with the removal of asbestos and asbestos-containing material in their buildings and equipment within the
generating stations and substations, and within the steam and gas distribution systems. The Companies also identified asset retirement obligations relating to gas pipelines abandoned in place. The estimates of future liabilities were developed using
historical information, and where available, quoted prices from outside contractors.  The
obligation for the cost of asbestos removal from the Companies generating stations and substation structures was not accrued since the retirement dates cannot be reasonably estimated.  In December 2005, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York recorded liabilities of $94 million and $93
million, respectively, for the fair value of their legal asset retirement obligations. In addition, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York increased utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, by $18 million and $17 million, respectively, for
asset retirement costs. Pursuant to SFAS No71, Con Edison of New York also recorded a reduction of $76 million to the regulatory liability associated with cost of removal to reflect accumulated depreciation and interest accretion costs for
the period between the date the obligations were incurred and the date FIN 47 was implemented by the Companies.  If the standard had been in effect as of December31, 2004, Con Edison and Con Edison of New York would have recorded asset retirement obligations of $94 million and $93
million, respectively.  Note S Related Party Transactions
The Utilities and Con Edisons competitive businesses provide administrative and other services to each other pursuant to cost allocation procedures
approved by the PSC. The costs of administrative and other services provided by Con Edison of New York and received by it from Con Edison and its competitive businesses for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

In addition, Con Edison of New York sold to
OR $185 million, $142 million and $128 million of natural gas for the years ended 
107 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts are net of the effect of related hedging transactions.  Con Edison of New York also sold to OR $16 million of electricity for the year ended
December31, 2003. This amount includes the net effect of all electric hedging transactions executed by Con Edison of New York on behalf of OR. In 2005 and 2004, such sales resulted in a net credit of $3 million and $2 million to OR,
reflecting hedging gains.  As a result of an auction held in October 2005, Con Edison of
New York entered into financial contracts with Con Edison Energy to hedge purchases of electricity in 2006. In accordance with SFAS No133, these intercompany contracts are recognized on Con Edison of New Yorks balance sheet at fair
value. At December31, 2005, Con Edison of New York recorded an unrealized loss of $9 million as a regulatory asset for such contracts. See Note P.  In December 2005, the FERC authorized Con Edison of New York to lend funds to OR, for periods of not more than 12 months, in amounts not to exceed $200 million outstanding at
any time, at prevailing market rates. OR has not borrowed any funds from Con Edison of New York.  Note T New Financial Accounting Standards In September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
reached a consensus on Issue 04-13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty EITF 04-13. The FASB Task Force concluded that inventory purchases and sales transactions with the same counterparty should
be combined for accounting purposes if they were entered into in contemplation of each other. The Task Force provided indicators to be considered for purposes of determining whether such transactions are entered into in contemplation of each other.
The Task Force also provided guidance on the circumstances under which nonmonetary exchanges of inventory within the same line of business should be recognized at fair value. EITF 04-13 will be effective for reporting periods beginning after
March15, 2006, although no final guidance has been provided on its applicability to the purchase and sale of electricity by utilities. The adoption of EITF 04-13 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.  In July 2005, the FASB issued Exposure
Draft titled Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an interpretation of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes the Exposure Draft. The proposed interpretation would clarify the accounting for uncertain
tax positions in accordance with FASB Statement No109. Under the interpretation, an enterprise would not be allowed to recognize, in its financial statements, the benefit of a tax position unless that
position will more likely than not be sustained on audit by taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position. The IRS has completed its audits of the Companies tax returns through 1996. The Companies tax returns
for subsequent years, which the IRS is reviewing, reflect certain tax positions with which the IRS does not or may not agree, including tax positions with respect to Con Edisons leveraged lease transactions and the deduction of certain
construction-related costs. See Lease In/Lease Out Transactions in Note K and Timing of Deduction of Construction-Related Costs in Note M. As to Con Edisons other tax positions, the Companies are unable to predict
whether the Exposure Draft, if adopted in its present form, would have a material impact on their financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In June 2005, the Derivatives Implementation Group DIG task force of the FASB issued guidance on SFAS No133 implementation, Issue No. B38, which provides guidance on
whether the potential settlement of the debtors obligation to the creditor that would occur upon exercise of a put option or call option embedded in a debt instrument meets the criteria for net settlement. The DIG also issued guidance on SFAS
No133 implementation, Issue No. B39, which clarifies that certain conditions in the evaluation of embedded derivative debt instruments do not apply to an embedded call option if the right to accelerate the settlement of the debt can be
exercised only by the debtor issuer/borrower. Both these DIG issues are effective in the first fiscal quarter after December15, 2005. The adoption of Issue Nos. B38 and B39 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In June 2005, the EITF reached a
consensus on Issue 05-6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements EITF 05-6, which is effective for periods beginning after June30, 2005. EITF 05-6 states that leasehold improvements acquired in a business
combination and those acquired after the inception of a lease should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the acquisition of the leasehold
improvements. The adoption of EITF 05-6 did not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement No154, Accounting for Changes and Error Corrections SFAS No154, which is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2005. This statement replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No20, Accounting Changes APB 20 and FASB Statement No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.
APB 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in 
108 Table of Contents Notes to the Financial Statements Continued 
accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS
No154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The
adoption of SFAS No154 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In March 2005, the FASB issued FSP FIN 46R-5, Implicit Variable Interests under FASB Interpretation No46 revised December 2003, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities. This FSP is effective as of April1, 2005. The FSP requires a company to consider whether it holds an implicit variable interest in a variable interest entity VIE or potential VIE. An implicit interest involves the
absorbing and/or receiving of variability indirectly from the VIE, and may take many different forms such as a lessee under a leasing arrangement or a party to a supply contract, service contract or derivative contract. The adoption of FSP
FIN 46R-5 did not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No29. APB No29 requires exchanges
of nonmonetary assets to be measured on the basis of the fair value of the assets exchanged, with certain exceptions. SFAS No153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general
exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance, that is, transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the future cash flows of the reporting entity. This Statement is effective for
nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No153 did not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB
No43, Chapter 4. This Statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. The Statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning
after June15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No151 did not have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  Note U Con Edison Communications CEC In 2003, Con Edison decided to consider various strategic alternatives for its telecommunications business. Testing of CECs assets for impairment, in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets, resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $140 million. In addition, $1 million of pre-tax capitalized interest at Con Edison, related to the investment in CEC, was deemed impaired.
In December 2004, Con Edison signed an agreement to sell CEC to FiberNet Telecom Group,
Inc. FiberNet for approximately $37 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. In May 2005, Con Edison and FiberNet mutually agreed to terminate their agreement for the sale of CEC.  In December 2005, Con Edison signed an agreement to sell CEC to RCN Corporation RCN for approximately
$32 million in cash, including the discharge of certain intercompany liabilities, and subject to certain adjustments. The sale is subject to review or approval by the City of New York, the PSC and various federal, state and local regulators.
CECs assets held for sale were tested for impairment in December 2005, which resulted in an after-tax impairment charge of $5 million reflected in losses from discontinued operations. Exit costs associated with the disposal activity include
one-time termination benefits and other transaction costs of $5 million, of which $3 million has been incurred to date. The company expects to complete the sale in 2006. The sale is not expected to have a material impact on Con Edisons
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  Con Edison of New York receives
lease payments from CEC for the right to use its electric conduit system in accordance with the tariff approved by PSC. Subsequent to the sale, Con Edison of New York will continue to receive such lease payments from RCN. The continuing cash flows
related to the lease payments are not considered significant in relation to the revenues expected to be generated by the CEC business.  In accordance with SFAS No144, in 2004, CECs assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale on Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and
effective December1, 2004, CEC ceased recording depreciation expense. CECs total operating revenues were $42 million, $33 million and $19 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of
December31, 2005, CEC had assets and liabilities of $60 million and $21 million, respectively. CECs losses, net of income taxes, are reported as Discontinued operations on Con Edisons consolidated income statement.
Losses for 2003 have been restated to conform to the 2005 and 2004 presentation.  109 Table of Contents
