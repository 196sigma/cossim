NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization
SDL, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation, designs, manufactures, and
markets semiconductor optoelectronic integrated circuits OEICs, semiconductor
lasers, fiber optic related products, and optoelectronic systems. The Company
revenue is derived from: i the sale of standard and customized products to a
diverse worldwide customer base utilizing various market applications and, ii
customer-funded research programs, principally through various government
agencies.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SDL, Inc. and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, SDL Optics, Inc. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The functional currency of the Company
foreign subsidiary is the U.S. dollar. Subsidiary financial statements are
remeasured into U.S. dollars for consolidation. Foreign currency transaction
gains and losses are included in other income expense and were immaterial for
all periods presented. Beginning with 1997, the Company operates and reports
financial results on a fiscal year of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Friday
closest to December 31. Accordingly, fiscal 1997 ended on January 2, 1998 and
was a 53 week year with the fourth fiscal quarter having 14 weeks. For ease of
discussion and presentation all years are referred to as ending on December 31.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.
Investments
The Company has classified its entire investment portfolio as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair market
value. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is included
in interest income. Realized gains and losses are included in other income
expense. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification
method.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out basis or
market. The market value is based upon estimated net realizable value.
Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment and fixtures are
depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging
from two to eight years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the
remaining lease terms.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangibles
Goodwill and other purchased intangibles are being amortized using the
straight-line method over three to seven years.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognition is based on the terms of the underlying sales agreements
purchase orders or contracts. Revenue for product sales is recognized upon
shipment. Revenue for costs incurred plus specified fee contracts is recognized
on the percentage-of-completion method. Revenue for fixed price milestone
contracts is recognized upon the completion of the milestone. Customers entering
into cost incurred and fixed price contracts with the Company include the U.S.
government,                     31
32
prime or subcontractors for which the U.S. government may be the end customer,
and other domestic and international end-users.
Concentrations
Customer - The Company received approximately 19 percent, 21 percent and
19 percent of its 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively, revenue from
Lockheed-Martin through several government and commercial programs.
Almost all of the Company revenue from this customer during 1997, 1996
and 1995 was derived from Federally-funded programs. Most of the
Company Federally-funded programs are subject to renewal every one or
two years and to termination for convenience by the government agency.
The loss of the Company contracts with Lockheed-Martin, or other major
customers, could have an adverse effect on the Company results of
operations.
Dependence Upon Government Programs and Contracts - In 1997, 1996, and
1995, the Company derived approximately 38 percent, 43 percent, and 45
percent, respectively, of its revenue directly and indirectly from a
variety of Federal government sources. The demand for certain of the
Company services and products is directly related to the level of
funding of government programs. The Company believes that the success
and further development of its business is dependent, in significant
part, upon the continued existence and funding of such programs and upon
the Company ability to participate in such programs. For example,
substantially all of the Company research revenue for 1997, 1996, and
1995 was funded by Federal programs. There can be no assurance that such
programs will continue to be funded even if government agencies have
available financial resources or that the Company will continue to be
awarded contracts under such programs.
Approximately 5 percent of the Company 1997 revenue and 6 percent of
revenue in 1996 was received through certain Federal government programs
which required that participants meet specific eligibility requirements.
During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company exceeded the maximum
number of employees allowed under these eligibility requirements and the
Company is no longer able to compete for future research contract awards
under these government programs. Loss of eligibility under these
programs does not disqualify the Company from contracts awarded prior to
the loss of eligibility. Loss of eligibility under these programs could
require increased internally funded research and development spending.
Dependence on Single Source and Other Third Party Suppliers - The
Company depends on a single or limited number of outside contractors and
suppliers for raw materials, packages and standard components, and to
assemble printed circuit boards. The Company generally purchases these
single or limited source products through standard purchase orders or
one-year supply agreements and has no long-term guaranteed supply
agreements with such suppliers. While the Company seeks to maintain a
sufficient safety stock of such products and also endeavors to maintain
ongoing communications with its suppliers to guard against interruptions
or cessation of supply, the Company business and results of operations
have in the past been and could in the future be adversely affected by a
stoppage or delay of supply, substitution of more expensive or less
reliable products, receipt of defective parts or contaminated materials,
an increase in the price of such supplies, or the Company inability to
obtain reduced pricing from its suppliers in response to competitive
pressures.
Credit Risk - The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers' financial condition and generally requires no collateral from
its customers. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit
losses. Although such losses have been within management expectations
to date, there can be no assurance that such reserves will continue to
be adequate.                    32
33
Principal Business and Export Sales 
The Company operations are conducted in one principal line of business, the
design, manufacture, and sale of semiconductor optoelectronic integrated
circuits, semiconductor lasers, fiber optic products, and optoelectronic
systems. The Company has operations in the United States and international
operations in Canada.
All sales to international customers constitute export sales and are denominated
in U.S. dollars. Export sales to Europe totaled approximately $79 million, $42
million, and $43 million for 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. Export sales
to the Pacific Rim totaled approximately $73 million, $80 million, and $79
million for 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.
Net Income Loss Per Share
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 128,
Earnings per Share. Statement 128 replaced the calculation of primary and fully
diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike
primary earnings per share, basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive
effects of options, warrants and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per
share is very similar to the previously reported fully diluted earnings per
share. All earnings per share amounts for all periods have been presented, and
where appropriate, restated to conform to the Statement 128 requirements.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
share                               AS OF DECEMBER 31,
1997     1996     1995

plans are not included in the 1997 or 1995 calculation due to their
anti-dilutive effect on the loss per share.
In May 1996, the Board of Directors authorized a three-for-two split of its
common stock, effected in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend, which was
paid on June 12, 1996 to stockholders of record on May 5, 1996. All share and
per share data in these financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split.
Recent Pronouncements
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement Number
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This statement requires that all items that
are to be required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of
comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with
the same prominence as other financial statements. This statement is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997, and will be adopted by the
Company for the year ended December 31, 1998.                    33
34
In addition, during June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement Number 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. This statement replaces Statement Number 14 and changes the way
public companies report segment information. This statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997 and will be adopted by the
Company for the year ended December 31, 1998. 2. INVESTMENTS

The tax benefits resulting from the exercise of nonqualified stock options and
the disqualifying disposition of shares acquired under the Company incentive
stock option and employee stock purchase plans were zero, $52 million and $25
million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Such benefits were credited to
additional paid-in capital.

Total deferred tax liabilities       1,112    1,049
Net deferred tax assets          $ 3,052    $ 3,052
The valuation allowance increased by approximately $120 million in 1997 and
decreased by $03 million in 1996. Approximately $33 million of the valuation
allowance is related to the benefits of stock option deductions, which will be
credited to paid-in capital when realized.
As of December 31, 1997, the Company had federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $26 million and $15 million, respectively, and
federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $06 million and
$06 million, respectively. The net operating loss and credit carryforwards will
expire at various dates beginning in years 2001 through 2012, if not utilized.
Management has determined, based on the Company history of prior operating
earnings, its expectations for the future, and the extended period over which
the benefits of certain deferred tax assets will be realized, that a partial
valuation allowance should be provided. The realization of the Company net
deferred tax assets, which relate primarily to temporary differences, net
operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent on
generating sufficient                     37
38
taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences are
expected to reverse. Although realization is not assured, management believes it
is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized.
9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Stock Split
In May 1996, the Board of Directors authorized a three-for-two split of its
common stock, effected in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend, which was
paid on June 12, 1996 to stockholders of record on May 15, 1996. All share and
per share data in these financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split.
Common Stock Offerings
On March 15, 1995, the Company issued 3,600,000 shares of common stock in
conjunction with its initial public offering at a per share price of $1067. Net
proceeds to the Company amounted to approximately $348 million. Of the net
proceeds, approximately $216 million and $24 million were used to repay the
entire principal amount outstanding under the Company subordinated notes due
in 1997, and the Company bank line of credit and term loan, respectively.
Concurrent with the offering, a 34-for-1 split of the Company common stock
was authorized and all of the convertible redeemable preferred stock was
converted into 1,385,302 shares of common stock.
On August 1, 1995, the Company issued 600,000 shares of common stock in a
follow-on public stock offering at a per share price of $2300, resulting in net
proceeds to the Company of approximately $126 million.
On June 26, 1996, the Company issued 1,500,000 shares of common stock in a
follow-on public stock offering at a per share price of $2700. In addition,
SDL Underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase 255,000
additional shares of the Company common stock. Net proceeds to the Company
approximated $447 million.
Stockholders' Notes Receivable
Certain exercises of stock options occurred in conjunction with the issuance of
full-recourse stockholders' notes receivable. The notes bear interest between 5
percent and 8 percent per annum with annual interest payments. The principal on
the notes is due five years after issuance between 1998 and 2001.
10.   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
Stock Option Plans
The 1992 Stock Option Plan provided for the granting of incentive stock options
and nonqualified options to purchase up to 4,558,125 shares of the Company
common stock to officers, directors and key employees at exercise prices of not
less than fair value on the date of grant as determined by a committee of the
Board of Directors. Options granted were immediately exercisable; however,
unexercised options and shares purchased upon the exercise of the options are
subject to vesting over a one- to five-year period. Shares not vested at the
date of termination of employment may be repurchased by the Company at the
original exercise price. No further options will be granted under the 1992 Stock
Option Plan.
The Company 1995 Stock Option Plan was approved by the Board of Directors in
January 1995 and by the stockholders in February 1995. The purposes of the 1995
Option Plan are to give the Company employees and others who perform
substantial services to the Company incentive, through ownership of the
Company common stock, to continue in service to the Company, and to help the
Company compete effectively with other enterprises for the services of qualified
individuals. The 1995 Stock Option Plan permits the grant of incentive stock
options to employees, including officers and Directors who are employees, and
the award of nonqualified stock options to the Company employees, officers,
Directors, independent contractors, and consultants. The number of shares
available for grant was initially 712,500 shares. Beginning on the first day of
each fiscal year, the number of shares reserved for grant will be increased by 5
percent of the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of the
preceding fiscal year. Options granted under the 1995 Stock Option Plan are
subject to vesting over a one- to five-year period and must generally be
exercised by the optionee                     38
39
during the period of employment or service with the Company or within a
specified period following termination of employment or service. Options
currently expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
The Company has reserved 3,102,070 shares of common stock for future issuance
under its Stock Option Plans as of December 31, 1997.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
To provide employees with an opportunity to purchase common stock of the Company
through payroll deductions, the Company established the 1995 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the ESPP and initially reserved 450,000 shares of common stock
for issuance to participants. Under the ESPP, the Company employees, subject
to certain restrictions, may purchase shares of common stock at the lesser of 85
percent of the fair market value at either the beginning of each two-year
offering period or the end of each six-month purchase period within the two-year
offering period. Under the ESPP, the Company sold 118,690, 110,658 and 48,584
shares in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has elected to following Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related interpretations
in accounting for its employee stock-based awards because, as discussed below,
the alternative fair value accounting provided for under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing stock-based compensation plans. Under APB 25, the Company generally
recognizes no compensation expense with respect to such awards.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
SFAS 123 as if the Company has accounted for its employee stock options granted
subsequent to December 31, 1994 under the fair value method. The fair value for
these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Since the Company stock-based awards have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and since changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair vale estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its stock-based awards. The fair value of
the Company stock-based awards to employees was estimated assuming no expected
dividends and the following weighted-average assumptions                    Options                 ESPP

For the purpose of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the above
stock-based awards is amortized over the awards' vesting period. The Company
pro forma information follows in thousands, except for per share information                             1997      1996     1995

Pro-forma net income loss per share - diluted    $ 204    $ 045    $ 035 Because SFAS 123 is applicable only to options granted subsequent to December
31, 1994, its pro forma effect will not be fully reflected until approximately
1999.
Weighted-average fair value of options granted during 1997, 1996 and 1995 were
$892, $965 and $580, respectively. The weighted-average fair value of ESPP
rights granted in 1997, 1996 and 1995 were $564, $397 and $201, respectively.                    40

11. ACQUISITIONS
In November 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Mr.
Laser, Inc., a company involved in the design and development of compact laser
marking systems. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. The total purchase price was approximately $1,202,000, which
includes related transaction costs of $22,000, $187,000 for net acquired
liabilities and $650,000 for future cash payments. The Company recorded $753,000
as in-process research and development for development projects that had not yet
reached technologic feasibility. To determine the value of in-process research
and development, the Company considered, among other factors, the state of
development of the compact laser marking system, the costs needed to complete
development, and the expected income and risks associated with the inherent
difficulties and uncertainties in completing development. Purchase price in
excess of amounts allocated to in-process research and development and net
acquired liabilities was approximately $453,000 and was allocated to goodwill.
Goodwill is being amortized straight-line over a three year life. Mr. Laser
operating results are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements from November 1997. The results of Mr. Laser prior to the acquisition
were not material to the Company consolidated results of operations.
In November 1995, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of Seastar Optics, Inc. Seastar, a British Columbia corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Axys Group Ltd. The assets acquired
consisted of accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, research and development
in process, patents and other intellectual property rights, and all other
tangible and intangible assets used by Seastar in the operation of its business.
The transaction has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
On March 31, 1997, the Company paid the final acquisition obligation of $27
million.
12. COMMITMENTS
The Company leases all of its facilities and certain equipment under operating
leases. The operating facilities leases contain renewal options. The future
minimum rental payments as of December 31, 1997, under operating leases are as

13. CONTINGENCIES
In 1985, Rockwell International Corporation Rockwell asserted, and in 1995
filed suit against the Company alleging that a Company fabrication process
infringed certain Rockwell patent rights. Rockwell sought to permanently enjoin
the Company from infringing Rockwell alleged patent rights and sought
unspecified actual and treble damages plus costs. The Company answered
Rockwell complaint asserting, among other defenses, that Rockwell patent is
invalid. In addition, the Federal government, which is a defendant in a suit
brought by Rockwell relating to certain of the same alleged patent rights,
asserted that the Company may be liable to indemnify the Federal government for
certain of Rockwell claims. The Company intervened in Rockwell suit against
the Federal government. Rockwell suit against the Company was stayed in 1995
pending resolution of Rockwell suit against the Federal government. In
February 1997, the court in the Federal government suit declared the Rockwell
patent invalid and entered judgment in favor of the Company and the Federal
government. Rockwell has appealed the Court decision to the U. S. Circuit
court for the Federal Circuit. Oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for
March 3, 1998. If the favorable decision of the Court of Federal Claims were
reversed on appeal, then litigation of Rockwell claim against the Company
would be expected to involve significant expense to the Company and to divert
the attention of the Company technical and management personnel and could have                    41
42
a material adverse effect on the Company business and results of operations.
The Company believes the judgment in favor of the Company will also result in a
favorable disposition of Rockwell suit against the Company.
Trial of the Spectra-Physics vs. SDL, Inc. litigation began before the Santa
Clara County, California Superior Court on May 7, 1997. On May 19, 1997, before
the trial was concluded, the Company, Spectra-Physics and its subsidiary Opto
Power Corporation, and Xerox Corporation made a comprehensive settlement of
their disputes.
During the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company included approximately
$275 million in general and administrative expenses for settlement and related
legal costs associated with the resolution of the dispute with Spectra-Physics,
Inc.
SDL is engaged in various cost-reimbursement type contracts with the Federal
government. These contracts utilize allowable costs plus contract fee to
determine revenue. Federally-funded contracts are subject to audit of pricing
and actual costs incurred, which have resulted and could result in the future,
in price adjustments. The government has in the past and could in the future,
challenge the Company accounting methodology for computing indirect rates and
allocating indirect costs to government contracts. The government is currently
challenging certain indirect cost allocations. While management believes that
amounts recorded on its financial statements are adequate to cover all related
risks, the government has not concluded its investigation or agreed to a
settlement with the Company. Although the outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time, management does not believe that its outcome will have
a material adverse effect on the Company financial position, results of
operations and cash flows. However, based on future developments, the Company
estimate of the outcome of these matters could change in the near term. 14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

well as the Company matching contributions are fully vested. Company
