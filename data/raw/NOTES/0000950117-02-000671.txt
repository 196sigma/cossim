ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Report of Independent Auditors The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Vion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Vion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a
development stage company as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 and the period
from May 1, 1994 inception to December 31, 2001. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Vion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 and the period
from May 1, 1994 inception to December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.                           /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

A Development Stage Company
Notes to Financial Statements 1. The Company
Vion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the Company is a development stage
biopharmaceutical company engaged in the research, development and
commercialization of therapeutics and technologies for the treatment of cancer.
The Company was incorporated in March 1992 as a Delaware Corporation and began
operations on May 1, 1994.
In April 1995, the Company merged into OncoRx Research Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of MelaRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. MelaRx and the Company name was
changed to OncoRx, Inc. The stockholders of the Company were issued 2,654,038
common and 23,859 preferred shares of MelaRx in exchange for all 2,000,000
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company valued at $216 per share
fair value. As the shareholders of the Company obtained a majority interest in
the merged company, for accounting purposes the Company is treated as the
acquirer. Therefore, the transaction was recorded as a purchase in the Company
financial statements, which include the results of operations of the Company
from inception and MelaRx from the date of acquisition. The $45 million excess
of cost over the fair value of MelaRx net tangible assets was treated as
purchased research and development and expensed immediately.

4 resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $97 million.
In April 1996, the Company name was changed to Vion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents include investments with original maturities of three months or
less.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The estimated fair value of amounts reported in the financial statements has
been determined by using available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies. All current assets and current liabilities are carried at cost,
which approximates fair value, because of their short-term nature, except
short-term investments, which are carried at market.
36 Investments
The Company accounts for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities. The Company investments in debt and equity securities,
which typically mature in one year or less, are classified as available for sale
and are carried at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the
related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings
and are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.
The cost, gross unrealized holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses and
fair value for available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were
as follows in thousands                              Gross        Gross

As of 12/31/00       $18,040       $140         $20       $18,160
No realized gains or losses related to investments have been incurred to date.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of equipment is computed
under the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are carried at cost
and amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the
estimated useful lives of the assets.
The following is a summary of property and equipment as of December 31 in
thousands                              2001          2000

the period from inception May 1, 1994 through December 31, 2001.

Class A Convertible Preferred Stock
In May 1996, the Company completed a private placement of 1,250,000 shares of
Class A Convertible Preferred Stock Class A Stock, at $1000 per share,
resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $115 million. Each share of Class A

stock. The Company recorded an imputed one-time                    42 non-cash dividend of approximately $114 million as a result of the difference
between the conversion price and the quoted market price of the Company common
stock as of the date of issuance as required by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force D-60, Accounting for the Issuance of
Convertible Preferred Stock and Debt Securities with a Nondetachable Conversion
Feature EITF D-60. The $114 million has been recognized as a charge against

Preferred Stock and the loss applicable to common shareholders. In connection
with the foregoing transaction, the Company issued warrants to the placement
agent, expiring May 22, 2001 the Expiration Date, to purchase an aggregate
of 546,875 shares of the Company common stock at prices ranging from $396 to

quoted market price of the common stock as of the date of the issuance of the
preferred dividends of approximately $02 million and $04 million in 2000 and
1999, respectively. The non-cash dividend has been included in the dividend
requirement on Preferred Stock and the loss applicable to common shareholders.

adjustment provisions of the Company outstanding warrants, resulting in the
issuance of additional warrants.

B Stock were immediately convertible into shares of common stock including an
accretion of 8% per annum. The difference between the conversion price and the
quoted market price of the Company common stock at the date of issuance of
$04 million was recognized upon the issuance of the Class B Stock as a charge
against accumulated deficit, with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in
capital. The imputed non-cash dividend has been included in the dividend
requirement on Preferred Stock and the loss applicable to common shareholders.
Shares of the Class B Stock were eligible, under certain circumstances, to
receive dividends paid in Class C Convertible Preferred Stock Class C Stock.
The Class C Stock was immediately convertible into shares of common stock at the
average closing bid price of the Company common stock for thirty consecutive
business days ending on the private placement closing date and was not entitled
to dividends.                    43 Conversions of Class B Stock from January 1, 1998 through August 10, 1998,
resulted in Class C dividends representing 180,141 shares of common stock valued
at $06 million. In addition, the Company recorded accretion of 37,168 shares of
common stock valued at $01 million in 1997, and 61,078 shares of common stock
valued at $03 million through August 10, 1998. These dividends were recorded as
a charge against accumulated deficit, with a corresponding increase in paid-in
capital. The dividends have been included in the dividend requirement on

accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force
D-42, The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings Per Share for the Redemption or
Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock, the excess of the fair value of the
common stock issued upon conversion over the fair value of the common stock
issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of $04 million, has been
added to the dividend requirement to arrive at loss applicable to common
shareholders. In addition, holders of the Class B Stock waived their
antidilution rights arising from the issuance of the 5% Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Stock Series 1998.
5% Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Series 1998

share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $47 million. The shares of
Series 1998 Preferred Stock accrued dividends of 5% per annum payable in-kind.

based on the formula of issued price plus accrued dividends divided by $360. In
connection with the sale of the Series 1998 Preferred Stock, the Company imputed
a one-time non-cash dividend of approximately $16 million as a result of the
difference between the conversion price and the quoted market price of the
Company common stock at the date of issuance as required by EITF D-60. Such
amount was recognized upon issuance of the Series 1998 Preferred Stock as a
charge against the accumulated deficit with a corresponding increase to
additional paid-in capital. The imputed non-cash dividend has been included in
the dividend requirement on Preferred Stock and the loss applicable to common
shareholders. The dividend requirement on Preferred Stock also reflects the
amortization of the costs of completing the offering and the accretion of the 5%
per annum dividend. The 5% accretion resulted in a charge against the
accumulated deficit with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in-capital
of $04 million and $03 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The issuance of the Series 1998 Preferred Stock at closing also
triggered certain antidilution adjustment provisions of the Company
outstanding warrants, resulting in the issuance of additional warrants.
The Company common stock traded above $720 for a period of 20 consecutive
trading days ending on February 7, 2000 and, in accordance with the terms of the
Series 1998 Preferred Stock, all of the outstanding preferred shares having a
redemption value of $54 million were                    44 automatically converted into 1,507,024 common shares at the $360 conversion
price, effective February 22, 2000.

was made to the exercise price of the Class A Warrants and the Class B Warrants
and there was a corresponding distribution of additional Class A Warrants and

5. Employee Stock Option Plans
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related Interpretations
in accounting for its employee stock options because, as discussed below, the
alternative fair value accounting provided for under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use
in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, if the exercise price of the
Company employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock
on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
In July 1995, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Amended and
Restated 1993 Stock Option Plan the Option Plan. The Option Plan, as
subsequently amended, provides for the granting of both incentive stock options
and nonqualified stock options to employees, officers, directors and consultants
of the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of 4285 million shares of common
stock. Incentive options granted under the Option Plan are exercisable for a
period of up to ten years from the date of grant at an exercise price which is
not less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant
except that the term of an incentive option granted under the Option Plan to a
stockholder owning more than 10% of the outstanding voting power may not exceed
five years and its exercise price may not be less than 110% of the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options granted to date under
the Option Plan become exercisable in no less than four equal annual
installments commencing no earlier than the first anniversary of the date of
grant except for certain options granted in 2001 that become exercisable in
either one or two equal annual installments. No option may be granted under the
Option Plan after April 14, 2003. The Company recognized compensation expense of
$01 million, $01 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively, related to options granted under the Option Plan.
Options granted outside the Option Plan include stock options to purchase
980,000 shares of common stock granted to the Company Chief Executive Officer
under the Senior Executive Stock Option Plan. There are no additional shares
available for issuance under this plan.
The provisions of the Option Plan provide for the automatic grant of
non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock Director
Options to directors of the Company who are not employees or principal
stockholders of the Company Eligible Directors. Eligible Directors are
granted a Director Option to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock on the date
such person is first elected or appointed a director an Initial Director
Option. Each Eligible Director, other than directors who received an Initial
Director Option since the last annual meeting, is granted a Director Option to
purchase 15,000 shares 20,000 shares for the Chairman of the Board of common
stock on the day immediately following the date of each annual meeting of
stockholders, as long as such director is a member of the Board of Directors.
The exercise price for each share subject to a Director Option shall be equal to
the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Director Options
are exercisable in two equal annual installments for 2000 grants and in four
equal annual installments for grants prior to 2000                    47 commencing one year from the date of grant. Eligible Directors agreed to accept
options exercisable in one year in lieu of cash payments for board fees for
meetings held from December 2001 to December 2002. Director Options expire the
earlier of ten years after the date of grant or ninety days after the
termination of the director service on the Board of Directors. The number of
Director Options granted were 104,346, 115,000 and 110,000 in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
SFAS 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its
employee stock options under the fair value method. The fair value of options
granted under the Option Plan was estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions for 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 46%, 60% and 51 volatility factors of the expected market price of the Company common stock of
1002, 1455 and 0656; weighted-average expected option life of 7 years; and no
dividend yield.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that do not have vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options and, because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure
of the fair value of its employee stock options.

49 6. 401k Savings Plan
Beginning April 1, 2000, the Company commenced matching contributions under a
401k Savings Plan in either cash or its common stock, at the election of the
employee. For stock matches, the contribution rate is 40% of an employee
contribution, up to an annual maximum match of stock valued at $1,500. For cash
matches, the contribution rate is 30% of an employee contributions, up to an
annual maximum match of $1,000. The expense for the matching contribution for
the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $46,000 and $56,000,
respectively. 5,732 shares were issued in 2001 for the 401k stock match.
7. Stock Purchase Plan
A total of 450,000 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the
Company employee stock purchase plan the Stock Plan effective January 1,
2001. The Stock Plan permits eligible employees to purchase up to 2,000 shares
of common stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock
at the beginning or at the end of each six-month offering period. 4,457 shares
were issued in 2001 under the Stock Plan.
8. Income Taxes
At December 31, 2001, the Company has available for federal income tax purposes
net operating loss carryforwards, subject to review by the Internal Revenue
Service, totaling $566 million and a general business tax credit of $22
million expiring in 2010 through 2021. The difference between the deficit
accumulated during the development stage for financial reporting purposes and
the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes is primarily due to
certain costs which are not currently deductible for tax purposes and
differences in accounting and tax basis resulting from the merger described in
Note 1. Significant differences have resulted from amortizing previously
capitalized research and development expenses. The ability of the Company to
realize a future tax benefit from a portion of its net operating loss
carryforwards and general business credits may be limited due to changes in
ownership of the Company. The U.S. statutory rate is 34%; however, the Company
has recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes in the financial
statements due to recurring losses. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full
valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance
increased by $62 million and $63 million during 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The significant components of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities
are as follows in thousands                                            December 31,
