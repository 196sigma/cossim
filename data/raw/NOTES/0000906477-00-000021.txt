NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1.Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of business
Paul-Son Gaming Corporation, including its subsidiaries collectively Paul-Son or the Company, is a leading manufacturer and supplier of casino table game equipment in the United States. The Company products include casino
chips, table layouts, playing cards, dice, furniture, table accessories and other products which are used with casino table games such as blackjack, poker, baccarat, craps and roulette. The Company sells its products in every state in which casinos
operate in the United States and, to a limited extent, in various countries throughout the world.
Basis of consolidation and presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Paul-Son and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Paul-Son Gaming Supplies, Inc. Paul-Son Supplies, Paul-Son Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. Mexicana and Authentic Products,
Inc. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
A summary of the Company significant accounting policies follows:
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments and repurchase agreements with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents
Trade receivables and Customer deposits
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally requires a fifty percent deposit for manufactured or purchased products at the discretion of management. These customer deposits are classified as a
current liability on the balance sheet. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, and charges against the allowance have been within management expectations see Note9.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method.
36
PAUL-SON GAMING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation. The Company includes capitalized lease equipment in its property and equipment for financial statement purposes. Depreciation is computed primarily on the straight-line
method for financial reporting purposes over the following estimated useful lives Years Buildings and improvements 18-27 Furniture and equipment 5-10 Vehicles 5-7 Normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures which extend useful lives of assets are typically capitalized. 
Other assets
Included in other assets are goodwill and costs associated with the acquisition of a patent. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years and patent costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 years.
Debt
The Company includes obligations from capitalized leases in its long and short-term debt captions for financial statement purposes.
Revenue recognition
Substantially all revenue is recognized when products are shipped to customers. The Company typically sells its products with payment terms of net 30 days or less.
Income taxes
The Company uses Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109 for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. A current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on
tax returns for the current year. A deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects, based on provisions of the enacted law, attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards.
Foreign transactions
Sales outside of the United States are not significant and substantially all sales transactions occur in United States dollars.

PAUL-SON GAMING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions have been made in determining the depreciable
lives of assets, the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, and the allowance for obsolete or slow moving inventories. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Reliance on suppliers
For certain of its products, the Company is dependent upon a limited number of suppliers to provide the Company with raw materials for manufacturing and finished goods for distribution. The failure of one or more of these suppliers
to meet the Company performance specifications, quality standards or delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Recoverability of long-lived assets
Management evaluates the carrying value of all long-lived assets to determine recoverability based on an analysis of non-discounted future cash flows. Based on its most recent analysis, management believes that no material
impairment in the value of long-lived assets exists at May31, 2000.
Recently issued accounting guidance
The FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in June 1998. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. This
statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years which begin after June 15, 2000. The statement requires entities to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure instruments
at fair value. As the Company does not have significant derivative instruments, management believes that SFAS No. 133 will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB 101. SAB 101 clarifies existing accounting principles related to revenue
recognition in financial statements. The Company is required to comply with the provisions of SAB 101 by the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ending May 31, 2001. Due to the nature of the Company operations, management does not believe that SAB 101
will have a significant impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.

ratios, as defined in the agreement, and to maintain net income annually of at least $250,000. As of May31, 2000 the Company was in violation of certain covenants. As a result of the violations, the Company and the bank, in June 2000, entered into a
forbearance agreement. This agreement requires the Company to pay additional monthly principal payments of $100,000 beginning June 15, 2000. The additional monthly principal payments increase to $125,000 beginning October 15, 2000 and to $150,000

and inventory allowances not currently deductible as expenses under IRS provisions. Although the Company recorded this allowance to the deferred tax asset, the Company may still utilize the future tax benefits from net operating losses for 15 years from
the year of the loss to the extent of future taxable income.

fiscal years. These outstanding antidilutive options for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, were 422,000, 541,750 and 4,000, respectively.

outside consultants and employee-directors. On July 29, 1996, the Board of Directors amended and stockholders subsequently approved to increase the aggregate shares issuable under the Incentive Plan to 1,000,000 from 500,000 shares.
The options granted under the Incentive Plan expire 10 years after the date of grant. The Directors' Plan, as amended in September 1999, provides that each non-employee director, upon joining the Board of Directors, will receive an option to purchase
6,000 shares of common stock. The initial option grant vests over a 3 year period, with one-third of the option grant vesting at the end of each year. At the beginning of the fourth year of service on the Board of Directors, and each year thereafter, each
nonemployee director receives an annual grant to purchase 2,000 shares of common stock. In addition, each year each non-employee director receives options to purchase 1,500 shares of common stock for serving on the following committees of the Board of
Directors for at least six months prior to the date of grant: the Audit Committee; the Compensation Committee; and the Compliance Committee. No option is exercisable sooner than 6 months and one day after the date of the grant. The options expire on the
tenth anniversary of the date of grant, 9 months after retirement or 2 years after death. Options covering 9,500, 7,000 and 4,000 shares were granted to non-employee directors during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 at $509, $850 and
$1056, respectively.

- The Company accounts for these plans under APB Opinion No. 25, under which no compensation cost has been recognized. Had compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation, the Company net loss and loss per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts for the fiscal years ended May 31 2000
- 1999

Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in pro forma net loss because compensation
costs are reflected over the option-vesting period and compensation costs for options granted prior to fiscal 1997 are not considered.
The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for fiscal 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997 grants; risk-free interest rate at the date of grant
which ranged from 56% to 67%; expected dividend yield of 00%; expected life of 5 years; and expected volatility of 4379%. 
As of May 31, 2000 a maximum of 1,075,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under these plans. None of the options can be granted at less than the fair market value of the Company stock on the date of grant.
