24          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Stockholders of StaffMark, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of StaffMark,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company, a Delaware corporation as of December 31,
1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 1999.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of StaffMark, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31,
1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. NATURE OF BUSINESS:
StaffMark, Inc. StaffMark or the Company is a global provider of
diversified staffing, information technology IT, professional, consulting
and solutions services to businesses, professional and service organizations and
governmental agencies. As of December 31, 1999, StaffMark operated over 320
offices in 32 states and 14 countries and provided staffing in the Commercial
and Professional/Information Technology Professional/IT and E-solutions
service lines. The Company extends trade credit to customers representing a
variety of industries. There are no individual customers that accounted for more
than 5% of the Company service revenues in any of the periods presented.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of StaffMark, Inc.
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers cash on deposit with financial institutions and all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.
Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
are as follows   Furniture, fixtures and equipment      5-7 years
Computer equipment and software       5-7 years
Leasehold improvements           3-15 years
Additions that extend the lives of the assets are capitalized while repairs
and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. When property and equipment are
retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are
removed from the balance sheet and any resultant gain or loss is recorded.
Intangible Assets  Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, which is generally amortized
over 30 years using the straight-line method. Deferred financing costs are
amortized over the life of the respective debt obligation using a method which
approximates the effective interest method. Intangibles associated with non-
compete agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over the life of
the respective agreements.
In conjunction with management restructuring plan described more fully in
Note 4, in January 2000, management decided to operate its E-solutions
business unit as a distinct operating unit as opposed to an integrated component
of the Professional/IT segment, as had been originally planned. As a result of
this change in operating strategy, management is currently reevaluating its
estimated useful life for the intangibles associated with their acquisition of
Edgewater Technology, Inc. Edgewater. Prior to the restructure and
segmentation, these intangibles were amortized over 30 years since Edgewater was
operated as an integral component of the Professional/IT segment. Management has
engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist them in determining the
appropriate useful life for these intangible assets. The change in useful life
will be made effective January 1, 2000 and is expected to result in a material
increase in the annual amortization expense over that which would have been
recorded based on the previous 30 year life.
30 Workers' Compensation  StaffMark self-insures certain risks related to workers' compensation claims.
The estimated costs of existing and future claims are accrued as incidents occur
based upon historical loss development trends and may be subsequently revised
based on developments relating to such claims. StaffMark has engaged the
services of a third-party actuary to assist with the development of these cost
estimates.
Revenue Recognition  Service revenues are recognized as income at the time staffing services are
provided.
Income Taxes  Income taxes have been provided based upon the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires recognition of deferred income taxes using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes result from the effect of transactions which are
recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting purposes.
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of such temporary
differences by applying currently enacted statutory tax rates to differences
between the financial reporting and the tax bases of existing assets and
liabilities.
Foreign Currency Translation  The functional currency for certain of the Company foreign subsidiaries is
their local currency. The translation from the foreign currency to U.S. dollars
is performed for balance sheet accounts using the exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date and for income statement accounts using a weighted-average
exchange rate during the period. The gains or losses resulting from such
translations are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
stockholders' equity.
Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company policy is to use financial derivatives only to manage exposure
to fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. Gains and
losses realized and premiums paid on interest rate hedges and foreign currency
options are deferred and amortized to expense over the life of the underlying
hedged instrument, or immediately if the underlying hedged instrument is
settled.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  StaffMark financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and its
debt obligations. Management believes that these financial instruments bear
interest at rates which approximate prevailing market rates for instruments with
similar characteristics and, accordingly, that the carrying values for these
instruments are reasonable estimates of fair value.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  StaffMark regularly evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred
which may indicate that the carrying amount of intangible or other long-lived
assets warrant revision or may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that an
asset or assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, an evaluation is
performed pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. If
an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows
associated with the asset are compared to the asset carrying amount to
determine if a write-down to market value or discounted cash flow value is
required. During 1998, the Company recognized an impairment in the goodwill
associated with its physical/occupational therapy staffing unit as more fully
described in Note 4.
31 Stock Options  During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which encourages all companies
to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value, at grant date, of
instruments issued pursuant to stock-based compensation plans. SFAS No. 123
requires the fair value of the instruments granted, which is measured pursuant
to the provisions of the statement, to be recognized as compensation expense
over the vesting period of the instrument. However, the statement also allows
companies to continue to measure compensation costs for these instruments using
the method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25 APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Companies
electing to account for stock-based compensation plans pursuant to the
provisions of APB No. 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income as if the
fair value method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. StaffMark has
elected to account for stock options under the provisions of APB No. 25 and has
included the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123 in Note 13.
Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions
used in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements are based
upon management evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the
date of the financial statements. However, actual results may differ from the
estimates and assumptions used in preparing these consolidated financial
statements.
Other Comprehensive Income  The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, in its financial statements for all periods presented.
Other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation gains and
losses and has been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
stockholders' equity.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The FASB recently issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities - Deferral of Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133.
SFAS No. 137 defers for one year the effective date of SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and for Hedging Activities. As a result, SFAS No.
133 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No.
133 was issued to establish accounting and reporting standards requiring that
every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset
or liability measured at fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in a
derivative fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges
allows a derivative gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged
item in the income statement and requires that a company must formally document,
designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge
accounting. StaffMark has not yet quantified the impacts of adopting SFAS No.
133 on its financial statements; however, SFAS No. 133 could increase the
volatility of reported earnings and other comprehensive income once adopted.
Classification of Prior Year Balances  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances in order to
conform with the current year presentation.
3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:
The operating results of all acquisitions accounted for under the purchase
method have been included since the effective date of acquisition. The costs of
these acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair market values of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any excess costs over fair
values of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been restated for significant pooling-of-
interests business combinations. All significant intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

acquisition agreements include provisions for the payment of additional
consideration, which is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance
measures of the businesses acquired. During 1999, the Company paid consideration
totaling $366 million in cash and 5,000 shares of common stock pursuant to
these arrangements. During 1998, the Company paid consideration totaling $369
million in cash and 169,434 shares of common stock pursuant to these
arrangements. In 1999, the Company also cancelled 35,986 shares that had been
put in escrow for certain companies acquired during 1998. As of December 31,
1998, the Company had accrued approximately $316 million related to these
arrangements. These amounts have been reported as other long-term liabilities in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Any additional consideration to be
paid for acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 1999 will be immaterial to
the accompanying financial statements.
On November 25, 1998, StaffMark completed its merger with Robert Walters plc
Robert Walters. In connection with the merger, each outstanding share of
Robert Walters common stock was converted into the right to receive 0272 shares
of the Company common stock, totaling 6,687,704 common shares in the
aggregate. The merger has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
restated to include the accounts of Robert Walters for all periods presented.
Pro Forma Operating Results   In addition to Robert Walters, the Company acquired 17 staffing and
professional service companies during 1998. The 1998 acquisitions of Strategic
Legal Resources, Inc., Progressive Personnel Resources, Inc. and WorldTec Group
International, Inc. were considered significant. These 1998 acquisitions are
referred to as the Acquisitions. The unaudited consolidated results of
operations on a pro forma basis as though the Acquisitions had been acquired as
of the beginning of 1998 are presented below. The pro forma information
presented below does not reflect the reductions in salaries that certain owners
of the Acquisitions agreed to in connection with their acquisition. The
remaining 1998 and 1999 acquisitions were not significant, individually or in
the aggregate, and, therefore, have not been included in the following pro forma
presentation.                     Fiscal Years

4.  NON-RECURRING MERGER AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES AND PROVISIONS TO REDUCE THE
CARRYING VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS:
During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded merger and
integration expenses totaling approximately $246 million related to the merger
with Robert Walters and other pooling-of-interests transactions completed during
1998. Included in these costs were approximately $133 million for professional
and financial advisors' fees, approximately $108 million related to integration
expenses and approximately $500,000 for severance and employee-related expenses.
Integration expenses consisted primarily of costs related to office closings and
contract terminations pursuant to management plan of integration, which was
completed by September 30, 1999. Substantially all costs associated with
severance had been incurred as of December 31, 1998.
33  Upon completion of management plan of integration, approximately $828,000,
representing an overaccrual of merger and integration expenses relating to the
merger with Robert Walters, was reversed into income during September 1999. The
following is a summary of the Company merger and integration accrual                        In Thousands

In 1998, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $14 million to write down
the carrying value of goodwill due to its plan to discontinue or dispose of its
physical/occupational therapy staffing unit. In conjunction with renegotiating
its credit facility, the Company also recorded a non-cash charge of $13 million
to write-off deferred financing costs related to its previously outstanding
debt.
During the third quarter of 1999, the Company recorded restructuring expenses
totaling approximately $30 million relating to the restructure of the Company
Professional/IT segment. This charge arose from management decision, during
the third quarter of 1999, to redesign their sales strategy and resulting
management organization. Management plan, which is expected to be completed
during the first quarter of 2000, is to separate their sales and management
functions between the IT staffing and end-user solutions services. As a result
of this plan, approximately 80 employees were severed or reassigned in the
restructuring process, which also involved the hiring of about 25 new IT
salespeople, service specialists and managers. Additionally, the Company IT
platform in the Professional/IT segment closed 12 offices and implemented a
satellite branch structure to serve certain markets where a full branch office
was not required. The Company also implemented a new front-end system throughout
the domestic IT offices which altered branch staff requirements and reduced the
need for certain positions. As a result of the above, expenses of approximately
$22 million for severance costs, approximately $280,000 for office closing
costs, and approximately $457,000 for other costs including legal and travel
expenses have been recorded. The total expenses of approximately $30 million
were partially offset by the reversal of the Robert Walters merger and
integration accrual of approximately $828,000 discussed above. In addition to
costs that have been incurred, the restructuring expense also includes future
contractual obligations to certain severed employees which extend through
September 2001. The following is a summary of the Company restructuring
accrual, which has been included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet                          In Thousands

Included in accounts receivable are unbilled amounts totaling approximately
$296 million and $187 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
StaffMark maintains allowances for potential losses which management believes
are adequate to absorb losses to be incurred in realizing the amounts recorded
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

8.  DEBT:
The Company has a credit facility the Credit Facility with a consortium
of banks used for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
including acquisitions. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, maximum borrowings
pursuant to the Credit Facility were limited to approximately $3250 million and
$2500 million, respectively. Additionally, during December 1999, the Company
obtained a commitment from two members of its Credit Facility to increase its
borrowing capacity for an additional $100 million through January 2000. These
increased borrowings were not utilized by the Company. On March 31, 2000, the
maximum amount of borrowings under the Credit Facility is scheduled to revert
back to $300 million. The remaining $300 million of the Credit Facility matures
on August 20, 2003. Interest on any borrowings is computed using the Company
option of either the bank group prime rate or the London interbank offered
rate, incrementally adjusted based on the Company operating leverage ratios.
As of December 31, 1999, the Company is required to pay a quarterly facility fee
determined by multiplying the total amount of the Credit Facility by a
percentage which varies based on the Company operating leverage ratios. As of
December 31, 1999, this fee was 025% of the total amount of the Credit
Facility. As of December 31, 1998, the Company was required to pay quarterly
commitment fees equal to 020%-025% of the unused portion
35 of the total revolving credit commitment.
The Credit Facility requires compliance with certain financial ratios and
other operational covenants. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at
December 31, 1999. The Credit Facility is secured by all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company first tier foreign
subsidiaries. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, debt outstanding under the
Credit Facility consisted of the following                                   1999     1998

respectively. Matures on August 20, 2003.         $300,414  $176,700
9.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:
The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements during 1998. Under the
terms of these agreements, the Company is obligated to pay interest on a
notional amount to the extent that the fixed rate under the interest rate swap
agreements exceeds the LIBOR rate, as measured pursuant to the agreements.
Furthermore, the Company will receive interest to the extent that the LIBOR rate
exceeds the aforementioned fixed rate. Interest received as a result of these
agreements has been netted against interest expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. The amounts related to the interest rate swap
agreements as of and for the year ended December 31, 1999 were as follows        Notional Fixed LIBOR Interest Estimated
Amount  Rate  Rate  Revenue  Fair Value Maturity

20,000  4835% 6125%    71     285 November 2000  The Company involvement with derivative financial instruments is limited to
the interest rate swap agreements discussed above. The Company entered into
these agreements as hedges against increases in interest rates which would
increase the cost of its variable rate borrowings under the Credit Facility.
Conversely, the Company is exposed to the risk that the cost of those borrowings
would be higher than the amount computed under the Credit Facility should
interest rates decline. In addition, the Company is exposed to credit risk in
the event of non-performance by the bank facilitating these agreements but has
no off-balance-sheet risk of accounting loss related to these agreements.

A valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets has not been recorded in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because management believes that
all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recovered. In assessing
the realizability of deferred income tax assets, management has considered
scheduled reversals of the deferred income tax liabilities and projected future
taxable income.

StaffMark is self-insured for certain workers' compensation claims and is
regulated by various state-administered workers' compensation insurance
commissions. StaffMark has purchased insurance for claims which exceed certain
thresholds and is required in certain states to maintain letters of credit to
cover any potential unpaid claims. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, these letters
of credit totaled approximately $63 million and $52 million, respectively.
12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:
The Company maintains several defined contribution employee benefit plans,
some of which allow eligible employees to defer a portion of their income
through contributions to the plans. Contributions by StaffMark to the various
plans were approximately $16 million, $12 million and $03 million for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
In May 1997, the Company shareholders approved an employee stock purchase
plan the Stock Purchase Plan which grants employees the right to purchase
shares of the Company common stock at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the
market value on the date of purchase or the beginning of the calendar quarter of
the purchase. Purchases under the Stock Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the
respective employees' compensation and do not impact the Company reported net
income.
13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS:
Common Stock   The Company stockholders had authorized 200 million shares of common stock
and 10 million shares of preferred stock for issuance as of December 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively. Common shares outstanding as of December 31, 1997
include 7,895,699 shares which represent the equivalent common shares issued for
pooling-of-interests business combinations that were completed during 1998.
On August 26, 1997, the Company completed a common stock offering which
involved the public sale of 3,950,000 shares including underwriters' over-
allotment of common stock. Approximately 285,000 of these shares were sold by
certain stockholders of the Company the Selling Stockholders. The Company
did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of these shares by the Selling
Stockholders. Additionally, Robert Walters issued 348,160 equivalent StaffMark
shares in conjunction with a public sale of common stock during 1997.
Dividends   During the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, Robert Walters made
distributions to its shareholders prior to the merger totaling $07 million and
$16 million, respectively. StaffMark has not historically paid any dividends on
its common stock and intends to continue this practice for the foreseeable
future.
Stock Options   In October 1999, StaffMark Board of Directors amended StaffMark 1996
Stock Option Plan the Plan to increase the maximum number of shares of
StaffMark common stock that may be issued under the Plan from 12% to 15% of
the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. Options granted under
the Plan generally become 40% vested after two years and then vest 20% in each
of the next three years. Under the Plan, the exercise price of the option equals
the market value of StaffMark common stock on the date of the grant, and the
maximum term for each option is 10 years.
Robert Walters maintained three stock option plans for its employees, all of
which required compensatory accounting treatment under APB No. 25. Total
compensation income/expense recognized related to Robert Walters stock option
plans was $07 million and $46 million for the years ended December 31, 1998
and 1997, respectively. These amounts have been included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income
and reflected as adjustments to paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated
statements of stockholders' equity.
38  Robert Walters options became fully vested on the effective date of the
merger and 245,903 equivalent StaffMark options had been exercised as of
December 31, 1999. A summary of StaffMark stock option activity is as follows                           Weighted

As discussed in Note 2, StaffMark has elected to account for its stock
options under the provisions of APB No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation expense
has been recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income other
than the compensation income/expense recognized related to Robert Walters
stock option plans for the periods prior to the merger discussed above. Pursuant
to the requirements of SFAS No. 123, the following disclosures are presented to
reflect StaffMark pro forma net income for the years ended December 31, 1999,
1998 and 1997, as if the fair value method of accounting prescribed by SFAS No.
123 had been used. In preparing the pro forma disclosures, the fair value was
estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. These
fair value calculations were based on the following assumptions                             Fiscal Years
1999   1998   1997
Weighted average risk-free interest rate    634%   455%   525%
Dividend yield                  0%    0%    0%
Weighted average expected life       5 years  5 years  5 years
Expected volatility               80%    58%    51  Using these assumptions, the fair value of the noncompensatory stock options
granted during the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was
approximately $87 million, $120 million and $95 million, respectively. The
weighted average fair value per share of noncompensatory options granted during
1999, 1998 and 1997 was $564, $1460 and $1097, respectively. Had compensation
expense been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, utilizing the assumptions
above and the straight-line amortization method over the vesting period, net
income would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts                    39                           Fiscal Years

14. EARNINGS PER SHARE:
In accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, basic earnings per
share is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares
outstanding during each year. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur assuming the exercise of all outstanding stock options
having exercise prices less than the average market price of the Company
common shares. A reconciliation of net income and weighted average shares used
in computing basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows                             1999     1998    1997

Basic earnings per share of common stock      $ 103   $ 065   $ 085
Diluted earnings per share:
Net income applicable to common shares       $30,213   $18,639   $20,400

Options to purchase approximately 21 million shares of common stock at
prices ranging from $1138 to $4075 per share were outstanding during 1999 but
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the
Company common shares. These options, which expire ten years from the date of
issue, were still outstanding as of December 31, 1999. Options to purchase
316,850 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $29125 to $40750 per
share were outstanding during 1998 but were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average
market price of the Company common shares.
40 15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:
StaffMark has entered into agreements with certain stockholders, officers and
employees of the Company to lease certain parcels of land and buildings used in
the Company operations. Rent expense related to these facilities totaled
approximately $551,000, $609,000 and $644,000 for the years ended December 31,
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Annual future minimum payments required under
these leases are included in the table in Note 17 and are summarized as follows        Fiscal Years      Amount

Included in other current assets as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 are
advances to certain officers and employees totaling $457,000 and $460,000,
respectively. Also included in other current assets as of December 31, 1999 and
1998 is a note receivable from a stockholder totaling $1,000,000 which bears
interest at 65% and is payable in annual installments through maturity on
February 28, 2002.
16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
From March 12, 1999 through April 22, 1999, several stockholders filed
complaints against the Company seeking unspecified compensatory and other
damages by alleging that the Company violated the federal securities laws
relating to an announcement by the Company on March 2, 1999. All of the
complaints have been consolidated into an amended complaint that was filed in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas on January
11, 2000. Although the outcome is uncertain, the Company believes that these
complaints are without merit and denies all of the allegations of wrongdoing and
are vigorously defending the suits. Accordingly, no provisions have been made in
the accompanying financial statements related to this matter.
StaffMark is subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal
course of business, primarily relating to workers' compensation and other
employee related matters. StaffMark maintains various insurance coverages in
order to minimize the financial risk associated with certain of these claims.
StaffMark has employment agreements with certain executive officers and
management personnel that provide for annual salaries, cost-of-living
adjustments and additional compensation in the form of performance-based
bonuses. Certain agreements include covenants against competition with
StaffMark, which extend for a period of time after termination. These agreements
generally continue until terminated by the employee or StaffMark.
17. NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES:
StaffMark leases office space and certain equipment under noncancelable
operating leases. As discussed in Note 15, certain of these facilities are
leased from related parties. Annual future minimum payments required under
operating leases that have an initial or remaining noncancelable lease term in
excess of one year are as follows        Fiscal Years      Amount

Rent expense, including amounts paid to related parties, was approximately
$136 million, $111 million and $49 million for
41 the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
18. SEGMENT INFORMATION:
In 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, which requires reporting segment
information consistent with the way management internally disaggregates an
entity operations to assess performance and to allocate resources. The Company
has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 131 for the year ended December 31, 1999
and has also presented below the required segment information for the years
ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.
As a result of management restructuring plan in late 1999, as discussed in
Note 4, management determined that its E-solutions business was fundamentally
different than the other components of its Professional/IT segment and began
managing the E-solutions segment as an autonomous business unit beginning in
2000. Accordingly, in January 2000, management began disaggregating the results
of the Company E-solutions business unit and reviewing those results
separately. These operations had previously been included in the Company
Professional/IT segment.
StaffMark segments its operations based upon differences in services
provided. The Company Commercial segment provides clerical and light
industrial staffing services in the United States. The Company Professional/IT
segment provides staffing, consulting, technical and support services primarily
in the areas of finance, accounting, information technology and legal services
in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and ten other foreign
countries. The Company E-solutions segment provides e-commerce software
solutions, consulting and development services. The corporate column includes
general corporate expenses, headquarters facilities and equipment, internal-use
software, and other non-recurring expenses not allocated to the segments.
The accounting policies used in measuring segment assets and operating
results are the same as those described in Note 2. The Company evaluates
performance of the segments based on segment operating income, excluding
corporate overhead, non-recurring and unusual items. The Company does not have
any significant intersegment sales or transfers.
The results of the Company business segments as of and for the years ending
December 31 are as follows                  Professional/
