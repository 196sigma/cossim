38              SPECTRX, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1996 AND 1997
1.  ORGANIZATION AND BACKGROUND
SpectRx, Inc. and subsidiary the Company is engaged in the research and
development of products that offer less invasive and painless alternatives
to blood tests currently used for glucose monitoring, diabetes screening,
and infant jaundice. The Company goal is to introduce products that
reduce or eliminate pain, are convenient to use, and provide rapid results
at the point of care, thereby improving patient well-being and reducing
healthcare costs. The Company glucose monitoring, diabetes screening, and
infant jaundice products are based on proprietary electro-optical and
microporation technology that can eliminate the pain and inconvenience of a
blood sample. The Company has entered into collaborative arrangements with
Abbott Laboratories Abbott, Boehringer Mannheim Corporation
Boehringer Mannheim and Healthdyne Technologies, Inc. Healthdyne to
facilitate the development, commercialization, and introduction of its
glucose monitoring, diabetes screening, and infant jaundice products,
respectively.
The developmental nature of the Company activities is such that inherent
risks exist in its operations. The Company is subject to a number of risks,
including successful product development, dependence on licensed patent
applications and proprietary technology, completion of regulatory
approvals, a market for its products, competition from well-established
larger companies and potential competition from other noninvasive products,
the potential need for additional financing, a lack of sales experience,
product liability, and dependence on key personnel. While management
believes that the Company will be successful, there are no assurances of
successful future operations.
In July 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering the
Offering of its common stock Note 5. In connection with the Offering,
the board of directors approved a reverse stock split of 1-for-14 for the
Company common stock effective February 19, 1997. Accordingly, all share,
per share, weighted average share, stock option, and common stock warrant
information have been restated to reflect the split. The reverse stock
split had no effect upon the number of shares of preferred stock issued and
outstanding, just the number of shares of common stock into which the
preferred stock converted.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
SpectRx, Inc. SpectRx and, since December 5, 1996, its majority owned
subsidiary FluorRx, Inc. FluorRx Note 3. All significant intercompany
amounts have been eliminated.
PRESENTATION
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.                    -38  39
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of five to seven
years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Property and equipment are summarized as follows at December 31, 1996 and
1997 in thousands                       1996    1997
Equipment                 $ 689   $1,181
Furniture and fixtures            181    256
870   1,437
Less accumulated depreciation         274    507
Property and equipment, net   $ 596   $ 930
OTHER ASSETS
Other assets include net purchased technology of $118,000 and $70,000 at
December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively, which is being amortized using
the straight-line method over its estimated useful life of five years.
PATENT COSTS
Costs incurred in filing, prosecuting, and maintaining patents are expensed
as incurred. Such costs aggregated approximately $71,000, $165,000, and
$286,000 in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from collaborative research and development agreements is recorded
when earned. Periodic license fee payments under collaborative agreements
related to future performance are deferred and recognized as income when
earned.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development expenses consist of expenditures for research
conducted by the Company and payments made under contracts with consultants
or other outside parties. All research and development costs are expensed
as incurred.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 128,
Earnings Per Share, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15,
1997. The Company adopted the new guidelines for the calculation and
presentation of earnings per share and all prior periods have been
restated. Basic earnings per share is based upon the weighted average
number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based upon the
weighted average number of shares outstanding and the dilutive effect of
common stock equivalent shares CSEs issuable upon the conversion of
convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method and stock
options and warrants using the treasury stock method.
-39-
40
Pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No. 83, common stock, and CSEs issued at prices below the
public offering price during the 12-month period prior to the Offering were
included in the calculation as if they were outstanding for all periods
presented, regardless of whether they are dilutive. In February 1998, SEC
staff released SAB No. 98 on computations of earnings per share. SAB No. 98
replaces SAB No. 83 in its entirety and requires, among other items, that
only nominal issuances of common stock be reflected in the calculation as
if they were outstanding for all periods presented and that the calculation
be made in accordance with Statement No. 128 for periods subsequent to the
Offering. Accordingly, for all periods presented, common stock equivalents
have been excluded from diluted weighted average shares outstanding as
their impact was antidilutive.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The book values of cash, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable,
and other financial instruments approximate their fair values principally
because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value
of the Company long-term debt is estimated based on the current rates
offered to the Company for debt of similar terms and maturities. Under this
method, the fair value of the Company long-term debt was not
significantly different than the stated value at December 31, 1997.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company periodically reviews the values assigned to long-lived assets,
such as property and equipment and purchased technology, to determine
whether any impairments are other than temporary. Management believes that
the long-lived assets in the accompanying balance sheets are appropriately
valued.
3.  INVESTMENT IN FLUORRX, INC.
In December 1996, the Company sublicensed certain technology to and
acquired a 65% interest in FluorRx, a newly organized Delaware corporation
formed for the purpose of developing and commercializing technology related
to fluorescence spectroscopy. The Company interest is represented by two
seats on FluorRx board of directors and 129,000 shares of FluorRx
Series A convertible preferred stock purchased for $250,000. As discussed
below in December 1997, FluorRx issued 23,000 shares of mandatory
redeemable convertible preferred stock, which if converted to common stock,
would reduce the Company ownership percentage in FluorRx to 57%.
FluorRx has authorized 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value
of $01 per share, of which 300,000 shares were authorized as Series A
preferred stock Series A Preferred and 300,000 as Series B preferred
stock Series B Preferred. All outstanding Series A Preferred is owned
by SpectRx and has been eliminated in consolidation. FluorRx Series A and
B Preferred is convertible at a ratio one to one subject to adjustment
into FluorRx common stock. The Series B Preferred may be converted at the
option of the holder at any time after issuance and is automatically
converted into common stock upon the occurrence of certain defined events.
The holders of the Series B Preferred are entitled to annual cumulative
dividends, payable when declared, at a rate of 8% per share. In addition,
the holders of Series B Preferred have liquidation preference of $2594 per
share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends. The Series B Preferred is
redeemable at the shareholders option after December 2002, at a price of
$2594, plus accrued but unpaid dividends or, fair market value, as
defined, as of the date of the request for redemption.
In December 1997, FluorRx sold 23,000 shares of Series B Preferred at a
price of $2594 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $597,000 with
net cash proceeds to FluorRx of $521,000. In connection with the issuance
of the Series B Preferred, FluorRx issued the selling agent a warrant to
purchase 2,300 shares of FluorRx common stock. The warrant was valued at
$19,000 and was accounted for as additional issuance costs.
For the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, FluorRx incurred operating
losses of $58,000 and $632,000. Due to the Company effective control of
FluorRx, the Company has fully consolidated these losses.                    -40  41
4.  CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED PROMISSORY NOTES
In November 1995 and April 1996, the Company issued 10% convertible
subordinated promissory notes for $500,000 and $982,000, respectively.
Pursuant to the terms of these notes, all outstanding principal and accrued
interest were converted in August 1996 into 389,951 shares of Series B
convertible preferred stock. Warrants to purchase 107,143 and 210,470
shares of common stock were issued with the promissory notes in
consideration for additional proceeds of $5,000 and $18,000, respectively,
in November 1995 and April 1996, respectively Note 6. The value of the
warrants issued in November 1995 and April 1996 was determined to be
$35,000 and $59,000, respectively, based on the difference between the
stated interest rate and the Company estimated effective borrowing rate
for the terms of the notes. The noncash allocation to the warrants of
$30,000 and $41,000 in November 1995 and April 1996, respectively, was
accounted for as a debt discount. The unamortized debt discount was
expensed as additional interest expense upon the conversion of the notes in
August 1996.
In June 1996, the Company issued an 8% convertible subordinated promissory
note for $250,000. Principal and interest are payable June 1998. The holder
of the note may convert outstanding principal and interest into common
stock at a conversion rate of $350 per share.
5. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
In July 1997, the Company successfully completed its initial public
offering of common stock. The Company sold 2,160,000 shares of common
stock, including an underwriters over-allotment of 160,000 shares, at an
initial public offering price of $7. The total proceeds of the initial
public offering, net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were
approximately $132 million. In connection with the offering, all
outstanding shares of Series A, B, and C preferred stock converted into
3,482,762 shares of common stock. Additionally, warrants to purchase
559,986 shares of common stock were exercised for proceeds of $694,000.
PREFERRED STOCK
In January 1997, the Company authorized 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, with a $001 par value. The board of directors has the authority to
issue these shares and to fix dividends, voting and conversion rights,
redemption provisions, liquidation preferences, and other rights and
restrictions.
STOCK OPTIONS
In May 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Stock Option Plan as amended,
the Plan, under which 1,428,572 shares of common stock are authorized
and reserved for use in the Plan. The Plan allows the issuance of incentive
stock options, nonqualified stock options, and stock purchase rights. The
exercise price of options is determined by the Company board of
directors, but incentive stock options must be granted at an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of the Company common stock as of the
grant date. Options generally become exercisable over four years and expire
ten years from the date of grant. At December 31, 1997, options to purchase
352,464 shares of common stock were available for future grant under the
Plan.

In June 1996, November 1996, and December 1996, the Company granted options
to purchase 269,652, 8,573, and 60,715, respectively, shares of common
stock at exercise prices of $70, $245, and $245 per share, respectively.
In connection with the issuance of these options, the Company recognized
$304,000 as deferred compensation for the excess of the deemed value for
accounting purposes of the common stock issuable upon exercise of such
options over the aggregate exercise price of such options. This deferred
compensation is amortized ratably over the vesting period of the options.
The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plan
under APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees; however, the
Company has computed for pro forma disclosure purposes the value of all
options granted in each of the three years ended December 31, 1997 using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and using the following weighted
average assumptions used for grants in 1995, 1996, and 1997                1995    1996    1997

Expected volatility      900%   900%   580   The total values of the options granted during the years ended December 31,
1995, 1996, and 1997 were computed as approximately $46,000, $511,000, and
$1,587,000, respectively, which would be amortized over the vesting period
of the options. If the Company had accounted for these plans in accordance
with SFAS No. 123, the                    -42  43
Company reported net loss and net loss per share for each of the three

In connection with the November 1995 and April 1996 note sales Note 4,
the Company issued warrants to purchase 317,613 shares of common stock at
an exercise price per share of 20% of the price per share paid in the next
equity financing of $5,000,000 or more, inclusive of the notes and warrants
subject to conversion. In August 1996, the exercise price was set at $112
per share.
Upon the close of the Offering, all outstanding warrants to purchase
559,986 shares of common stock were exercised providing proceeds of
approximately $694,000.
Under the terms of a certain license and technology agreement Note 9, the
Company issued a right to Altea Technologies, Inc. Altea to obtain a
warrant for the purchase of up to 588,572 shares of common stock at $21
per share. Upon a liquidity event for which the Offering qualified, as
defined, Altea had the option to sell all rights to the licensed technology
in exchange for a warrant to purchase up to 588,572 shares of common stock,
depending on the achievement of certain milestones with respect to the
licensed technology. Altea did not elect to exercise its right to obtain
the warrant, and the Company will continue with the existing license and
technology agreement.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In connection with the Offering, the Company adopted an employee stock
purchase plan under which the Company may issue up 214,286 shares of common
stock. Eligible employees may use up to 10% of their compensation to
purchase, through payroll deductions, the Company common stock at the end
of each plan period for 85% of the lower of the beginning or ending stock
price in the plan period. During 1997, the Company issued 3,387 shares of
common stock at a price of $595 per share.
6.  INCOME TAXES
The Company has incurred net operating losses since inception. As of
December 31, 1997, the Company had net operating loss NOL carryforwards
of approximately $11,660,000 available to offset its future income tax
liability. The NOL carryforwards begin to expire in the year 2007. The
Company has recorded a valuation allowance for all NOL carryforwards.
Utilization of existing NOL carryforwards may be limited in future years,
if significant ownership changes have occurred.

operating leases for office space and equipment are as follows                                 
1998                $201,000

2000                136,000
2001                 24,000   Rental expense was $49,000, $92,000, and $215,000 in 1995, 1996, and 1997,
respectively.
In the past, the Company has been subject to certain asserted and
unasserted claims against certain intellectual property rights owned and
licensed by the Company. A successful claim against intellectual property
rights owned or licensed by the Company could subject the Company to
significant liabilities to third parties, require the Company to seek
licenses from third parties, or prevent the Company from selling its
products in certain markets or at all. In the opinion of management, there
are no known claims against the Company owned or licensed intellectual
property rights that will have a material adverse impact on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
8.  RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In connection with a June 1994 sale of restricted stock, the Company loaned
two officers of the Company $48,525. These loans were secured by common
stock of the Company held by the officers, bear interest at 6% per annum,
and become payable on June 30, 1999.
In March 1996, the Company issued 28,572 shares of common stock to Laser
Atlanta Optics, Inc. LAO in settlement of a dispute. The Company and
LAO are related through a common group of shareholders. The shares were
valued at $14,000, which was expensed upon issuance. In September 1996, the
Company loaned LAO $30,000, which was repaid in December 1996.
In March 1996, the Company entered into a license and joint development
agreement with Altea, a company equally owned by Jonathan Eppstein, an
officer and principal stockholder of the Company, and his sister Note 9.
On March 8, 1996, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company
received certain rights to technology useful in glucose monitoring, issued
71,429 shares of common stock, which were valued at $35,000, and made cash
payments totaling $25,000 for the rights to the technology. The Company
paid royalties to Altea totaling $273,000 and $100,000 during 1996 and
1997, respectively.
In October 1996, the Company loaned two officers a total of $400,000. The
loans are secured by common stock of the Company and common stock of LAO
held by the officers. The loans bear interest at 672% per annum and are
due and payable in cash in October 2001.
In October 1996, the Company entered into a research and development and
license agreement the Abbott Agreement with Abbott for the development
and commercialization of the Company glucose monitoring product Note
10. Under the Abbott Agreement, the Company receives payments on
achievement of milestones                    -44  45
and a royalty on Abbott product sales for which the Company recorded
revenues of $500,000 during 1997. The Abbott Agreement also requires Abbott
to reimburse certain direct expenses incurred by the Company in connection
with the development of the glucose monitoring products. Reimbursed
expenses of $0, $490,000, and $1,788,000 for the years ended December 31,
1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively, have been netted with research and
development expenses in the accompanying statements of operations. In
connection with the Abbott Agreement, Abbott purchased $3 million of Series
C preferred stock.
A portion of the proceeds from the Company sale of convertible
subordinated promissory notes and Series A and B preferred stock were
received from officers, directors, or other parties related to the Company
as a result of previous equity transactions. The sales were conducted
concurrently with and on the same terms as those entered into with
unrelated parties.
9.  LICENSE AND TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENTS
As part of the Company efforts to conduct research and development
activities and to commercialize potential products, the Company, from time
to time, enters into agreements with certain organizations and individuals
that further those efforts but also obligate the Company to make future
minimum payments or to remit royalties ranging from 1% to 3% of revenue
from sale of commercial products developed from the research.
The Company generally has the option not to make required minimum royalty
payments, in which case the Company loses the exclusive license to develop
applicable technology. Minimum required payments to maintain exclusive
rights to licensed technology are as follows at December 31, 1997                                 
1998               $  410,000
1999                 510,000
2000                 760,000
2001                1,110,000
2002                1,360,000   No royalty payments were made during 1995. During 1996, the Company paid
$273,000 in royalties in connection with the sale of the Series C preferred
stock, of which $50,000 was expensed as required minimum payments and
