Notes to Consolidated Financial  - 41        Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants
To the Stockholders
General Bearing Corporation
West Nyack, New York
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Bearing
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 30, 2000 and January 1, 2000, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2000. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the companies' management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Rockland Manufacturing
Company and WMW Machinery Company, Inc., wholly owned subsidiaries whose
statements collectively reflect assets of 95% and 122% in the consolidated
balance sheets presented as of December 30, 2000 and January 1, 2000, and
revenues of 128%, 134% and 214% of the related consolidated totals, for each
of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2000, respectively. Those
statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us,
and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Rockland
Manufacturing Company and WMW Machinery Company, Inc. is based solely on the
report of the other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of
other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of General Bearing Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 30, 2000 and January 1, 2000, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 30, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of General, its wholly owned
subsidiaries and all joint ventures in which General maintains
control and has at least a 50% ownership share. Investments in other
joint ventures are carried under the equity method. The years ended
December 30, 2000, January 1, 2000 and January 2, 1999 are referred
to as fiscal 2000, fiscal 1999, and fiscal 1998, respectively.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
Adoption of Recent Accounting Principles: The consolidated financial
statements reflect, for all periods presented, the adoption of the
classification requirements pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs,
EITF 00-14, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives, and EITF 00-22,
Accounting for Points and Certain Other Time Based or Volume Based
Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products to be Delivered
in the Future, which were effective in the Company fourth quarter
of 2000. The Company reclassified to Net sales income from freight
charged to customers, and the cost of rebates provided to customers
pursuant to promotional incentive programs, which were historically
included in Selling, general and administrative expenses for all
periods presented.                    F-22                   General Bearing Corporation and Subsidiaries
Note 1.   The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
Continued
Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all investments in highly
liquid debt instruments with maturities of three months or less from
date of purchase and money market funds to be cash equivalents.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in,
first-out method or market.
During fiscal 1999, Rockland negotiated revised terms under which it
purchases inventory. Rockland maintains the right to return all
unsold inventory and is obligated to remit payment for inventory
only upon sale. Accordingly, the Company treats these materials to
be inventory held on consignment and has not recorded them in
inventory at December 30, 2000 and January 1, 2000. Inventory at
December 30, 2000 and January 1, 2000 consists of approximately
$850,000 and $691,000, respectively, of inventory acquired under the
previously existing purchasing arrangement and inventory held for
rework and costs related to consigned goods. Inventory held on
consignment approximated $3,450,000 and $4,165,000 at December 30,
2000 and January 1, 2000, respectively.
Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting
principles are excluded from net income, as these amounts are
recorded directly as an adjustment to shareholders' equity. The
Company comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments. The comprehensive income for each of the
three years in the period ended December 30, 2000 is presented in
the Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity.
Fixed Assets: The cost of depreciable plant and equipment is
depreciated for financial reporting purposes over the estimated
useful lives using the straight-line or declining balance methods.
The estimated lives for each property classification are as follows       
Land and buildings      No depreciation - land, 10-40 years
- building
Machinery and equipment   3 to 10 years
Furniture and fixtures    10 years
Transportation equipment   3 to 5 years
Leasehold improvements    Lesser of life of lease or useful life
Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals or
betterments are charged against income. Major renewals and
replacements are capitalized.
Evaluating Recoverability of Long Lived Assets: The Company reviews
the carrying values of its long-lived and identifiable intangible
assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may
not be recoverable. The Company assesses recoverability of these
assets by estimating future nondiscounted cash flows. Any long-lived
assets held for disposal are reported at the lower of their carrying
amounts or fair value less cost to sell. During 2000, the Company
recorded an impairment write-down of $501,000 see Note 18.
Fiscal Year: The reporting period for the Company is a 52-53 week
fiscal year. There were 52 weeks in the periods ended December 30,
2000 and January 1, 2000, and 53 weeks in the period ended January
2, 1999.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue when products
are shipped. The Company provides, as a reduction in sales, for
anticipated returns and allowances on defective merchandise based on
known claims and an estimate of anticipated returns.
Shipping and Handling Costs: The Company accounts for certain
shipping and handling costs as a component of Selling, general and
administrative expenses. These costs represent primarily the
freight and direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack
and otherwise prepare, if necessary, merchandise for shipment to the
Company customers. Total costs were $683,000, $707,000 and
$659,000 in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.                    F-23                   General Bearing Corporation and Subsidiaries

Income Taxes: Prior to the transaction described in Note 2, General
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with World Machinery
Company World through the date of its initial public offering,
completed in February, 1997; thereafter, it filed its own federal
returns. State and local tax returns are filed separately. Federal
income taxes were calculated as if General filed its tax return on a
separate return basis for all periods presented. World filed a
consolidated federal income tax return with its wholly owned
subsidiaries and separate state and local tax returns. Subsequent to
the transaction described in Note 2, the Company will file a
consolidated Federal income tax return.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes, and operating loss carryforwards.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments: Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 107, Disclosure About
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosures of fair
value information about financial instruments, for which it is
practicable to estimate the value, whether or not recognized on the
balance sheet.
The fair value of financial instruments, including cash, accounts
receivable and accounts payable, approximate their carrying value
because of the current nature of these instruments. The carrying
amounts of the Company note payable - bank and long-term debt -
bank approximate fair value because the interest rates on these
instruments are subject to changes with market interest rates. To
reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, the Company
is party to an interest rate swap with its bank Note 8. It is not
practical to determine the fair value of receivables from, payables
to and long-term debt payable to affiliates and other because of the
nature of their terms.
Concentration of Credit Risk: The Company extends credit based on an
evaluation of the customer financial condition, generally without
requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is
principally dependent on each customer financial condition. The
Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains
allowances for anticipated losses. The Company obtained 85%, 77       and 72% of its bearing and component requirements from various
Chinese joint ventures in the fiscal years ended 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. In 2000 and 1999, respectively, the Company
obtained 87% and 64% of its machine tool requirements from various
companies in Romania.
Cash accounts at financial institutions from time to time may exceed
the federal depository insurance coverage limit.
Foreign Currency Translation: Foreign currency financial statements
of foreign operations where the local currency is the functional
currency are translated using exchange rates in effect at period end
for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the
period for results of operations. Related translation adjustments
are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. For
foreign operations where the US dollar is the functional currency
and for countries which are considered highly inflationary,
translation practices differ in that inventories, properties,
accumulated depreciation and depreciation accounts are translated at
historical rates of exchange and translation adjustments are
included in earnings. Gains and losses from foreign currency
transactions are generally included in earnings. All foreign
subsidiaries, except for W.M. Works, use the local currency as the
functional currency. The effect on cash of foreign currency
translation is not material.                    F-24                   General Bearing Corporation and Subsidiaries

Stock-Based Compensation: The Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123 requires entities which have
arrangements under which employees receive shares of stock or other equity
instruments of the employer or the employer incurs liabilities to
employees in amounts based on the price of its stock to either record the
fair value of the arrangements or disclose the proforma effects of the
fair value of the arrangements. The Company has adopted the disclosure
method of SFAS No. 123.
Earnings Per Common Share: Earnings per common share are computed on the
basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the year. Basic earnings per share excludes and diluted earnings per share
includes any dilutive effects of options, warrants, and convertible
securities.
Reclassification: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.
Recent Accounting Standards: In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. FAS 133 is effective, as amended, for years beginning
after June 15, 2000. FAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as
part of the hedged transaction and the type of hedge transaction. The
ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in earnings.
In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 138 FAS 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities which amended FAS 133. The amendments in FAS
138 address certain implementation issues and relate to such matters as
the normal purchases and normal sales exception, the definition of
interest rate risk, hedging recognized foreign currency denominated assets
and liabilities, and intercompany derivatives.
Effective December 31, 2000, the Company will adopt FAS 133 and FAS 138.
The initial impact of adoption on the Company financial statements will
be recorded in the first fiscal quarter of 2001 and will not be material.
The ongoing effect of adoption on the Company consolidated financial
statements will be determined each quarter by several factors, including
the specific hedging instruments in place and their relationships to
hedged items, as well as market conditions at the end of each period.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. SAB 101 provides guidance on applying generally accepted
accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The
Company has adopted SAB 101 in 2000 and there was no material effect on
the Company operating results.                    F-25                   General Bearing Corporation and Subsidiaries
Note 2. Acquisition
In July 2000, General acquired 100% of World Machinery Company, which,
prior to the acquisition, owned 748% of the outstanding common stock of
General. World was principally owned by members of General Bearing Board
of Directors and senior management. World principal business is the
manufacture and sale of machine tools, however, it also holds two bearing
joint ventures for General benefit. This combination has been accounted
for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Prior periods have been
restated as if the companies have always been combined. In consideration
for this transaction, General issued 3,140,000 shares of its common stock,
$ 01 per share par value. 2,950,000 shares of General common stock,
owned by World, are now carried as treasury stock. The net stock of
190,000 shares paid for the acquisition are considered outstanding for all
periods presented.

a  General is obligated to a bank under a revolving line of
credit, which expires on April 30, 2003. The credit agreement
provides General with a secured line of credit of up to $21
million for acquisitions, working capital and general
corporate purposes. The maximum amount available is reduced by
outstanding letters of credit. Interest on outstanding
obligations is payable at either the bank prime rate plus up
to 100%, or LIBOR plus 100% to 200%. These percentages are
determined quarterly based upon the financial performance of
General. The average monthly rate in effect at December 30,
2000 was 783%. Also based upon the financial performance of
General is a commitment fee of either 125% or 25% of unused
availability. The loan is secured by General assets. The
credit agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants,
which include, among others, maintenance of financial ratios
relating to funded debt, fixed charge coverage and interest
coverage and limitations on capital expenditures and
investments. The Company is in compliance with all of its loan
covenants.
As of December 30, 2000, borrowing under the credit line
amounted to $14,753,000, and letter of credit commitments
under this credit line amounted to $1,621,000.
As of December 30, 2000, the Company had $90 million
outstanding in an interest rate swap. This swap is used to
convert floating rate debt relating to the Company revolving
credit agreement to fixed rate debt to reduce the Company
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The net result was to
substitute a fixed interest rate of 917% for the variable
rate. The swap amortizes by $75,000 per month and terminates
in December 2007. Under the interest rate environment during
the year ended December 30, 2000, the Company interest rate
swap agreement resulted in additional expense of approximately
$3,000.                    F-30                   General Bearing Corporation and Subsidiaries

Note 13. Stock Options
In September 1996, General adopted the 1996 Stock Option and Performance
Award Plan 1996 Plan, which authorizes the granting to directors,
officers and key employees of the Company of incentive or non-qualified
stock options, performance shares, restricted shares and performance
units. The 1996 plan covers up to 500,000 shares of common stock.
The exercise price of any incentive stock option granted to an eligible
employee may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares
underlying such option on the date of grant, unless such employee owns
more than 10% of the outstanding common stock or stock of any subsidiary
or parent of the Company, in which case the exercise price of any
incentive stock option may not be less than 110% of such fair market
value. No option may be exercisable                    F-33                   General Bearing Corporation and Subsidiaries
more than ten years after the date of grant and, in the case of an
incentive stock option granted to an eligible employee owning more than
10% of the common stock or stock of any subsidiary or parent of the
Company, no more than five years from its date of grant.
Options are not transferable, except upon the death of the optionee. Upon
death of an optionee, vested options are exercisable according to the
original term of the option grant. In general, upon termination of
employment of an optionee, all options granted to such person which are
not exercisable on the date of such termination immediately expire, and
any options that are exercisable expire three months following termination
of employment if such termination is not the result of death or retirement
and one year following such termination if such termination was because of
death, retirement, disability or with the consent of the Company.
The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option at the grant
date by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions used for grants in the year ended January 1,
2000: no dividend yield, expected volatility of 458%, risk free rates of
50% and expected lives of 5 to 10 years. For the year ended January 2,
1999, the weighted average assumptions used for grants were: no dividend
yield, expected volatility of 373%, risk free interest rates of 47% to
55% and expected lives of 5 to 10 years. If compensation cost for the
Company stock option plan had been determined in accordance with SFAS
No. 123, consolidated net income would have been reduced by approximately
$161,000 or $04 per diluted share, $169,000 or $04 per diluted share,
and $211,000 or $05 per diluted share for the fiscal years ended 2000,
1999, and 1998, respectively. The following table summarizes information

weighted average exercise price of $1236 to $700. This repricing has
resulted in variable accounting for these options. To date, there have
been no charges to the Statement of Operations relating to these options.

Sales Second Quarter 2000: There were no major variances in the Company core
businesses compared to the first quarter. However, taken in the aggregate, the
sales volume decreased due to the strength of the first quarter.
Third Quarter 2000: The sales volume decrease was mainly due to the seasonality
in the OEM Division as well as the beginning of an economic slowdown in the
Company industrial markets.
Fourth Quarter 2000: The sales volume decrease was primarily attributable to
worsening economic conditions in the Company industrial markets and
adjustments at WMG related to a billing error and the timing of sales
recognition totaling $1,292,000 originally recorded in prior quarters.
Third Quarter 1999: The sales volume decrease was mainly due to seasonality in
the OEM Division as well as the timing of orders received on a new product line.
The first large order received on this product line was shipped in the second
quarter.
Net income Second Quarter 2000: The decrease in net income was due to the effect of the
reduced sales volume coupled with a reduction in gross margins in the Machine
Tool segment.
Fourth Quarter 2000: The decrease in net income in the Bearing segment was
primarily due to the reduced sales volume with a reduction in gross margins
including increased inventory provisions $544,000. The decrease in the Machine
Tool segment was mainly due to the reduced sales volume and adjustments
mentioned above as well as increased operating expenses including a write-down
of assets in use $501,000.
Fourth Quarter 1999: The decrease in net income relates primarily to the effect
of changes in foreign exchange rates and accounting rules for financial
reporting in hyperinflationary economies.                    F-41                   General Bearing Corporation and Subsidiaries
