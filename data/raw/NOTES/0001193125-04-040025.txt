December 31, 2003, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO, of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we
file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Subsequent to the date of their evaluation, there were
no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
