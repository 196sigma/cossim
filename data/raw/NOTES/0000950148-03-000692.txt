Item8. Inherent in the application of many of these
accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates
and judgments in the determination of certain revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities. As such, materially different
financial results can occur as circumstances change and
additional information becomes known. The policies with the
greatest potential effect on our results of operation and
financial position include The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment
of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the
aging of the accounts receivable. If there were a deterioration
of a major customers creditworthiness, or actual defaults
were higher than our historical experience, our estimates of the
recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, which
could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our revenue recognition policy is significant because our
revenue is a key component of our results of operations. In
addition, our revenue recognition determines the timing of
certain expenses, such as commissions and royalties. We follow
very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenues;
however, certain judgments affect the application of our revenue
policy. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any
shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause
our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to
quarter. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider
important which could trigger an impairment review include the
following   
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results     
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired
assets or the strategy for our overall business; and     
significant negative industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets
and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of
one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure
any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method
using a discount rate determined by our management to be
commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business
model. Net long-lived assets and goodwill amounted to $2220
million as of December31, 2002.
16 Table of Contents Recent Developments On March11, 2002, we purchased a controlling interest in
Toymax. On October25, 2002 we completed that acquisition,
by acquiring the remaining outstanding common shares. The total
purchase price of approximately $622million consisted of
1,166,360 shares of our common stock, 598,697 stock options and
approximately $410million in cash and resulted in
additional goodwill of $649million. Our results of
operations have included Toymax from March12, 2002,
however for the period March12, 2002 through
October25, 2002 the minority interests share of
Toymaxs earnings were excluded. On November27, 2002, we purchased certain product lines,
assets and assumed certain liabilities from Trendmasters. The
total purchase price of approximately $190million
consisted of all cash and resulted in goodwill of
$262million. Our results of operations have included
Trendmasters from the date of acquisition. Results of Operation The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated,

Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Net Sales. Net sales increased $257million, or
90%, to $3100million in 2002 from $2843million in
2001. The growth in net sales was due primarily to the addition
of the Toymax products and continuing growth in sales of our
Flying Colors and Doll products which was offset in part by a
decrease in sales of our Wheels division, consisting primarily
of our Road Champs die-cast toy and collectible vehicles with
its extreme sports products. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $105million,
or 87%, to $1306million in 2002, or 421% of net sales,
from $1201million, or 422% of net sales, in 2001. The
overall increase in gross profit was attributable to the
increase in net sales. Gross profit margin was compatible to
last year as lower margins for Toymax products were offset by
the decrease in royalty expense as a
17 Table of Contents percentage of net sales due to changes in the product mix
resulting from the sale of more products with lower royalty
rates or proprietary products with no royalties. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $918 million in 2002
and $896million in 2001, constituting 296% and 315% of
net sales, respectively. The overall increase of
$22million in such costs was due to costs incurred in
support of our Kidz Biz and Toymax acquisitions and increased
media buys, offset in part by a decrease in Goodwill
amortization expense based on the implementation of
SFAS142. The decrease as a percentage of net sales is
primarily attributable to the relative fixed nature of certain
expenses with a concurrent increase in net sales. We produced
and aired television commercials in support of several of our
products, including World Wrestling Entertainment action figures
and Flying Colors products, in 2001 and 2002. From time to time,
we may increase our advertising efforts, if we deem it
appropriate for particular products. Acquisition Shut-down and Recall Costs. Acquisition
shut-down costs in 2002 relate to shut-down costs, including
lease termination, fixed asset abandonment and other costs, of
certain operations of Toymax and Kidz Biz. Such costs in 2001
relate to shut-down costs of certain operations of Pentech,
acquired in 2000. Operations impacted by these shut-downs were
sales, design, distribution and administration. The integration
of Pentech was completed in 2001 and the integration of Toymax
and Kidz Biz was completed in 2002. In 2002, we accrued
$22million for the recall of one of our products. The components of the acquisition shut-down and recall costs are

Profit from Joint Venture. Profit from joint venture
increased by $13million in 2002 due to the joint venture
having sales of only carryover titles in 2001 compared to
releasing a new Microsoft Xbox title in addition to having sales
of carryover titles in 2002. New releases typically generate
higher unit sales resulting in higher overall sales as compared
to carryover titles. Profit from the joint venture contributed
significantly to our pre-tax profit, representing 176% of
pre-tax income in 2001 and 195% in 2002. We expect to continue
to receive a preferred return over the remaining term of the
license agreement ending December31, 2009, although we
cannot predict with certainty what levels of return will be
achieved and, in any case, we anticipate substantial
fluctuations in the amount of the preferred return distributed
to us from year to year. Interest, Net. Interest income decreased in 2002 compared
to 2001 in spite of higher average cash balances due to lower
interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes
included Federal, state and foreign income taxes in 2001 and
2002, at effective tax rates of 258% in 2001 and 22% in 2002,
benefiting from a flat 165% Hong Kong Corporation Tax on our
income arising in, or derived from, Hong Kong. The decrease in
the current year effective rate net results primarily from
certain permanently non-taxable items in addition to a continued
shift in profits to more favorable tax jurisdictions. As of
December31, 2002, we had net deferred tax assets of
approximately
18 Table of Contents 39million for which no allowance has been provided
since, in the opinion of management, realization of the future
benefit is probable. In making this determination, management
considered all available evidence, both positive and negative,
as well as the weight and importance given to such evidence. Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Net Sales. Net sales increased $320million, or
127%, to $2843million in 2001 from $2523million
in 2000. The growth in net sales was due primarily to the
continuing growth in sales of our Flying Colors product and an
increase in sales of our World Wrestling Entertainment wrestling
products, as well as the addition of Pentech products, which
began contributing to operations in August 2000, and the
introduction of our products based on the Battlebots television
show though offset by a decrease in sales of our Doll products
and our Wheels products, consisting primarily of our Road Champs
die-cast toy and collectible vehicles including BXS die-cast
bicycle, MXS die-cast motorcycles and other extreme sports
products. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $177million,
or 173%, to $1201million in 2001, or 422% of net sales,
from $1024million, or 406% of net sales, in 2000. The
overall increase in gross profit was attributable to the
increase in net sales and the increase in the gross profit
margin. The increase in gross profit margin of 16% of net sales
is primarily attributable to the decrease in royalty expense as
a percentage of net sales due to changes in the product mix and
lower product costs, which was partially offset by an increase
in amortization expense relating to molds and tools used in the
manufacture of our products. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $896million in
2001 and $804million in 2000, constituting 315% and
319% of net sales, respectively. The overall increase of
$92million in such costs in 2001 was due in large part to
a $50million dollar reserve on accounts receivable
relating to the Chapter11 bankruptcy filing of Kmart,
which was filed in January of 2002, and the increase in net
sales with its proportionate impact on variable selling costs
such as freight and shipping related expenses, sales
commissions, cooperative advertising and travel expenses, among
others. The decrease as a percentage of net sales in primarily
attributable to the fixed nature of certain of these expenses
with a concurrent increase in net sales. We produced and aired
television commercials in support of several of our products,
including World Wrestling Entertainment action figures, Road
Champs extreme sports products and Flying Colors products in
2000 and 2001. From time to time, we may increase our
advertising efforts, if we deem it is appropriate for particular
products. Acquisition Shut-down and Other Costs. Acquisition
shut-down and other costs in 2001 relate to shut-down costs,
including lease termination, relocation and consulting fees and
expenses, of certain operations of Pentech, acquired in 2000,
and such costs in 2000 relate to shut-down costs, including
lease termination, relocation, and consulting fees and expenses
of certain operations of Flying Colors, acquired in 1999.
Operations impacted by both shut-downs were sales, design,
distribution, and administration. Total Pentech costs is
comprised of $03million relating to lease terminations
and abandonments, $02million in consulting fees and
expenses incurred to facilitate the integration 04million relating to relocation expense, and
$01million relating to the abandonments of other assets.
Twenty-one Pentech employees received severance totaling
$04million, that was accrued in the fourth quarter of
2000 and was fully paid out by June30, 2001. The
integration of Pentech was substantially completed in the second
quarter of 2001 and related costs are expected to be nominal in
future quarters. In 2000, total Flying Colors costs is comprised
of $02million relating to lease terminations and
abandonments and $03million relating
19 Table of Contents to relocation expense. The integration of Flying Colors was
completed in 2000. Additionally, 2000 includes $06million
relating to the recall of one of our products. Profit from Joint Venture. Profit from our joint venture
with THQ decreased in 2001 due to a decrease in our preferred
return resulting from fewer releases of World Wrestling
Entertainment video games by our joint venture in 2001 than
in 2000. In 2001, the joint venture released two Nintendo
GameBoy titles, which have lower unit sales and sales prices
than the other game platforms, and one Sony Play Station2
title along with modest carryover sales of titles released in
2000 and earlier, as compared to 2000, in which the joint
venture released a total of four new titles consisting of two
Sony Play Station titles, one Nintendo64 title and one
Sega Dreamcast title in addition to strong carryover sales of
the two 1999 releases. Profit from the joint venture contributed
significantly to our pre-tax profit, representing 394% of
pre-tax income in 2000 and 176% in 2001. Through June30,
2006, we are entitled to receive a guaranteed preferred return
at varying rates of net sales of the video games depending on
the cumulative unit sales and platform of each particular game,
and after June30, 2006, the amount of the preferred return
is subject to renegotiation between THQ and us. The minimum
preferred return to be distributed to us by the joint venture
during each of the years in the period ending December31,
2003 is $26million per year. We expect our aggregate
return over the remaining term of the license agreement ending
December31, 2009 to be significantly in excess of this
amount, although we cannot predict with certainty that expected
levels of return will be achieved and, in any case, we
anticipate substantial fluctuations in the amount of the
preferred return distributed to us from year to year. Interest, Net. Interest income decreased in 2001 due to
lower average cash balances during 2001 than in 2000 as a result
of significant disbursements made in the third and fourth
quarters of 2000 related to the acquisition of Pentech and the
repurchase by the Company of its common stock. Interest expense
was nominal in 2000 and 2001. Provision for Income Taxes. Provision for income taxes
included Federal, state and foreign income taxes in 2000 and
2001, at effective tax rates of 29% in 2000 and 258% in 2001,
benefiting from a flat 165% Hong Kong Corporation Tax on our
income arising in, or derived from, Hong Kong. As of
December31, 2001, we had deferred tax assets of
approximately $04million for which no allowance has been
provided since, in the opinion of management, realization of the
future benefit is probable. In making this determination,
management considered all available evidence, both positive and
negative, as well as the weight and importance given to such
evidence. Quarterly Fluctuations and Seasonality We have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in
operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the
future. The operating results for any quarter are not
necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Our
first quarter is typically expected to be the least profitable
as a result of lower net sales but substantially similar fixed
operating expenses. This is consistent with the performance of
many companies in the toy industry.

During the second quarter of 2000, we recorded a charge which
impacted operating income by approximately $14million
relating to the recall of one of our products. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of
$50million to bad debt impacting operating income
relating to the bankruptcy filing of one of our customers, Kmart. During the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a charge which
impacted operating income by approximately $66million
relating to the restructuring of Toymax and Kidz Biz. During the second quarter of 2002, we recorded a charge which
impacted operating income by approximately $15million
relating to the recall of one of our products. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we reversed $21million
of the restructuring charge recorded in the first quarter of
2002 and recorded an additional charge of approximately $07
million relating to the recall of one of our products, the net
of which favorably impacted operating income by approximately
$14 million. In addition, our effective tax rate for the year
2002 was reduced from 26% to 22%. Recent Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS143. The objective of
SFAS143 is to establish an accounting standard for the
recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation on
certain long-lived assets. The retirement obligation must be one
that results from the acquisition, construction or normal
operation of a long-lived asset. SFAS143 requires the
legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible
long-lived asset to be recognized at fair value as a liability
when incurred, and the cost to be capitalized by increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. SFAS143
will be effective for the Companys fiscal year beginning
January1, 2003. The adoption of this statement will have
no material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
SFAS144. SFAS144 supersedes Statements
of Financial Accounting Standards No121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of SFAS121 and
retains the
21 Table of Contents basic requirements of SFAS121 regarding when and how to
measure an impairment loss. SFAS144 provides additional
implementation guidance on accounting for an impairment loss.
SFAS144 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2001. The Company adopted SFAS144
beginning in fiscal 2002, the adoption of which did not have a
material effect on the Companys financial position or
results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No145, Rescission of Statements
No4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No13,
and Technical Correction SFAS145.
SFAS145 eliminates extraordinary accounting treatment for
reporting gains or losses on debt extinguishments, and amends
other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various
technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their
applicability under changed conditions. The provisions of this
SFAS are effective for fiscal years beginning after May15,
2002; however, early application of SFAS145 is encouraged.
Debt extinguishments reported as extraordinary items prior to
scheduled or early adoption of this SFAS would be reclassified
to other income in most cases following adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption
of SFAS145 would have on its consolidated results of
operations subject to the evaluation in accordance with
APB30, Reporting the Results of
Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFAS146, which changes the accounting for
costs such as lease termination costs and certain employee
severance costs that are associated with a restructuring,
discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal
activity initiated after December31, 2002. The standard
requires companies to recognize the fair value of costs
associated with exit or disposal activities when they are
incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or
disposal plan. The Company anticipates that the adoption of SFAS146 will
not have a material effect on the Companys financial
position or results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December31, 2002, we had working capital of
$1292million, as compared to $1165million as of
December31, 2001. This increase was primarily attributable
to the receipt of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock
and from operating activities offset in part by disbursements
relating to the acquisitions of Toymax and Trendmasters. Operating activities provided net cash of $662million
including the sale of marketable securities of
$371million in the year ended December31, 2002 as
compared to $134million, net of the purchase of
marketable securities of $235million, in 2001. Net cash
was provided primarily by net income and non-cash charges, such
as depreciation and amortization, the forgiveness of an officer
note receivable and minority interest, as well as decreases in
prepaid expenses and other current operating assets, the sale of
marketable securities and increases in the reserve for sales
returns and allowances, income taxes payable and deferred income
taxes, which were offset in part by a non-cash benefit
consisting of earned compensation from stock option grants,
increases in the preferred return from THQ joint venture,
accounts receivable, inventory, advanced royalty payments and
decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. As of
December31, 2002, we had cash and cash equivalents of
$684million and no marketable securities.
22 Table of Contents Operating activities provided net cash of $134 million, net of
the purchase of marketable securities of $235million, in
the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to
$300million, including the sale of marketable securities
of $257million, in 2000. Net cash was provided primarily
by net income and non-cash charges, such as depreciation and
amortization and recognition of compensation expense from stock
option grants, as well as the increases in accrued expenses and
deferred income taxes and decrease in the preferred return due
form the joint venture, which were offset in part by increases
in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in the
reserve for sales returns and allowances and income taxes
payable. As of December31, 2001, we had cash and cash
equivalents of $250million and marketable securities of
$371million. Our investing activities used cash of $878million in the
year ended December31, 2002, as compared to
$194million in 2001, consisting primarily of the purchase
of office furniture and equipment and molds and tooling used in
the manufacture of our products, the goodwill acquired in the
acquisitions of Toymax and Trendmasters, the $45 million in
goodwill relating to the final earn-out for Flying Colors, and
the increase in other assets, partially offset by the repayment
of notes receivable from officers. In 2001, our investing
activities consisted primarily of the purchase of molds and
tooling used in the manufacture of our products, the goodwill
acquired in the acquisitions of Kidz Biz Ltd. and Kidz Biz Far
East, plus the $45 million in goodwill relating to the 2001
earn-out for Flying Colors, partially offset by the repayment of
notes receivable from officers. As part of our strategy to
develop and market new products, we have entered into various
character and product licenses with royalties ranging from 1% to
12% payable on net sales of such products. As of
December31, 2002, these agreements required future
aggregate minimum guarantees of $194 million, exclusive of $29
million in advances already paid. Our investing activities used net cash of $194million in
the year ended December31, 2001, as compared to
$479million in 2000, consisting primarily of the purchase
of molds and tooling used in the manufacture of our products in
2001 and 2000, and goodwill acquired in the acquisitions of Kidz
Biz Ltd. and Kidz Biz Far East in 2001 and Pentech in 2000. As
part of our strategy to develop and market new products, we have
entered into various character and product licenses with
royalties ranging from 1% to 12% payable on net sales of such
products. As of December31, 2001, these agreements
required future aggregate minimum guarantees of
$115million, exclusive of $20million in advances
already paid. Our financing activities provided net cash of $649million
in the year ended December31, 2002, as compared to
$18million in 2001. In 2002, cash was primarily provided
from the sale of our common stock and from the exercise of stock
options and warrants, partially offset by the repayment of
long-term debt. In 2001, cash was primarily provided from the
exercise of stock options and warrants, partially offset by the
repayment of debt assumed in the acquisition of Pentech. Our financing activities provided net cash of $18million
in the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to having used
cash of $104million in 2000. In 2000, we used cash
primarily to repurchase 1,493,600shares of our common
stock for a total of $129million, while cash was provided
by the exercise of stock options and warrants and the assumption
of debt related to the acquisition of Pentech. Net cash provided
in 2001 consisted primarily of proceeds from the exercise of
stock options and warrants, offset by the repayment of debt
assumed in the acquisition of Pentech. During 2002, we acquired all the outstanding common shares of
Toymax for cash of approximately $410 million and 1,166,360
shares of our common stock and paid off approximately
23 Table of Contents 123million of indebtedness. In November 2002, we
acquired certain assets of Trendmasters for approximately $190
million and paid off approximately $37million of
indebtedness in cash. The following is a summary of our significant contractual cash
obligations for the periods indicated that existed as of
December31, 2002 and is based on information appearing in

In May and June 2002, we received an aggregate of
$591million in net proceeds from the sale of
3,525,000shares of our common stock in an under-written
public offering. These proceeds, which we invested temporarily
in marketable securities and cash equivalents, were applied to
our product acquisition, development, working capital and
general corporate needs. In December 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding capital
stock of Kidz Biz Limited, a United Kingdom company, and an
affiliated Hong Kong company, Kidz Biz Far East Limited, for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $124million.
Total consideration was paid on the closing of the transaction
in cash in the amount of $64million and the issuance of
308,992shares of our common stock at a value of
$60million. In addition, we agreed to pay an earn-out for
each of 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, based on the year over year
increase in Kidz Biz sales, payable by delivery of up to 25,749
shares of our common stock. In 2002, nothing was earned. In October1999, we acquired Flying Colors Toys for
approximately $347million in cash for the stock and paid
off approximately $176million of indebtedness. In
addition, we also paid an earn-out of up to $45million in
each of the three twelve-month periods following the closing
because the gross profit of Flying Colors products
achieved certain targeted levels during these periods. In October 2001, we secured a syndicated line of credit totaling
$500million with a consortium of banks led by Bank of
America, N.A. Line of Credit. The Line of Credit
will be available for future acquisitions and working capital
and is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and
contains customary financial and non-financial covenants which
require us to maintain a minimum net worth and limit our ability
to incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends or make
distributions, sell assets and enter into certain mergers or
acquisitions. We are required to not have any outstanding
borrowings in excess of $300million for a period of at
least 30 consecutive days during the first fiscal quarter of
each year of the agreement. Amounts outstanding under this
facility bear interest at 025% plus the greater of the Prime
Rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 05%, subject to adjustment
based on certain financial ratios. As of December31, 2002,
we had no outstanding borrowings. In February 2003, our Board of Directors approved a buyback of
up to $20million of our common stock. As of March27,
2003, we repurchased 330,000 shares of our common stock for a
total of approximately $34million.
24 Table of Contents We believe that our cash flows from operations, cash and cash
equivalents on hand and the availability under the Line of
Credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and
capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate
liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least
the next 12months. Although operating activities are
expected to provide cash, to the extent we grow significantly in
the future, our operating and investing activities may use cash
and, consequently, this growth may require us to obtain
additional sources of financing. There can be no assurance that
any necessary additional financing will be available to us on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Exchange Rates Sales from our United States and Hong Kong operations are
denominated in U.S. dollars and our manufacturing costs are
denominated in either U.S. or Hong Kong dollars. Domestic sales
from our United Kingdom operations and operating expenses of all
of our operations are denominated in local currency, thereby
creating exposure to changes in exchange rates. Changes in the
Hong Kong dollar or British Pound/U.S. dollar exchange rate may
positively or negatively affect our gross margins, operating
income and retained earnings. The exchange rate of the Hong Kong
dollar to the U.S. dollar has been fixed by the Hong Kong
government since 1983 at HK$780 to US$100 and, accordingly,
has not represented a currency exchange risk to the U.S. dollar.
We cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the United
States and Hong Kong currencies will continue to be fixed or
that exchange rate fluctuations between the United States and
Hong Kong and United Kingdom currencies will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows due to
adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and
rates. We are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in
United States and international borrowing rates and changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we are exposed to
market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or
remain vulnerable to an economic downturn, such as China. We
purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in
China, and, therefore, we are subject to the risk that such
suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive
prices. While we believe that, if such an event were to occur we
would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at
competitive prices, we cannot assure you that we would be able
to do so. These exposures are directly related to our normal
operating and funding activities. Historically and as of
December31, 2002, we have not used derivative instruments
or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2002, we do not have any outstanding balances
on our Line of Credit, and we have only nominal interest-bearing
obligations. Accordingly, we are not generally subject to any
direct risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Risk We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Hong Kong and the United
Kingdom. Sales from our United States and Hong Kong operations
are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, domestic sales from
the United Kingdom, purchases of inventory and operating
expenses are typically denominated in local currency, thereby
creating exposure to changes in exchange rates. Changes in the
Hong
25 Table of Contents Kong dollar or British Pound/U.S. dollar exchange rate may
positively or negatively affect our gross margins, operating
income and retained earnings. The exchange rate of the Hong Kong
dollar to the U.S. dollar has been fixed by the Hong Kong
government since 1983 at HK$780 to US$100 and, accordingly,
has not represented a currency exchange risk to the U.S. dollar.
We do not believe that near-term changes in exchange rates, if
any, will result in a material effect on our future earnings,
fair values or cash flows, and therefore, we have chosen not to
enter into foreign currency hedging transactions. With respect
to the British Pound, we will monitor its volatility frequently
throughout the coming year. While we have not engaged in foreign
currency hedging, we may in the future use hedging programs to
reduce financial market risks if it is determined that such
hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk. We cannot
assure you that this approach will be successful, especially in
the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of
these currencies. 26 Table of Contents Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Stockholders JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December31,
2001 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders equity and cash flows and the
financial statement schedule for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2002. These financial statements
and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and the financial
statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and
schedule referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of JAKKS Pacific, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December31, 2001 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2002, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. As discussed in note2 to these consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for the
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in
accordance with guidance provided by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, in 2002.

31 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS DECEMBER31, 2002 Note 1Principal industry JAKKS Pacific, Inc. the Company is engaged in the
development, production and marketing of toys and related
products, some of which are based on highly-recognized
entertainment properties and character licenses. The Company
commenced its primary business operations in July 1995 through
the purchase of substantially all of the assets of a Hong Kong
toy company. The Company markets its product lines domestically
and internationally. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware in January 1995. Note 2Summary of significant accounting policies Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In consolidation, all
significant inter-company balances and transactions are
eliminated. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid assets, having an
original maturity of less than three months, to be cash
equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposits
which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The
Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The
Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit
risk on cash and cash equivalents. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual future results
could differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized upon the shipment of goods to customers.
Provisions for estimated returns, defective products, markdowns
and other allowances are made at the time of sale. Inventory Inventory, which includes the ex-factory cost of goods and
in-bound freight, is valued at the lower of cost first-in,
first-out or market and consists of the following

Continued DECEMBER31, 2002 Marketable securities Marketable securities have been categorized as trading and as a
result are stated at fair value, with unrealized holding gains
and losses included in earnings. At December31, 2001 and
2002, such gains and losses were not material. Fair value of financial instruments The Companys cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and notes payable represent financial instruments.
The carrying value of these financial instruments is a
reasonable approximation of fair value. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and are being
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated
useful lives as follows   
Office equipment
5 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 - 7 years
Molds and tooling
2 - 4 years

Shipping and handling costs The consolidated financial statements reflect, for all periods
presented, the adoption of the classification or disclosure
requirements pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and
Handling Fees and Costs, which was effective in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2000. Consistent with EITF 00-10, the Company
has historically classified income from freight charges to
customers in Net sales. The Company classifies
shipping and handling costs in Selling, general and
administrative expenses. Such costs amounted to
approximately $8,127,000 in 2000, $11,940,000 in 2001 and
$8,135,000 in 2002. Advertising Production costs of commercials and programming are charged to
operations in the year during which the production is first
aired. The costs of other advertising, promotion and marketing
programs are charged to operations in the year incurred.
Advertising expense for the years ended December31, 2000,
2001 and 2002, was approximately $14,416,000, $11,026,000 and
$12,697,000, respectively. Income taxes The Company does not file a consolidated return with its foreign
subsidiaries. The Company files Federal and state returns and
its foreign subsidiaries each file Hong Kong returns. Deferred
taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax
assets are recognized as deductible temporary differences and
operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and deferred tax
liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.
Temporary differences are the differences between the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the
opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some
33 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued DECEMBER31, 2002 portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects
of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Translation of foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Hong Kong dollars
or British Pounds Sterling are translated into United States
dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date. Transactions during the period are translated at the rates
ruling at the dates of the transactions. Profits and losses resulting from the above translation policy
are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets, which include property and equipment,
goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill, are
evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
from the use of these assets. When any such impairment exists,
the related assets will be written down to fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No141, Business Combinations
SFAS141 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS142. SFAS141 is effective for business
combinations initiated after June30, 2001. SFAS141
requires that all business combinations completed after its
adoption be accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and establishes specific criteria for the recognition
of intangible assets separately from goodwill. SFAS142 was
effective for the Company on January1, 2002 and primarily
addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets
subsequent to their acquisition. With the adoption of
SFAS142, goodwill and other intangible assets are no
longer amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually
at the reporting unit level. As of December31, 2002, there
was no impairment to the underlying value of goodwill or
intangible assets other than goodwill.

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair
market value of the assets of acquired toy companies. In fiscal
2002, the Company began to write off goodwill and certain
intangible assets on an impairment basis where losses in value
are recorded when and as material impairment has occurred in the
underlying assets. Accumulated amortization of goodwill at
December31, 2001 and 2002 totaled $6,577,121. The carrying value of goodwill is based on managements
current assessment of recoverability. Management evaluates
recoverability using both objective and subjective factors.
Objective factors include managements best estimates of
projected future earnings and cash flows and analysis of recent
sales and earnings trends. Subjective factors include
competitive analysis and the Companys strategic focus. Intangible assets other than goodwill consist of product
technology rights and trademarks. Intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis, over five to thirty years,
the estimated economic lives of the related assets. Accumulated
amortization as of December31, 2001 and 2002 was
$1,961,113 and $2,910,386, respectively. Stock Option Plans In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No148 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure
an Amendment of FASB Statement No123
SFAS148. SFAS148 Statement amends Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS123, to provide alternative
methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to
the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions
of that Statement to require prominent disclosure about the
effects on reported net income of an entitys
35 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued DECEMBER31, 2002 accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee
compensation. Finally, SFAS148 amends APB Opinion
No28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure
about those effects in interim financial information. At December31, 2002, the Company has stock-based employee
compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note14. The Company accounts for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation
cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under
those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of
the underlying common stock on the date of grant. However,
certain options had been repriced resulting in compensation
adjustments, which have been reflected in net income. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS123, to stock-based employee
compensation. In 2000, 2001 and 2002 the fair value of each employee option
grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions used:
risk-free rate of interest of 6%, 6% and 4%, respectively;
dividend yield of 0%; with volatility of 94%, 91% and 87%
respectively; and expected lives of five years.

Recent Accounting
Standards In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
SFAS143. The objective of SFAS143 is to establish
an accounting standard for the recognition and measurement of an
asset retirement obligation on certain long-lived assets. The
37 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued DECEMBER31, 2002 retirement obligation must be one that results from the
acquisition, construction or normal operation of a long-lived
asset. SFAS143 requires the legal obligation associated
with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset to be
recognized at fair value as a liability when incurred, and the
cost to be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the
related long-lived asset. SFAS143 will be effective for
the Companys fiscal year beginning January1, 2003.
The adoption of this statement will have no material impact on
the consolidated financial statements. In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
SFAS144. SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS No121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of
Statement121 and retains the basic
requirements of SFAS121 regarding when and how to measure
an impairment loss. SFAS144 provides additional
implementation guidance on accounting for an impairment loss.
SFAS144 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2001. The Company adopted SFAS144
beginning in fiscal 2002, the adoption of which did not have a
material effect on the Companys financial position or
results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement No145,
Rescission of Statements No4, 44 and 64, Amendment
of FASB Statement No13, and Technical Correction
SFAS145. SFAS145 eliminates extraordinary
accounting treatment for reporting gains or losses on debt
extinguishments, and amends other existing authoritative
pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify
meanings, or describe their applicability under changed
conditions. The provisions of this SFAS are effective for fiscal
years beginning after May15, 2002; however, early
application of SFAS145 is encouraged. Debt extinguishments
reported as extraordinary items prior to scheduled or early
adoption of this SFAS would be reclassified to other income in
most cases following adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of
SFAS145 would have on its consolidated results of
operations subject to the evaluation in accordance with
APB30, Reporting the Results of
Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities SFAS146, which changes the accounting
for costs such as lease termination costs and certain employee
severance costs that are associated with a restructuring,
discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal
activity initiated after December31, 2002. The standard
requires companies to recognize the fair value of costs
associated with exit or disposal activities when they are
incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or
disposal plan. The Company anticipates that the adoption of SFAS 146 will not
have a material effect on the Companys financial position
or results of operations. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years balances
in order to conform to the current year presentation.

Note4 Acquisitions and Joint Venture The Company owns a fifty percent interest in a joint venture
with a company that develops, publishes and distributes
interactive entertainment software for the leading hardware game
platforms in the home video game market. The joint venture has
entered into a license agreement under which it acquired the
exclusive worldwide right to publish video games on all hardware
platforms. The Companys investment is accounted for using
the cost method due to the financial and operating structure of
the venture and our lack of control over the joint venture. The
Companys basis consists primarily of organizational costs
and recoupable advances. The joint venture agreement provides
for the Company to receive guaranteed preferred returns through
June30, 2006, subject to annual minimum payments of
$2,600,000 through December31, 2003, at varying rates of
the joint ventures net sales depending on the cumulative
unit sales and platform of each particular game. For periods
after June30, 2006, the amount of the preferred return
will be subject to renegotiation between the parties. The
preferred return is accrued in the quarter in which the licensed
games are sold and the preferred return is earned. The
Companys joint venture partner retains the financial risk
of the joint venture and is responsible for the day-to-day
operations 40 Table of Contents JAKKS PACIFIC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued DECEMBER31, 2002 including development, sales and distribution, for which they
are entitled to any remaining profits. During 2000, 2001 and
2002, the Company earned $15,905,860, $6,675,428 and $8,003,925,
respectively, in profit from the joint venture. In October 1999, the Company acquired all of the stock of Flying
Colors Toys, Inc. Flying Colors for $52,879,182 in
cash paid at closing. Contingent consideration paid included an
earn-out of $4,500,000 in each of the three 12-month periods
following the closing, because gross profit of Flying Colors
branded products achieved certain prescribed levels in each of
such periods. Of the $4,500,000 earned in 2000, the amount of
$464,938 was deemed to be compensation and has been expensed in
2000. The remaining balance of $4,035,062 and the 2001 and 2002
earn-outs have been recorded as goodwill. In December2001, the Company acquired all the outstanding
stock of Kidz Biz Ltd., a United Kingdom company, and Kidz Biz
Far East Limited, a Hong Kong corporation, collectively
KidzBiz, for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $124million, which was paid by the issuance
of 308,992 shares of the Companys common stock at a value
of $60million and cash of $64million. Both the
United Kingdom and Hong Kong based companies are distributors of
toys and related products in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the
Channel Islands. The Company acquired the following entities to further enhance
its existing product lines and to continue diversification into
other seasonal business. On March11, 2002, the Company purchased a controlling
interest in Toymax International, Inc. Toymax. On
October25, 2002, we completed that acquisition by
acquiring the remaining outstanding common shares in a merger
transaction. The total purchase price of approximately
$622million consisted of 1,166,360 shares of the
Companys common stock, 598,697 options and approximately
$410million in cash. Results of operations have included
Toymax from March12, 2002; however, for the period from
March12, 2002 through October25, 2002, the minority
interests share of Toymaxs earnings were excluded. On November27, 2002, the Company purchased certain product
lines, assets and assumed certain specific liabilities from
Trendmasters, Inc. Trendmasters. The total
purchase price of approximately $190million consisted of
all cash. Results of operations have included Trendmasters from
the date of acquisition. The total purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair

Deferred taxes result from temporary differences between tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in
the consolidated financial statements. The temporary differences
result from costs required to be capitalized for tax purposes by
the U.S.Internal Revenue Code IRC, and
certain items accrued for financial reporting purposes in the
year incurred but not deductible for tax purposes until paid. As of December31, 2002, the Company has federal and state
net operating loss carryforwards of $276million and
$43million, respectively, expiring through 2023. These
carryforwards resulted from the acquisitions of Pentech and
Toymax; the utilization of these losses to offset future income
is limited under IRC382. The Companys management
concluded that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance was not
necessary.
