Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Subsidiaries Houston, Texas
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of
December31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and
subsidiaries at December31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February19, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Diamond Offshore
Drilling, Inc. and Subsidiaries Houston, Texas We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item9A of
this Form 10-K under the heading Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on
the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements
as of and for the year ended December31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated February19, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. General Information 
Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. is a leader in offshore drilling, providing contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe
with a fleet of 32 offshore drilling rigs, consisting of eight ultra-deepwater, seven deepwater and eight mid-water semisubmersibles, four dynamically positioned drillships and five jack-ups. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in
these Notes to Diamond Offshore, we, us or our mean Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1989. 
As of February16, 2016, Loews Corporation, or Loews, owned 53% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. 
Principles of Consolidation Our
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and our subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances. 
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S., or GAAP,
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less and deposits in money market mutual
funds that are readily convertible into cash to be cash equivalents. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign
currencies was not material for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Marketable Securities 
We classify our investments in marketable securities as available for sale and they are stated at fair value in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Accordingly, any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Accumulated other comprehensive gain loss until realized. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization
of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity and such adjustments are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in Interest income. The sale and purchase of securities are recorded on the date of the trade. The cost of
debt securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains or losses, as well as any declines in value that are judged to be other than temporary, are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in Other
income expense Other, net. See Note 6. 
60 Table of Contents
Provision for Bad Debts 
We record a provision for bad debts on a case-by-case basis when facts and circumstances indicate that a customer receivable may not be
collectible. In establishing these reserves, we consider historical and other factors that predict collectability, including write-offs, recoveries and the monitoring of credit quality. Such provision is reported as a component of Operating
expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 3. Derivative Financial Instruments 
Our derivative financial instruments have primarily consisted of foreign currency forward exchange, or FOREX, contracts which we may designate
as cash flow hedges. In accordance with GAAP, each derivative contract is stated in the balance sheet at its fair value with gains and losses reflected in the income statement except that, to the extent the derivative qualifies for and is designated
as an accounting hedge, the gains and losses are reflected in income in the same period as offsetting gains and losses on the qualifying hedged positions. Designated hedges are expected to be highly effective, and therefore, adjustments to record
the carrying value of the effective portion of our derivative financial instruments to their fair value are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive gain loss, or AOCGL, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
effective portion of the cash flow hedge will remain in AOCGL until it is reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or it is determined that the hedged transaction will not occur. We
report such realized gains and losses as a component of Contract drilling, excluding depreciation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in our expenditures in local
foreign currencies in the countries in which we operate. Adjustments to record the carrying value of the ineffective portion of our
derivative financial instruments to fair value and realized gains or losses upon settlement of derivative contracts not designated as cash flow hedges are reported as Foreign currency transaction gain loss in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations. See Notes 7 and 8. Assets Held For Sale 
At December31, 2015, we reported the $142 million carrying value of five of our jack-up rigs as Assets held for sale in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. One of these rigs was subsequently sold for $80 million in February 2016. See Notes 2 and 9. Drilling and Other Property
and Equipment We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and routine
repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments that upgrade or increase the functionality of our existing equipment and that significantly extend the useful life of an existing asset, are capitalized. Significant
judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required in determining whether or not such replacements and betterments meet the criteria for capitalization and in determining useful lives and salvage values of such assets. Changes in these judgments,
assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. During the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $2624 million and $5460 million, respectively, in replacements and betterments of our drilling
fleet. Costs incurred for major rig upgrades and/or the construction of rigs are accumulated in construction work-in-progress, with no
depreciation recorded on the additions, until the month the upgrade or newbuild is completed and the rig is placed in service. Upon retirement or sale of a rig, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts
and any gains or losses are included in our results of operations as Gain on disposition of assets. Depreciation is recognized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful lives
from the year the asset is placed in service. Drilling rigs and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years. 
61 Table of Contents
Capitalized Interest 
We capitalize interest cost for qualifying construction and upgrade projects. During the three years ended December31, 2015, we
capitalized interest on qualifying expenditures, primarily related to our rig construction projects. See Note 9. A reconciliation of our
total interest cost to Interest expense as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows:  For the Year Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 In thousands Total interest cost including amortization of debt issuance costs 110,242 122,656 99,080 Capitalized interest 16,308 60,603 74,237 
Total interest expense as reported 93,934 62,053 24,843 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable such as, but not limited to, cold stacking a rig, the expectation of cold stacking a rig in the near term, contracted backlog of less than one year for a rig, a decision to retire or scrap a rig, or excess spending over budget on a
newbuild, construction project or major rig upgrade. We utilize an undiscounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following: dayrate by rig;  utilization rate by rig if active, warm stacked or cold stacked expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used at certain dayrates; the per day operating cost for each rig if active, warm stacked or cold stacked;  the estimated annual cost for rig replacements and/or enhancement programs;  the estimated maintenance, inspection or other costs associated with a rig returning to work;  salvage value for each rig; and  estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of each rig. Based on these
assumptions, we develop a matrix for each rig under evaluation using multiple utilization/dayrate scenarios, to each of which we have assigned a probability of occurrence. We arrive at a projected probability weighted cash flow for each rig
based on the respective matrix and compare such amount to the carrying value of the asset to assess recoverability. The underlying
assumptions and assigned probabilities of occurrence for utilization and dayrate scenarios are developed using a methodology that examines historical data for each rig, which considers the rigs age, rated water depth and other attributes and
then assesses its future marketability in light of the current and projected market environment at the time of assessment. Other assumptions, such as operating, maintenance and inspection costs, are estimated using historical data adjusted for known
developments and future events that are anticipated by management at the time of the assessment. Managements assumptions are
necessarily subjective and are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation, and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Our methodology generally involves the use of significant
unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value 
62 Table of Contents
measurement, which may include assumptions related to future dayrate revenue, costs and rig utilization, quotes from rig brokers, the long-term future performance of our rigs and future market
conditions. Managements assumptions involve uncertainties about future demand for our services, dayrates, expenses and other future events, and managements expectations may not be indicative of future outcomes. Significant unanticipated
changes to these assumptions could materially alter our analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. For example, changes in market conditions that exist at the measurement date or that are projected by management could affect our key
assumptions. Other events or circumstances that could affect our assumptions may include, but are not limited to, a further sustained decline in oil and gas prices, cancelations of our drilling contracts or contracts of our competitors, contract
modifications, costs to comply with new governmental regulations, growth in the global oversupply of oil and geopolitical events, such as lifting sanctions on oil-producing nations. Should actual market conditions in the future vary significantly
from market conditions used in our projections, our assessment of impairment would likely be different. See Note 2. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments We believe that the carrying amount of our current financial instruments approximates fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments. See Note 8. Debt Issuance Costs 
Debt issuance costs are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2015 and 2014 in Other assets and are
amortized over the respective terms of the related debt. In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30;
Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, or ASU 2015-03, which requires debt issuance costs associated with our senior notes See Note 10 to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the
related senior note. This change is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We will be adopting the provisions of ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016, which will affect only the
presentation of such amounts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes 
We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable
for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In
each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to
temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a
more likely than not approach. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization
of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit. We record interest related to
accrued unrecognized tax positions in interest expense and recognize penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our tax expense. See Note 15. 
Current GAAP requires a reporting entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a
classified statement of financial position based on the underlying assets and liabilities to which such deferred income taxes relate. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the FASB issued ASU No2015-17, Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes, or ASU 2015-17, in November 2015, which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of 
63 Table of Contents
financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December15, 2016 with earlier application permitted. We have elected to early adopt ASU
2015-17 and are prospectively applying the classification requirements as of the beginning of 2015. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31, 2014 has not been retrospectively adjusted. See Note 15. 
Treasury Stock In connection with the
vesting of restricted stock units held by our chief executive officer, or CEO, in 2015, we acquired 7,810 shares of our common stock valued at $02 million in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations that were incurred on the vesting date. See
Note 3. Depending on market conditions, we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock in the open market or otherwise.
We account for the purchase of treasury stock using the cost method, which reports the cost of the shares acquired in Treasury stock as a deduction from stockholders equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended
December31, 2014, we repurchased 1,895,561 shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $878 million. We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during 2015 or 2013. 
Comprehensive Income Loss 
Comprehensive income loss is the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances except those transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income loss for the three years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes net income loss and unrealized holding
gains and losses on marketable securities and financial derivatives designated as cash flow accounting hedges. See Note 11. Foreign Currency 
Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reported as Foreign currency transaction
gain loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and include, when applicable, unrealized gains and losses to record the carrying value of our FOREX contracts not designated as accounting hedges, as well as realized gains and losses
from the settlement of such contracts. For the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized aggregate net foreign currency gains losses of $25 million, $32 million and $49 million, respectively. See Note 7. 
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue
from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, we may receive fees on either a lump-sum or dayrate basis for the mobilization of equipment. We earn these fees as services are performed over
the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization fees received, as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred, and amortize each, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts
which is the period we estimate to be benefited from the mobilization activity. Straight-line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts which generally range from two to 60 months is
consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. Absent a contract, mobilization costs are recognized currently. Upon completion of a drilling contract, we recognize in earnings any demobilization
fees received and costs incurred. Some of our drilling contracts require downtime before the start of the contract to prepare the rig to
meet customer requirements. At times, we may be compensated by the customer for such work on either a lump-sum or dayrate basis. These fees are generally earned as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We
defer contract preparation fees received, as well as direct and incremental costs associated 
64 Table of Contents
with the contract preparation activities and amortize each, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts which we estimate to be benefited from the contract
preparation activity. From time to time, we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs on either a
lump-sum or dayrate basis. We defer such fees received in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize these fees into income on a straight-line basis over the period of the
related drilling contract. We capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement. 
We record reimbursements received for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the request of
our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement, for the gross amount billed to the customer, as Revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May
2014, the FASB, issued ASU No2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606, or ASU 2014-09. The new standard supersedes the industry-specific standards that currently exist under GAAP and provides a framework to address
revenue recognition issues comprehensively for all contracts with customers regardless of industry-specific or transaction-specific fact patterns. Under the new guidance, companies recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also provides for additional disclosure requirements. In July 2015, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The guidance of ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and may be
adopted using a retrospective or modified retrospective approach. 2. Asset Impairments 
2015 Impairments During 2015, in response to a continued deterioration of the market fundamentals in the oil and gas industry,
including the dramatic decline in oil prices, significant cutbacks in customer capital spending plans and contract cancelations by customers, as well as pending regulatory requirements in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, or GOM, we evaluated 25 of our
drilling rigs with indications that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable See Note 1. Using an undiscounted, projected probability-weighted cash flow analysis as described in Note 1, we determined that the carrying value of 17 of these
rigs, consisting of two ultra-deepwater, one deepwater and nine mid-water floaters and five jack-up rigs, were impaired collectively referred to as the 2015 Impaired Rigs. 
We estimated the fair value of 16 of the 2015 Impaired Rigs utilizing a market approach, which required us to estimate the value that would be
received for each rig in the principal or most advantageous market for that rig in an orderly transaction between market participants. Such estimates were based on various inputs, including historical contracted sales prices for similar rigs in our
fleet, nonbinding quotes from rig brokers and/or indicative bids, where applicable. We estimated the fair value of the one remaining 2015 Impaired Rig using an income approach, as we determined that the most likely use for this rig would be to cold
stack the rig and reintroduce it into the market at a later date. The fair value of this rig was estimated based on a calculation of the rigs discounted future net cash flows over its remaining economic life, which utilized significant
unobservable inputs, including, but not limited to, assumptions related to estimated dayrate revenue, rig utilization, estimated equipment upgrade and regulatory survey costs, as well as estimated proceeds that may be received on ultimate
disposition of the rig. Our fair value estimates are representative of Level 3 fair value measurements due to the significant level of estimation involved and the lack of transparency as to the inputs used. 
During the first, third and fourth quarters of 2015, we recognized impairment losses of $3585 million, $26 million and $4994 million,
respectively, for an aggregate impairment loss of $8604 million for the year ended December31, 2015. Of the 2015 Impaired Rigs, five mid-water rigs were sold during 2015. We are actively 
65 Table of Contents
marketing for sale the five jack-up rigs in the impairment group and have presented the $142 million aggregate carrying value of these rigs as Assets Held for Sale in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2015. Six of the 2015 Impaired Rigs were cold stacked at the end of 2015, and the remaining impaired rig is expected to be sold for scrap after completion of its contract in 2016. We have reported the
$1754 million aggregate carrying value of these rigs in Drilling and other property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2015, as they did not qualify for reporting as
assets held for sale. In February 2016, we sold one of our marketed-for-sale jack-up rigs for $80 million. 
If market fundamentals in the oil and gas industry deteriorate further or if we are unable to secure new or extend contracts for our current,
actively-marketed drilling fleet or reactivate any of our cold stacked rigs or if we experience unfavorable changes to our actual dayrates and rig utilization, we may be required to recognize additional impairment losses in future periods, if we are
unable to recover the carrying value of any of our drilling rigs. 2014 Impairments During the third quarter of 2014, we
initiated a plan to retire and scrap six mid-water drilling rigs. Using an undiscounted, projected probability-weighted cash flow analysis as described in Note 1, we determined that the carrying values of these six rigs were impaired, collectively
referred to as the 2014 Impaired Rigs. We determined the fair value of the 2014 Impaired Rigs by applying a combination of income and market approaches which were representative of Level 3 fair value measurements due to the significant level of
estimation involved and the lack of transparency as to the inputs used. As a result of our valuations, we recognized an impairment loss aggregating $1095 million during the third quarter of 2014. 
At December31, 2014, we had six additional rigs with indications that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We performed an
impairment analysis for each of these rigs using the methodology described in Note 1 and concluded that these rigs were not impaired at December31, 2014. 
During the fourth quarter of 2014, two of the 2014 Impaired Rigs were sold for scrap. The $94 million aggregate book value of the four
remaining 2014 Impaired Rigs was reported in Drilling and other property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2014. The remaining 2014 Impaired Rigs were sold in 2015.
We did not record an impairment loss during the year ended December31, 2013.

Represents the cost of 7,810 shares of common stock withheld to satisfy the payroll tax obligation incurred as a result of the vesting of restricted stock units in the first quarter of 2015. This cost is presented as a
deduction from stockholders equity in Treasury stock in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2015. 2
Interest payments, net of amounts capitalized, were $947 million, $732 million and $165 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
4. Stock-Based Compensation We have an
Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or Equity Plan, for our aemployees, bindependent contractors and cnon-employee directors, which is designed to encourage stock ownership by such persons, thereby aligning their interests
with those of our stockholders and to permit the payment of performance-based compensation as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Under the Equity Plan, we may grant both time-vesting and performance-vesting
awards, which are earned on the achievement of certain performance criteria. The following types of awards may be granted under the Equity Plan:  Stock options including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options;  Stock appreciation rights, or SARs;  Restricted stock;  Restricted stock units, or RSUs;  Performance shares or units; and  Other stock-based awards including dividend equivalents. A maximum of 7,500,000 shares of
our common stock is available for the grant or settlement of awards under the Equity Plan, subject to adjustment for certain business transactions and changes in capital structure. Vesting conditions and other terms and conditions of awards under
the Equity Plan are determined by our Board of Directors or the compensation committee of our Board of Directors, subject to the terms of the Equity Plan. RSUs may be issued with performance-vesting or time-vesting features. Except for RSUs issued
to our CEO, RSUs are not participating securities, and the holders of such awards have no right to receive regular dividends if or when declared. 
Total compensation cost recognized for all awards under the Equity Plan or its predecessor for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014
and 2013 was $57 million, $50 million and $39 million, respectively. Tax benefits recognized for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 related thereto were $19 million, 
68 Table of Contents
$14 million and $13 million, respectively. As of December31, 2015 there was $93 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards under the Equity Plan, which
we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of two years. Time-Vesting Awards 
SARs. SARs awarded under the Equity Plan generally vest ratably over a four-year period and expire in ten years. The exercise price per
share of SARs awarded under the Equity Plan may not be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair
value of SARs granted under the Equity Plan or its predecessor during each of the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was estimated using the Black Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: Year Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Expected life of SARs in years 6 7 7 Expected volatility 5512 2168 1824 Dividend yield 170 110 75 Risk free interest rate 166 208 161 The expected life of SARs is based on historical data as is the expected volatility. The dividend yield is
based on the current approved regular dividend rate in effect and the current market price at the time of grant. Risk free interest rates are determined using the U.S. Treasury yield curve at time of grant with a term equal to the expected life of
the SARs. A summary of SARs activity under the Equity Plan as of December31, 2015 and changes during the year then ended is as
follows:  Number ofAwards Weighted-AverageExercisePrice  TermYears  Awards outstanding at January1, 2015 1,587,330 7303 Granted 124,250 3167 Exercised Forfeited 42,901 5217 Expired 127,248 7207

The weighted-average grant date fair values per share of awards granted during the years ended
December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $1444, $1040 and $1374, respectively. The total intrinsic value of awards exercised during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $0, $169,000 and $162,000, respectively. The total
fair value of awards vested during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $36 million, $45 million and $41 million, respectively. 
Restricted Stock Units. RSUs are contractual rights to receive shares of our common stock in the future if the applicable vesting
conditions are met. In April 2015, we granted 153,493 time-vesting RSUs, one half of which will vest on April1, 2017 and the remaining 50% of which will vest on April1, 2018, conditioned upon continued employment through the applicable
vesting date. The fair value of time-vesting RSUs granted under the Equity Plan in 2015 was estimated based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, 
69 Table of Contents
discounted at a three-year risk-free interest rate of 148%, as consideration of the non-participative rights of the awards. 
A summary of activity for time-vesting RSUs under the Equity Plan as of December31, 2015 and changes during the year then ended is as

No time-vesting RSUs vested during the year ended December31, 2015. 
Performance-Vesting Awards Restricted
Stock Units. In April 2015, we granted an aggregate 169,312 in performance-vesting RSUs, which will vest upon achievement of certain performance goals as set forth in the individual award agreements over the performance period from
January1, 2015 to December31, 2017. The shares of our common stock to be received upon the vesting of the performance-vesting RSUs will be delivered no later than March15, 2018. The fair value of performance-vesting RSUs granted
under the Equity Plan to employees other than our CEO was estimated based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, discounted at a three-year risk-free interest rate of 148%. The fair value of performance-vesting RSUs
granted to our CEO in 2015 was not discounted as such awards are participating securities. In 2014, we awarded 55,661 targeted
performance RSUs, with a volume weighted average price of our common stock preceding the grant date of $4699 per share, including 3,080 in RSUs credited upon payment of cash dividends in 2014, to our CEO in connection with his commencement of
service with us in March 2014. The RSUs awarded to our CEO in 2014 will vest in one-third increments annually, over three years, commencing on the first anniversary of his hire date, conditioned upon continued employment through the applicable
vesting date. A summary of activity for performance-vesting RSUs under the Equity Plan as of December31, 2015 and changes during
the year then ended is as follows:  NumberofAwards Weighted-AverageGrantDateFair ValuePer Share Nonvested awards at January 1, 2015 55,661 4699 Granted 169,312 2619 Vested 18,617 4694 Forfeited

We report our investments in marketable securities as current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Marketable securities,
representing the investment of cash available for current operations. See Note 8. Our investments in marketable securities are classified
as available for sale and are summarized as follows:  December31, 2015 AmortizedCost UnrealizedGainLoss MarketValue In thousands Corporate bonds 16,480 5,042 11,438 Mortgage-backed securities 77 3 80

Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that the unrealized losses on our
investments in corporate bonds presented in the tables above are not indicative of the ultimate collectability of these investments, but are primarily related to the financial markets perception of the current downturn in the bond
issuers industry oil and gas market and contract drilling industry. We have no current intent to sell these securities, nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments prior to their maturity. Therefore, we
do not consider the unrealized losses at December31, 2015 and 2014 associated with our investments in corporate bonds to be other than temporary. 
Proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities and gross realized gains and losses are summarized as follows: Year Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 In thousands Proceeds from maturities 8,000,000 4,650,000 Proceeds from sales 51 57 85
Gross realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities for each of the three years ended
December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were not significant. 7. Derivative Financial Instruments 
Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts 
Our international operations expose us to foreign exchange risk associated with our costs payable in foreign currencies for employee
compensation, foreign income tax payments and purchases from foreign suppliers. From time to time, we may utilize FOREX contracts to manage our foreign exchange risk. Our FOREX contracts generally require us to net settle the spread between the
contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date, which, for most of our contracts, is the average spot rate for the contract period. 
We enter into FOREX contracts when we believe market conditions are favorable to purchase contracts for future settlement with the expectation
that such contracts, when settled, will reduce our exposure to foreign currency gains and losses on future foreign currency expenditures. The amount and duration of such contracts is based on our monthly forecast of expenditures in the significant
currencies in which we do business and for which there is a financial market. Historically we have entered into FOREX contracts for future delivery of Australian dollars, Brazilian reais, British pounds sterling, Mexican pesos and Norwegian kroner.
These forward contracts are derivatives as defined by GAAP. During the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we settled
FOREX contracts with aggregate notional values of approximately $916 million, $3047 million and $3074 million, respectively, of which the entire aggregate amounts were designated as an accounting hedge. During the years ended December31,
2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not enter into or settle any FOREX contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges. There were no FOREX contracts outstanding at December31, 2015. 
The following table presents the aggregate amount of gain or loss recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations related to our FOREX
contracts designated as hedging instruments for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.   For the Years Ended December31 Location of Gain Loss Recognized in Income

During the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not reclassify any amounts from AOCGL due
to the probability of an underlying forecasted transaction not occurring. 8. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Disclosures 
Concentrations of Credit and Market Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit or market risk consist primarily of periodic
temporary investments of excess cash, trade accounts receivable and investments in debt securities, including mortgage-backed securities. We generally place our excess cash investments in U.S. government backed short-term money market instruments
through several financial institutions. At times, such investments may be in excess of the insurable limit. We periodically evaluate the relative credit standing of these financial institutions as part of our investment strategy. 
Most of our investments in debt securities are securitized corporate bonds whereby our credit risk is mitigated by the collateral. However, we
are exposed to market risk due to price volatility associated with interest rate fluctuations. Concentrations of credit risk with respect
to our trade accounts receivable are limited primarily due to the entities comprising our customer base. Since the market for our services is the offshore oil and gas industry, this customer base consists primarily of major and independent oil and
gas companies and government-owned oil 
73 Table of Contents
companies. Based on our current customer base and the geographic areas in which we operate, as well as the number of rigs currently working in a geographic area, we do not believe that we have
any significant concentrations of credit risk at December31, 2015. In general, before working for a customer with whom we have not
had a prior business relationship and/or whose financial stability may be uncertain to us, we perform a credit review on that company. Based on that analysis, we may require that the customer present a letter of credit, prepay or provide other
credit enhancements. We record a provision for bad debts on a case-by-case basis when facts and circumstances indicate that a customer receivable may not be collectible and, historically, losses on our trade receivables have been infrequent
occurrences. During 2013, based on our assessment of the financial condition of two of our customers, Niko Resources Ltd., or Niko, and
OGX Petrleo e Gs Ltda. a privately owned Brazilian oil and natural gas company that filed for bankruptcy in October 2013, or OGX, and our expectations at the time regarding the probability of collection of amounts due to us from
them, we recorded $225 million in bad debt expense to fully reserve all outstanding receivables owed to us. In December 2013, we entered
into a settlement agreement with Niko, or the Niko Settlement, whereby Niko will be released from certain obligations under the dayrate contracts for the Ocean Monarch and Ocean Lexington, subject to and effective upon the full payment
of amounts owed to us under the Niko Settlement and subject to its other conditions. In accordance with the terms of the Niko Settlement, we received cash payments of $203 million during 2014 and $250 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, which
we recognized as revenue against invoices due us. Niko is further obligated to make future periodic payments to us pursuant to the Niko Settlement totaling an aggregate of $348 million, payable at various times through December 2016. In 2015, Niko
failed to make required payments and perform certain other obligations under the settlement agreement, so we filed suit seeking payment of the overdue amounts and requiring Niko to perform its other contractual obligations. We plan to recognize
these amounts in revenue as they are received due to the uncertainty regarding their timing and collection. In 2014, the creditors of
OGX, including us, agreed to a settlement whereby the creditors granted us shares of the reorganized OGX company in full settlement of obligations owed to them by OGX. As a result of the settlement, we have written off $212 million in receivables
due us from OGX against the associated allowance for bad debts, which was set up in 2013. See Note 3. Fair Values 
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prescribed by GAAP requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level1
Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 1 assets include short-term investments such as money market funds, U.S. Treasury Bills and Treasury notes. Our Level 1 assets at December31, 2015 consisted
of cash held in money market funds of $852 million and time deposits of $204 million. Our Level 1 assets at December31, 2014 consisted of cash held in money market funds of $1975 million and time deposits of $203 million. Level 2
Quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value
drivers are observable in active markets. Level 2 assets and liabilities include residential mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds purchased in a private placement offering and
74 Table of Contents over-the-counter FOREX contracts. Our residential mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds were valued using a model-derived valuation technique based on the quoted closing market prices received from a financial
institution. Our FOREX contracts were valued based on quoted market prices, which are derived from observable inputs including current spot and forward rates, less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The inputs used in our valuation
are obtained from a Bloomberg curve analysis which uses par coupon swap rates to calculate implied forward rates so that projected floating rate cash flows can be calculated. The valuation techniques underlying the models are widely accepted in the
financial services industry and do not involve significant judgment. Level 3
Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. Level 3 assets and liabilities generally include financial instruments whose value is determined
using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation or for which there is a lack of transparency as
to the inputs used. Our Level 3 assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted of nonrecurring measurements of certain of our drilling rigs for which we recorded an impairment loss during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Notes 1 and
2.
Market conditions could cause an instrument to be reclassified among Levels 1, 2 and 3. Our policy regarding
fair value measurements of financial instruments transferred into and out of levels is to reflect the transfers as having occurred at the beginning of the reporting period. There were no transfers between fair value levels during the years ended
December31, 2015 and 2014. Certain of our assets and liabilities are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis in
accordance with GAAP. In addition, certain assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Generally, we record assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. We recorded impairment
charges related to our 2015 Impaired Rigs and our 2014 Impaired Rigs, which were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and have presented the aggregate loss in Impairment of assets in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014.

were sold during 2015. We believe that the carrying amounts of our other financial assets and liabilities excluding
long-term debt, which are not measured at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, approximate fair value based on the following assumptions:  Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Accounts receivable and accounts payable The carrying amounts approximate fair value based on the nature of the instruments. Commercial paper The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 
We consider our senior notes, including current maturities, to be Level 2 liabilities under the GAAP fair value hierarchy and, accordingly,
the fair value of our senior notes was derived using a third-party pricing service at December31, 2015 and 2014. We perform control procedures over information we obtain from pricing services and brokers to test whether prices received
represent a reasonable estimate of fair value. These procedures include the review of pricing service or broker pricing methodologies and comparing fair value estimates to actual trade activity executed in the market for these instruments occurring
generally within a 10-day window of the report date. Fair values and related carrying values of our senior notes see Note 10 are shown below.

We have estimated the fair value amounts by using appropriate valuation methodologies and
information available to management. Considerable judgment is required in developing these estimates, and accordingly, no assurance can be given that the estimated values are indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a free market
exchange. 9. Drilling and Other Property and Equipment

The Ocean BlackLion was placed in service in June 2015 and is no longer reported as construction
work-in-progress at December31, 2015. See Note 12. 10. Credit Agreement and Senior Notes 
Credit Agreement We have a syndicated
revolving credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and swingline lender, which provides for a $15 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, or the Credit
Agreement. Effective October22, 2015, we entered into an extension agreement and fourth amendment to our Credit Agreement, which, among other things, provided for a one-year extension of the maturity date for most of the lenders. As so
extended, our Credit Agreement matures on October22, 2020, except for $40 million of commitments that mature on March17, 2019 and $60 million of commitments that mature on October22, 2019. In addition, we also have the option to
increase the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $500 million from time to time, upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders, and to request one additional one-year extension of the
77 Table of Contents
maturity date. The entire amount of the facility is available, subject to its terms, for revolving loans. Up to $250 million of the facility may be used for the issuance of performance or other
standby letters of credit and up to $100 million may be used for swingline loans. At December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. 
Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum based on either an alternate base rate, or ABR,
or a Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus the applicable interest margin for an ABR loan or a Eurodollar loan. The ABR is the greatest of ithe prime rate, iithe federal funds rate plus 050% and iiithe
daily one-month Eurodollar Rate plus 100%. The applicable interest margin for ABR loans varies from 0% to 025%. The applicable interest margin for Eurodollar loans varies between 075% and 125%. Based on our current credit ratings, the applicable
interest margin is 0125% for ABR loans and 1125% for Eurodollar loans. Swingline loans bear interest, at our option, at a rate per
annum equal to ithe ABR plus the applicable interest margin for ABR loans or iithe daily one-month Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable interest margin for Eurodollar loans. 
Under our Credit Agreement, we also pay, based on our current long-term credit ratings, and as applicable, other customary fees including, but
not limited to, a commitment fee on the unused commitments under the Credit Agreement, varying between 006% and 020%per annum, and a fronting fee to the issuing bank for each letter of credit. Participation fees for letters of credit are
dependent upon the type of letter of credit issued, varying between 0375% and 0625%per annum for performance letters of credit, and between 075% and 125%per annum for all other letters of credit. Based on our current credit ratings,
the applicable commitment fee is 015%, and the participation fee for letters of credit is 05625%. Changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the fees that we pay under the Credit Agreement. 
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants including, but not limited to, maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total
capitalization, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of not more than 60% at the end of each fiscal quarter, as well as limitations on liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidation and dissolution; changes in lines of business; swap agreements;
transactions with affiliates; and subsidiary indebtedness. As of December31, 2015, we were in compliance with all covenant requirements. 
At December31, 2015 and 2014, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of February16, 2016, we had $3050
million in Eurodollar loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement and an additional $12 billion available. Commercial Paper 
In 2015, we established a commercial paper program with four commercial paper dealers pursuant to which we may issue, on a private placement
basis, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $15 billion and, unless we change the terms of the program, the aggregate amount of commercial paper notes and total loans and letters of credit
outstanding under the Credit Agreement at any time will not exceed $15 billion. Proceeds from issuances under the commercial paper program may be used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the notes may vary, but may not exceed 397 days
from the date of issuance. The notes will be issued, at our option, either at a discounted price to their principal face value or will bear interest, which may be at a fixed or floating rate, at rates that will vary based on market conditions and
the ratings assigned by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance. The notes are not redeemable or subject to voluntary prepayment by us prior to maturity. Liquidity for our payment obligations in respect of the notes issued under the
commercial paper program is provided under our Credit Agreement, and the aggregate amount of notes outstanding at any time will not exceed the amount available under the Credit Agreement. 
As of December31, 2015, we had $2866 million in commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 086% and a
weighted average remaining term of 58 days. As of February16, 2016, there were no commercial paper notes outstanding.

12. Commitments and Contingencies 
Various claims have been filed against us in the ordinary course of business, including claims by offshore workers alleging personal injuries.
With respect to each claim or exposure, we have made an assessment, in accordance with GAAP, of the probability that the resolution of the matter would ultimately result in a loss. When we determine that an unfavorable resolution of a matter is
probable and such amount of loss can be determined, we record a liability for the amount of the estimated loss at the time that both of these criteria are met. Our management believes that we have recorded adequate accruals for any liabilities that
may reasonably be expected to result from these claims. Asbestos Litigation. We are one of several unrelated defendants in
lawsuits filed in Mississippi, Louisiana and Missouri state courts alleging that defendants manufactured, distributed or utilized drilling mud containing asbestos and, in our case, allowed such drilling mud to have been utilized aboard our offshore
drilling rigs. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, an award of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. The manufacture and use of asbestos-containing drilling mud had already ceased before we acquired any of the drilling rigs addressed
in these lawsuits. We believe that we are not liable for the damages asserted and we expect to receive complete defense and indemnity from Murphy Exploration Production Company with respect to many of the lawsuits pursuant to the terms of
our 1992 asset purchase agreement with them. We also believe that we are not liable for the damages asserted in the remaining lawsuits pursuant to the terms of our 1989 asset purchase agreement with Diamond M Corporation, and we filed a declaratory
judgment action in Texas state court against NuStar Energy LP, or NuStar, and Kaneb Management Co., L.L.C., or Kaneb, the successors to Diamond M Corporation, seeking a judicial determination that we did not assume liability for these claims. We are
unable to estimate our potential exposure, if any, to these lawsuits at this time but do not believe that our ultimate liability, if any, resulting from this litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows. Other Litigation. We have been named in various other claims, lawsuits or threatened actions that are
incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including a claim by Petrobras that it will seek to recover from its contractors, including us, any taxes, penalties, interest and fees that it must pay to the Brazilian tax authorities for our
applicable portion of withholding taxes related to Petrobras charter agreements with its contractors. We intend to defend these matters vigorously; however, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the ultimate outcome or effect of these
claims, lawsuits and actions cannot be predicted with certainty. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these matters. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not  81 Table of Contents
could cause us to incur costs and expenses, require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. In the opinion of our management, no
pending or known threatened claims, actions or proceedings against us are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
NPI Arrangement. We received customer payments measured by a percentage net profits interest primarily of 27% under an overriding
royalty interest in certain developmental oil-and-gas producing properties, or NPI, which we believe is a real property interest. Our drilling program related to the NPI was completed in 2011, and the balance of the amounts due to us under the NPI
was received in 2013. However, the customer that conveyed the NPI to us filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in August 2012. Certain parties including the debtor in the bankruptcy proceedings
questioned whether our NPI, and certain amounts we received under it since the filing of the bankruptcy, should be included in the debtors estate under the bankruptcy proceeding. In 2013, we filed a declaratory judgment action in the
bankruptcy court seeking a declaration that our NPI, and payments that we received from it since the filing of the bankruptcy, are not part of the bankruptcy estate. We agreed to a settlement with the company that purchased most of the debtors
assets including the debtors claims against our NPI whereby the nature of our NPI will not be challenged by that party and our declaratory judgment action was dismissed. Following the settlement, the bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7
liquidation proceeding. Several lienholders who had previously intervened in the declaratory judgment action filed motions in the bankruptcy contending that their liens have priority and seeking disgorgement of $325 million of payments made to us
after the bankruptcy was filed. We believe that our rights to the payments at issue are superior to these liens, and we have filed appropriate motions to dismiss these claims. In addition, the bankruptcy trustee filed counterclaims seeking
disgorgement of a total of $300 million of pre- and post-bankruptcy payments made to us under the original NPI. We have filed motions to dismiss these counterclaims and still expect the bankruptcy proceedings to be concluded with no further
material impact to us. Personal Injury Claims. Under our current insurance policies, our deductibles for marine liability
insurance coverage, including personal injury claims, which primarily result from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, are $250 million for the first occurrence, with no aggregate deductible, and vary in amounts ranging between $50 million
and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $1000 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims that might arise during the policy year. 
The Jones Act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel
and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work-related injury or death of an employee. We engage outside consultants to assist us in estimating our aggregate liability for personal injury claims based on our
historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models. We allocate a portion of the aggregate liability to Accrued liabilities based on an estimate of claims expected to be paid within the next twelve months with the residual recorded
as Other liabilities. At December31, 2015 our estimated liability for personal injury claims was $404 million, of which $82 million and $322 million were recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other
liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December31, 2014, our estimated liability for personal injury claims was $394 million, of which $82 million and $312 million were recorded in Accrued
liabilities and Other liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as: the severity of personal injuries claimed;  significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims;  the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated;  inconsistent court decisions; and  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation.

Purchase Obligations. The Ocean GreatWhite, a 10,000 foot dynamically positioned,
harsh environment semisubmersible drilling rig, is under construction in South Korea at an estimated cost of $764 million, including shipyard costs, capital spares, commissioning, project management and shipyard supervision. The contracted price to
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. totaling $6285 million is payable in two installments, of which the first installment of $1886 million has been paid. The final installment of $4399 million is due upon delivery of the rig, which is expected to
occur in mid-2016. At December31, 2015, we had no other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant
obligations, except for those related to our direct rig operations, which arise during the normal course of business. Operating
Leases. We lease office and yard facilities, housing, equipment and vehicles under operating leases, which expire at various times through the year 2018. Total rent expense amounted to $78 million, $106 million and $135 million for the years
ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Future minimum rental payments under leases are approximately $27 million, $13 million and $04 million for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. There are no minimum future rental
payments under operating leases after 2018. Letters of Credit and Other. We were contingently liable as of December31, 2015
in the amount of $716 million under certain performance, supersedeas, bid, tax and customs bonds and letters of credit. Agreements relating to approximately $640 million of performance, tax, supersedeas, court and customs bonds can require
collateral at any time. As of December31, 2015, we had not been required to make any collateral deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require collateral except in events of default. On our behalf, banks
have issued letters of credit securing certain of these bonds. 
13. Related-Party Transactions 
Transactions with Loews. We are party to a services agreement with Loews, or the Services Agreement, pursuant to
which Loews performs certain administrative and technical services on our behalf. Such services include personnel, internal auditing, accounting, and cash management services, in addition to advice and assistance with respect to preparation of tax
returns and obtaining insurance. Under the Services Agreement, we are required to reimburse Loews for iallocated personnel costs such as salaries, employee benefits and payroll taxes of the Loews personnel actually providing such services
and iiall out-of-pocket expenses related to the provision of such services. The Services Agreement may be terminated at our option upon 30 days notice to Loews and at the option of Loews upon six months notice to us. In addition,
we have agreed to indemnify Loews for all claims and damages arising from the provision of services by Loews under the Services Agreement unless due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Loews. We were charged $13 million, $11 million
and $10 million by Loews for these support functions during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
Transactions with Other Related Parties. We hire marine vessels and helicopter transportation services at the prevailing market rate
from subsidiaries of SEACOR Holdings Inc. and Era Group Inc. The Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of SEACOR Holdings Inc. and the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Era Group Inc. is also a member of our Board of
Directors. We paid $60 million, $08 million and $01 million for the hire of such vessels and such services during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
The wife of our former President and Chief Executive Officer was an audit partner at Ernst Young LLP, or EY, during his term
of service with us. For the year ended December31, 2014, we made payments aggregating $29 million to EY for tax and other consulting services; however, EY ceased to be a related party on March3, 2014. For the year ended
December31, 2013, we made payments to EY of $16 million. 
83 Table of Contents 14. Restructuring and Separation Costs 
During 2015, in response to the continuing decline in the offshore drilling market, we reviewed our cost and organization
structure, and, as a result, our management approved and initiated a reduction in workforce at our onshore bases and corporate facilities, also referred to as the Corporate Reduction Plan. As of December31, 2015, appropriate communications had
been made to substantially all impacted personnel, and we paid $98 million in restructuring and employee separation related costs during 2015. There were no accrued costs associated with the Corporate Reduction Plan as of December31, 2015.
15. Income Taxes 
Our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre-tax earnings or losses, as well
as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Certain of our international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Foreign Asset Company, or DFAC, a Cayman Islands subsidiary that we own. It is our
intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of DFAC and its foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities. Accordingly, we have not made a provision for U.S. income taxes on approximately $20 billion of undistributed foreign earnings
and profits. Although we do not intend to repatriate the earnings of our foreign subsidiary, and have not provided U.S. income taxes for such earnings, except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to U.S. income taxes, these
earnings could become subject to U.S. income tax if remitted, or if deemed remitted as a dividend; however, it is not practical to estimate this potential liability.

In 2015, we adopted ASU 2015-17, as allowed by the standard. In order to reduce the complexity of our financial statements we are no longer separating deferred income liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent
classifications. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted and accordingly, at December31, 2014, $156 million was reflected in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Notes 1 and 3.

asset of $1432 million for the benefit of NOL carryforwards; $493 million related to our U.S. losses and $939 million related to our international operations. Approximately $286 million of this deferred tax asset relates to NOL carryforwards
that have an indefinite life. The remaining $1146 million relates to NOL carryforwards of our subsidiaries in Mexico, Hungary and the United States. Unless utilized, tax benefits of NOL carryforwards will expire between 2020 and 2035 as follows:

Unrecognized Tax Benefits. Our income tax returns are subject to review and examination in the various
jurisdictions in which we operate and we are currently contesting various tax assessments. We accrue for income tax contingencies, or uncertain tax positions, that we believe are more likely than not exposures. A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, gross of tax carryforwards and excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:  For the Year Ended December31 2015 2014 2013 In thousands Balance, beginning of period 57,116 90,921 67,150 Additions for current year tax positions 7,013 5,813 1,724 Additions for prior year tax positions 82 292 31,264 Reductions for prior year tax positions 2,673 34,630 7,280 Reductions related to statute of limitation expirations 7,586 5,280 1,937

At December31, 2015, $28 million, $19 million and $503 million of the net liability for uncertain tax
positions were reflected in Other assets, Deferred tax liability and Other liabilities, respectively. At December31, 2014, $49 million and $554 million of the net liability for uncertain tax positions were
reflected in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively. Of the net unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, all $494 million, $505 million and $763 million, respectively, would affect the
effective tax rates if recognized. The following table presents the amount of accrued interest and penalties at December31, 2015
and 2014 related to uncertain tax positions:  December31 2015 2014 In thousands Uncertain tax positions net, excluding interest and penalties 49,380 50,513 Accrued interest on uncertain tax positions 2,743 7,503 Accrued penalties on uncertain tax positions 39,924 37,622

We record interest related to accrued uncertain tax positions in interest expense and recognize

In several of the international locations in which we operate, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries enter
into agreements with other of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to provide specialized services and equipment in support of our foreign operations. We apply a transfer pricing methodology to determine the amount to be charged for providing the services
and equipment. In most cases, there are alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied to these transactions and, if applied, could result in different chargeable amounts. Taxing authorities in the various foreign locations in
which we operate could apply one of the alternative transfer pricing methodologies which could result in an increase to our income tax liabilities with respect to tax returns that remain subject to examination. 
We expect the statute of limitations for the 2010 tax year to expire in 2016 for one of our subsidiaries operating in Mexico, and we
anticipate that the related unrecognized tax benefit will decrease by $07 million at that time. Tax Returns and Examinations. We
file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. Tax years that remain subject to examination by these jurisdictions include years 2009 to 2015. We are currently under audit in
several of these jurisdictions. We do not anticipate that any adjustments resulting from the tax audit of any of these years will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
U.S. Jurisdiction. Our 2013 tax year is currently under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. 
Brazil Tax Jurisdiction. In December 2009, we received an assessment of approximately $260 million for the years 2004 and 2005, including
interest and penalty. We contested the tax assessment in 2010 and, during the third quarter of 2014, received a favorable court decision resulting in the closure of the 2004 and 2005 tax years. As a consequence, we reversed our $140 million reserve
for this uncertain tax position, of which $35 million was interest and $44 million was penalty. In March 2013, the Brazilian tax
authorities began an audit of our income tax returns for the years 2009 and 2010. The tax audit is still ongoing. In February 2012, the
tax authorities concluded their audit of our income tax return for the 2007 tax year for which we received an assessment of approximately $171 million for income tax, including interest and penalties. We contested the assessment and a court in
Brazil ruled to cancel the assessment. However, the Brazilian tax authorities have appealed the ruling, and we are awaiting the outcome of the appeal. We have not accrued any tax expense related to this assessment. 
In addition, the Brazilian tax authorities have issued an assessment for the 2000 tax year of approximately $15 million, including interest
and penalty. We have appealed the tax assessment and are awaiting the outcome of the appeal. Egypt Tax Jurisdiction. During 2013, we were
under audit by the Egyptian tax authorities for the tax years 2006 through 2010. In 2013, after receiving notification that the Egyptian government had concluded the income 
89 Table of Contents
tax audit for the period 2006 to 2008 and proposed a $12 billion increase to taxable income, we accrued an additional $569 million of expense for uncertain tax positions in Egypt for all open
years. During the first quarter of 2014, we settled certain disputes for the years 2006 through 2008 with the Egyptian tax authorities, which resulted in an aggregate $172 million reduction in tax expense, comprised of a $232 million reversal of
uncertain tax positions, partially offset by $60 million in current foreign income tax expense. One issue for the 2006 through 2008 period remains open, which we appealed. Our court case is scheduled to occur in the first quarter of 2016. We have
sought assistance from an agency of the U.S. Treasury Department, pursuant to international tax treaties, and continue to believe that our position will, more likely than not, be sustained. However, if our position is not sustained, tax expense and
related penalties would increase by approximately $53 million related to this issue for the 2006 through 2008 tax years as of December31, 2015. 
We are currently also under audit by the Egyptian tax authorities for the tax years 2009 through 2012. 
Malaysia Tax Jurisdiction. During the third quarter of 2014, we received final approval from the Malaysian tax authorities for the settlement
of tax liabilities and penalties for the years 2003 through 2008 resulting in the reversal of a $142 million reserve for uncertain tax positions for these years, of which $53 million was penalty. 
Mexico Tax Jurisdiction. During the year ended December31, 2015, the statute of limitations for the 2008 tax year related to an
uncertain tax position expired and we reversed our $38 million tax accrual, of which $13 million was interest and $05 million was penalty. In addition, the statute of limitations for the 2009 tax year related to an uncertain tax position expired,
and we reversed our $107 million tax accrual, of which $36 million was interest and $14 million was penalty. In August 2015, the
Mexican tax authorities completed an audit for the 2008 tax year for one of our subsidiaries operating in Mexico and issued an assessment in the amount of $53 million, including interest and penalty. We have appealed the tax assessment and are
awaiting the outcome of the appeal. We have not accrued any tax expense related to this assessment. In June 2015, the Mexican tax authorities initiated an audit of the 2009 income tax return of one of our other subsidiaries operating in Mexico. 
Due to the 2014 expiration of the statute of limitations in Mexico for the 2008 tax year for one of our subsidiaries operating in Mexico, we
reversed our $80 million accrual for an uncertain tax position, of which $27 million was interest and $11 million was penalty, during the year ended December31, 2014. 
The tax authorities in Mexico previously audited our income tax returns for the years 2004 and 2006 and had issued assessments for tax years
2004 and 2006 of approximately $229 million and $244 million, respectively, including interest and penalties, which we had appealed. In 2013 the Mexican tax authorities initiated a tax amnesty program whereby income tax assessments, including
penalties and interest, could be partially or completely waived. Under the tax amnesty, we were able to settle our tax liabilities for the years 2004 and 2006 for a net cash cost of $37 million. As a result of increases in uncertain tax positions
for later years, we recorded an additional $132 million of expense, including $50 million of interest and $27 million of penalties, during the year ended December31, 2013. 
Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in Mexico for the 2007 tax year, during the second quarter of 2013, we reversed our $43
million accrual for this uncertain tax position, of which $15 million was interest and $06 million was penalty. Australia Jurisdiction.
We are currently under audit for tax years 2010 through 2013. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief
Act of 2012, or the Act, was signed into law on January2, 2013. The Act extended through 2013 several expired or expiring temporary business provisions, commonly referred to as extenders, which were retroactively extended to the
beginning of 2012. As 
90 Table of Contents
required by GAAP, the effects of new legislation are recognized when signed into law. Consequently, we reduced our 2013 tax expense by $275 million as a result of recognizing the 2012 effect of
the extenders. 16. Employee Benefit Plans 
Defined Contribution Plans We maintain
defined contribution retirement plans for our U.S., U.K. and third-country national, or TCN, employees. The plan for our U.S. employees, or the 401k Plan, is designed to qualify under Section401k of the Code. Under the 401k Plan, each
participant may elect to defer taxation on a portion of his or her eligible earnings, as defined by the 401k Plan, by directing his or her employer to withhold a percentage of such earnings. A participating employee may also elect to make after-tax
contributions to the 401k Plan. During each of the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we matched up to 6% of each employees compensation contributed to the 401k Plan. During the four months ended April30, 2015 and the
years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, we made discretionary profit sharing contributions of 4% of a participants defined compensation to the 401k Plan. We ceased making profit sharing contributions under the 401k Plan on May1,
2015. Participants are fully vested in the employer match immediately upon enrollment in the 401k Plan and subject to a three-year cliff vesting period for any profit sharing contribution. For the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,
our provision for contributions was $238 million, $341 million and $296 million, respectively. The defined contribution retirement
plan for our U.K. employees provides that we make annual contributions in an amount equal to the employees contributions generally up to a maximum percentage of the employees defined compensation per year. For each of the years ended
December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our contribution for employees working in the U.K. sector of the North Sea was up to a maximum of 10%, of the employees defined compensation. Our provision for contributions was $34 million, $50 million
and $35 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The defined contribution retirement plan for
our TCN employees, or International Savings Plan, is similar to the 401k Plan. During each of the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we matched up to 6% of each employees compensation contributed to the International Savings
Plan. During the four months ended April30, 2015 and the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013, we made discretionary profit sharing contributions of 4% of a participants defined compensation to the International Savings Plan. We
ceased making profit sharing contributions under this plan on May1, 2015. Our provision for contributions was $22 million, $37 million and $31 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
Deferred Compensation and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
Our Amended and Restated Diamond Offshore Management Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, or Supplemental Plan, provides benefits to
a select group of our management or other highly compensated employees to compensate such employees for any portion of our base salary contribution and/or matching contribution under the 401k Plan that could not be contributed to that plan because
of limitations within the Code. Our provision for contributions to the Supplemental Plan for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $153,000, $265,000 and $261,000, respectively. 
17. Segments and Geographic Area Analysis 
Although we provide contract drilling services with different types of offshore drilling rigs and also provide such services
in many geographic locations, we have aggregated these operations into one reportable segment based on the similarity of economic characteristics due to the nature of the revenue earning process as it relates to the offshore drilling industry over
the operating lives of our drilling rigs.

The following table presents our long-lived tangible assets by geographic location as of
December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. A substantial portion of our assets is comprised of rigs that are mobile, and therefore asset locations at the end of the period are not necessarily indicative of the geographic distribution of the earnings
generated by such assets during the periods and may vary from period to period due to the relocation of rigs. In circumstances where our drilling rigs were in transit at the end of a calendar year, they have been presented in the tables below within
the geographic area in which they were expected to operate.  December31 2015 1 2014 2013 In thousands Drilling and other property and equipment, net United States 2 3,292,474 2,637,621 611,731 International Australia/Asia/Middle East

During the first, third and fourth quarters of 2015, we recognized impairment losses of $3585 million, $26 million and $4994 million, respectively, aggregating $8604 million for the year ended December31, 2015
to write down certain of our drilling rigs with indicators of impairment to their estimated recoverable amounts. See Notes 1 and 2. 19.
Subsequent Event In February 2016, we entered into a ten-year agreement with GE Oil Gas, or GE, to provide services with
respect to certain blowout preventer and related well control equipment on our four newbuild drillships. Such services include management of maintenance, certification and reliability with respect to such equipment. In connection with the services
agreement with GE, we will sell the equipment to a GE affiliate for an aggregate $2100 million and will lease back such equipment over separate ten-year operating leases. We do not expect to realize any gain or loss on these sale and leaseback
transactions. Future commitments for the full term under the services agreement and leases are estimated to aggregate approximately $6500 million.

Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
reports that we file or submit under the federal securities laws, including this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us under the federal securities laws is accumulated and communicated to our management on a timely basis to allow decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, participated in an evaluation by our management of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e as of December31, 2015. Based on their participation in that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of December31, 2015. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f for Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published
financial statements. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system, however well designed, including the
possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Management must make judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control measure. The design of a control system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments made by management about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective under all potential future conditions. As a result, even an effective system of internal controls can provide no more than reasonable assurance with respect
to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared. Our management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in
Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013. Based on this assessment our management believes that, as of December31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
Deloitte Touche LLP, the registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report of Deloitte Touche LLP is included at the beginning of Item8 of this Form 10-K. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the foregoing evaluation that occurred
during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
