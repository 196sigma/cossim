Item8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Management of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  
The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and 3
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2006. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework. Based on the assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that
the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited and issued their report on
managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, and the report
is set forth in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm which is included
below. 50 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation We have completed integrated audits of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporations consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation and its subsidiaries
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation at December31, 2006 and 2005 and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporations management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation
changed its method of accounting for defined benefit and postretirement plans in 2006. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
COSO. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporations management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporations
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal
control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial
reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable 51 Table of Contents assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Nature of Business   
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation the Company manufactures and sells hot rolled, cold rolled,
galvanized, pre-painted and tin mill sheet products. The Company also manufactures fabricated
steel products, including roll-formed corrugated roofing, roof deck, form deck, floor deck,
bridgeform and other products used primarily in construction, highway and agricultural markets.   
Bankruptcy and Reorganization   
The Company emerged from bankruptcy effective August1, 2003 and applied fresh start reporting
as of
July31, 2003 pursuant to Statement of Position SOP90-7, Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code.   
Principles of Consolidation   
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all companies more
than 50% owned. The Company also evaluates the consolidation of entities under Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No46 revised December2003, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities FIN 46R which requires the Company to evaluate whether an entity
is a variable interest entity and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the variable
interest entity. Pursuant to FIN 46R, the consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Mountain State Carbon, LLC, an entity in which the Company has a 50% voting interest
see Note 16.   
All material inter-company accounts, balances and transactions have been eliminated. The
Company uses the equity method of accounting to account for investments in unconsolidated
companies more than 20% owned. Unrealized profits or losses on sales to unconsolidated
companies accounted for using the equity method of accounting have been eliminated.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents   
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and highly liquid debt instruments
with maturities of three months or less. Cash that is restricted for use to fund capital
expenditures is reflected as a non-current asset. At December 31, 2006, $11,159 in cash and cash equivalents was internally restricted for joint venture activities and was not available for
general purposes.   
Accounts Receivable   
Accounts receivable are stated at net invoice amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts.
The Company provides a specific allowance for doubtful accounts for certain amounts remaining
unpaid beyond normal customer payment periods and provides a general allowance for doubtful
accounts based on historical loss experience. All amounts deemed to be uncollectible are
charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which the determination is
made. Bad debt expense for 2006 and 2005 amount to $475 and $523, respectively.   
Inventory   
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last-in,
first-out LIFOmethod for substantially all inventories. At December31, 2006 and 2005,
approximately 96% and 94%, respectively, of all inventories were valued using the LIFO method.
Cost is determined for non-LIFO inventories based on actual cost using the first-in, first-out
FIFOmethod.   
Property, Plant and Equipment   
Property, plant and equipment acquired subsequent to July31, 2003 is recorded at cost.
Property, plant and equipment acquired prior to August1, 2003, was recorded at fair value as of
August1, 2003 as a result of the application of fresh start reporting. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of 40years for real
property and estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30years for machinery and equipment.
Betterments and improvements are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are
expensed as 57 Table of Contents   
incurred.Gains and losses from the sale of property, plant and equipment are
recorded as cost of goods sold. Interest costs incurred to construct property, plant and
equipment are capitalized.   
The Company periodically evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability is determined based on an estimate of the expected future undiscounted cash
flows of the assets. If the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of
the assets, an impairment loss is recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the excess of
the carrying value of the assets over the fair value of the assets. Fair value is estimated
using discounted future cash flows and, if available, comparable market values. Considering the
Companys integrated operations, asset impairment evaluations are performed on a group basis,
which represents the lowest level of independent cash flows.   
Software Costs   
Costs incurred for the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized and
amortized over the useful life of the software, which is generally five years or less.   
Income Taxes   
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets, including tax loss and tax
credit carryforwards, and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period in which enactment
occurs. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities. The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are
individually classified as current and non-current based on their characteristics. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.   
Under the provisions of SOP 90-7, the benefit of pre-confirmation net operating loss
carryforwards or any benefit resulting from the reversal of a valuation allowance applicable to
other deferred tax assets are used first to reduce recorded goodwill, then to reduce other
intangible assets and finally to increase additional paid-in capital see Note 12.   
Intangible Assets   
The carrying value of intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed for impairment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the intangible
assets may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability is determined based on an estimate of the
expected future undiscounted cash flows of the intangible assets. If the carrying value of the
intangible assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the intangible assets, an impairment
loss is recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the
intangible assets over the fair value of the intangible assets. Fair value is estimated using a
discounted cash flow model. The Company has no intangible assets with an indefinite useful
life.   
Deferred Financing Costs   
Costs incurred to obtain, extend or amend debt obligations are capitalized and amortized over
the term of the related obligation.   
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits   
The Company maintains a defined benefit pension plan for all salaried employees employed as of
January31, 1998. The Company also maintains defined benefit retiree health care and life
insurance plans that provide benefits for substantially all salaried employees and for hourly
employees retiring after October1, 2003. The net pension and other postretirement benefits
obligations recorded and the related periodic benefit costs are based on, among other things,
assumptions of discount rates, estimated returns on plan assets, salary increases, mortality
rates and future health care medical trend rates. Actuarial techniques and assumptions are used
to estimate these obligations and the related periodic benefit costs.   
The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No158 as of December31, 2006 see Note 17. 58 Table of Contents   
Asset Retirement Obligations   
An asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets is recognized
when a liability is incurred and the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
If fair value cannot be determined in the period in which the liability is incurred, a liability
is recognized when a reasonable estimation of fair value can be made. Fair value is based on
quoted market prices or the best information available in the circumstances.   
The Company may incur asset retirement obligations in the event of a permanent plant shutdown.
At December31, 2006, the Companys plant assets had indeterminate lives and a reasonable estimate
of the fair value of associated asset retirement obligations could not be made.   
Revenue Recognition   
Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title, ownership and risk of loss is
transferred to the customer, which coincides with the time such products are shipped.
Prepayments for products to be delivered in future periods are recorded as deferred revenue
until shipment occurs and title, ownership and risk of loss passes to the customer. Shipping
costs billed to customers are recorded as revenues.   
Environmental Expenditures   
Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not
contribute to future revenues are expensed. Environmental expenditures that extend the life of
related property, increase the value of related property or mitigate or prevent future
contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
estimated. Accruals for environmental obligations are not reduced by claims, if any, for
recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties until it is probable that such
recoveries will be realized.   
Stock-based Payments   
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004 FASB No.
123R in 2005 and accounts for all share-based payment transactions using a fair-value-based
measurement method. The Company elected to apply this statement using the modified
retrospective method see Note 5.   
Earnings lossper Share   
Basic earnings lossper share is computed by dividing net earnings lossapplicable to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings lossper share is computed by dividing net earnings loss
attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents. In periods where losses are
reported, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock
equivalents, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.   
Use of Estimates   
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from the estimates and assumptions made.   
Concentrations of Credit and Business Risk   
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by customers, principally steel
service centers, converters and processors and customers in the construction and container
industries, substantially all of which are located in the United States. The Company mitigates
its exposure to credit risk by performing on-going credit evaluations and obtaining security as
appropriate.   
During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company had sales to one customer, an affiliate, which
approximated
141%, 139% and 175% of revenue, respectively. 59 Table of Contents   
New Accounting Standards   
The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards FASBNo158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans and Other
Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R, in September
2006. FASB No158 requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the
statement of financial position; requires the recognition of the gains or losses and prior
service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of
net periodic pension cost as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax; requires the
measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the fiscal year-end date; and
requires additional footnote disclosure about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for

expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2006. The Company has not yet quantified the effect of FIN 48 on its financial
statements.   
The FASB issued FASB No155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an
Amendment of FASB Statements No133 and 140, in February2006. FASB No155 eliminates the
exemption from applying FASB No133 to interests in securitized financial assets and allows for
fair value measurement at acquisition, at issuance or on re-measurement on an

Compensation expense under these plans is measured as being equal to the fair value of the
common stock issued on the grant date, amortized over the vesting period for each grant.
Compensation expense related to these plans amounted to $1,609, $2,687 and $2,471 for 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. The total fair value of shares vested during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was

retirement eligible provisions.   
Stock options   
The Company maintains a stock option plan for non-employee directors of the Company pursuant to
which it granted stock options for 22,755, 25,389 and 19,215 shares of its common stock during
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, at a weighted average exercise price of $1974, $1665 and
$2199 per share, respectively. The options were granted at a price equal to the average stock
price for a five-day period ending on the date of grant, vest upon receipt, are exercisable at
the option of the holder and lapse ten years from the date of grant. If a non-employee director
of the Company terminates association with the Company, outstanding stock options are
exercisable within 90days from the date of such termination. During 2006, proceeds of $262
were received from the exercise of 28,965 stock options. No stock options were exercised during
2005 and 2004.   
The grant date fair value of stock options granted under the plan is estimated using the
Black-Scholes pricing model. The weighted average grant date fair value for stock options
granted during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
$1434, $1304 and $1905 per option, respectively, determined using the following assumptions

The Company previously used a ten-year expected life assumption relative to stock options,
which was equal to the term of the stock options issued. During 2006, the Company changed this
expected life assumption to five years, which is a simple average of the vesting period and the
term of the stock options issued. The effect of this change on previously reported amounts was
not material. 62 Table of Contents

2009, respectively, and 56,997, 57,000 and 57,003 on December19, 2007, 2008 and 2009,
respectively. Stock unit performance awards will vest to each individual in full, subject to
forfeiture, on March31, 2009, based on a combination of service and market performance. In
general, market performance will be determined based on a comparison of the annualized total
shareholder return of the Companys stock, as defined by the plan, as compared to the percentage
increase in the Dow Jones US Steel Index over the three-year period ending December31, 2008.
Based on market performance as measured against predetermined targets, as defined by the plan,
all, a portion or none of these stock unit performance awards may vest to each individual on
March31, 2009. Each stock unit award is equivalent to one share of common stock of the
Company. The Company, at its sole discretion, has the option of settling stock unit awards in
cash or by issuing common stock or a combination of both. No stock unit awards granted under
the plan vested during 2006. No stock unit awards granted under this plan are subject to
retirement eligible provisions.   
The grant date fair value of stock unit service awards is measured as being equal to the fair
value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair
value of stock unit service awards granted during 2006 was $1841 per stock unit service award.
The grant date fair value of stock unit performance awards is estimated using a lattice-based
valuation model. The grant date fair value of stock unit performance awards granted during 2006
was $2167 per stock unit performance award, determined using the following assumptions

Investment in and Advances to Affiliates   
The Company owns 357% of the outstanding common stock of Wheeling-Nisshin, 50% of the
outstanding common stock of OCC, 49% of the outstanding common stock of Feralloy-Wheeling
Specialty Processing, Co. and a 50% interest in Jensen Bridge, all of which are accounted for
using the equity method of accounting. The carrying value of the Companys investment in
affiliates was $47,960 and $47,400 at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   
As a result of the application of fresh start reporting, the Company restated its investment in
affiliates to fair value as July31, 2003. At December31, 2006, the Companys interest in the
net assets of its affiliates accounted for using the equity method of accounting amounted to
$61,471, which exceeded the carrying value of the Companys investment in affiliates by $13,511.

reporting as of July31, 2003. These intangible assets were being amortized over the term of
the steel supply contracts, one of which expires in 2012 and the other in 2013, using the
straight-line method. No residual value was assigned to these contracts. The Company recorded

Under the provisions of SOP 90-7 and FASB 109, either pre-confirmation net operating loss
carryforwards or benefits resulting from the reversal of a valuation allowance applicable to
other deferred tax assets are used first to reduce goodwill, then to reduce other intangible
assets, and finally as a credit to additional paid-in capital. During 2006 and 2005, other
intangible assets was reduced by $4,129 and $2,979, respectively, representing the tax benefit
from the utilization of pre-confirmation net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax
assets for which a full valuation allowance has been provided.   
13.
Short-Term Debt   
On July8, 2005, the Company entered into an amended and restated $225,000 revolving credit
agreement, which matures on July8, 2009. This new revolving credit facility amended and
restated the Companys $225,000 revolving credit agreement entered into in August2003, which
was scheduled to mature on August1, 2006. At December31, 2006 and 2005, $110,000 and $17,300
was outstanding under the revolving credit facility, respectively.   
The revolving credit facility requires the Company to maintain minimum borrowing availability of
$50,000 at all times or to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio if borrowing
availability under the revolving credit facility falls below $50,000 at any point in time. If
an event of default occurs under the Companys $250,000 senior secured term loan, such event
will constitute an event of default under the Companys amended and restated revolving credit
agreement. Additionally, if an event of default results in acceleration of the Companys term
loan or revolving credit agreement, such event would also result in the acceleration of
substantially all of the Companys other indebtedness pursuant to cross-default or
cross-acceleration provisions. The Company is restricted from paying any cash dividends under
the terms of the revolving credit agreement.   
On March 16, 2007, the revolving credit agreement was amended to allow the
Company to access collateral in excess of the $225,000 commitment under the
facility. If the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is not met by the Company at 66 Table of Contents   
the end of any quarter and excess collateral, as defined by the agreement, is available,
the Company will be able to access up to $45,000 of such excess collateral over and
above the $225,000 commitment amount and the Company will be required to
maintain at least $50,000 of borrowing availability at all times. Provided that
sufficient collateral will support such borrowings, the Company will be permitted to
borrow up to $220,000 under the facility. The incremental amount of borrowing
availability of up to $45,000 will decrease by $5,000 each quarter commencing with
the fourth quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2008, and will be limited,
thereafter, to up to $25,000 through, but not beyond, November 1, 2008. On this
date and thereafter, the previous requirement that the Company maintain minimum
borrowing availability of $50,000 at all times without access to collateral beyond the
$225,000 million amount of the facility, or to maintain a minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio, will again be applicable.   
Borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is based on eligible accounts
receivable and inventory amounts, as defined by the revolving credit facility. Borrowing
availability is reduced by amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and by
outstanding letters of credit. Interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is
payable monthly and is calculated based on LIBOR or the prime rate using spreads based on
borrowing availability, as defined by the revolving credit facility. The average rate of
interest on amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility during 2006, 2005 and 2004
approximated 79%, 63% and 49%, respectively. Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit
facility are collateralized by a first lien on accounts receivable and inventory and a third
lien on other tangible and intangible assets and investments in affiliates.   
Due to certain mandatory lockbox requirements and other provisions under the revolving credit
agreement, amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility have been classified as a
short-term obligation in accordance with the provisions of EITF 95-22.

$250,000 senior secured term loan   
On August1, 2003, WPSC entered into a $250,000 senior secured term loan agreement. The term
loan agreement matures on August1, 2014. However, if the administrative agent under the loan
is unable or unwilling to re-offer certain tranches of the term loan agreement as of November1,
2008, the maturity date for
each tranche of the term loan agreement will occur on November1, 2008. The term loan agreement
is 67 Table of Contents collateralized by a first lien on tangible and intangible assets and investments in
affiliates and a second lien on accounts receivable and inventory. The term loan agreement is payable in quarterly installments of $6,250. Additional prepayments
are due under the term loan agreement on a quarterly basis equal to 50% of excess cash flow, as
defined by the term loan agreement. Interest on borrowings under the term loan agreement is
payable monthly and is calculated based on LIBOR or the prime rate using spreads defined by the
term loan agreement. The average rate of interest on amounts outstanding under the term loan
agreement during 2006, 2005 and 2004 approximated 63%, 45% and 35%, respectively. The term loan agreement is subject to various financial covenants, including fixed charge,
leverage and interest coverage ratios. On March10, 2006, the Company reached agreement with
both the lenders under the term loan agreement and the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board the
Loan Board, the Federal loan guarantor, to waive compliance with the leverage, interest
coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios under the term loan agreement through the quarter
ending June30, 2007. As a result, through March16, 2007, the term loan
amendment required the Company to maintain minimum borrowing availability of at least $50,000
under its revolving credit facility at all times or to comply with a minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio if borrowing availability under the revolving credit
facility fell below $50,000. Effective March 16, 2007, the term loan agreement was amended to waive compliance with
the requirement to maintain minimum borrowing availability of $50,000 at all times
or to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The agreement was further
amended to eliminate the leverage and interest coverage ratios for the duration of the
agreement. In place of these covenants, a standalone fixed charge coverage ratio will
take effect for the second quarter of 2008 and thereafter. To effect the amendment,
the Company agreed to use the proceeds from the issuance of $50,000 of convertible
debt to make a principal prepayment of $37,500 under its term loan agreement,
representing satisfaction of the next six quarterly principal payments due under the
term loan agreement and to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate
purposes. The Company also agreed to amend the existing $12,500 standby letter of
credit, previously posted in favor of the term loan lenders, to $11,000 to cover interest
payment obligations to April 1, 2007. The letter of credit will decline as such
interest payments are made. The term loan lenders and Loan Board also agreed to
waive the excess cash flow mandatory repayment provisions of the agreement. The
amendment also provides authorization for us to merge with Esmark. As part of the
amendment, we also agreed, subject to consummation of the merger with Esmark, to
repay or refinance the term loan in full on the later of April 1, 2008 or the date of
such consummation and to release the Loan Board of any further obligation under the
Federal guarantee as well as the West Virginia Housing Development Fund, the State
guarantor, of any further obligation under the state guarantee. In the event that the
merger with Esmark is not consummated, we agreed to change the final maturity date of the loan
from August 1, 2014 to August 1, 2010. 40,000 SeriesA secured notes On August1, 2003, the Company issued SeriesA secured notes in the aggregate amount of $40,000.

In general, all coke produced by the joint venture will be sold to each party at the cost
incurred by the joint venture to produce coke, excluding demolition costs, plus 5%. Pursuant to
coke supply agreements between the parties and the joint venture, the Company acquired over 60%
of all of the coke produced by the joint venture from inception through December31, 2006.

Pension and Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits   
All of the Companys defined benefit pension plans in effect in 1998 were merged into plans
maintained by a subsidiary of WHX Corporation the Companys former parent during 1998. As a
result of the Companys reorganization, effective August1, 2003, all of these defined benefit
pension plans were frozen. The Company has no remaining obligation under any of these plans.   
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans   
Effective August1, 2003, the Company adopted a supplemental defined benefit pension plan for
all salaried employees employed as of January31, 1998, which provides a guaranteed minimum
benefit based on years of service and compensation. The total benefit payable under this plan
is offset by the employees account balance in a salaried defined contribution pension plan, the
employees accrued benefit payable by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation related to a
defined pension benefit plan terminated in 1985 and the employees accrued benefit payable as of
July31, 2003 under a plan sponsored by WHX Corporation.   
Upon emergence from bankruptcy and pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement with the USW,
the Company agreed to provide enhanced benefits to up to 650 union employees who were retirement
eligible, and who elected to retire under a job buyout program offered by the Company. Under
terms of the plan, individuals electing to retire under the job buyout program were entitled to
receive a benefit of $40 payable in equal installments until the individual reached the age of
62 or for a period of two years, whichever was longer. Benefits under the job buyout program
are paid by the Company through its defined benefit pension plan. As a result, it was
determined that obligations under this plan should be included in and disclosed as a part of the
defined benefit pension plan as of December31, 2005. Previously, the Company reported all
obligations owing under this plan in the balance sheet as employee benefits payable.   
The Company maintains health care and life insurance benefit plans for retired salaried
employees and for hourly employees retiring after October1, 2003. Hourly employees who retired
prior to October1, 2003 are provided similar benefits under a Voluntary Employee Benefits
Association VEBAtrust See Note 18. In general, these plans pay a percentage of medical
costs, reduced by deductibles and other coverages. The Company has an agreement with the USW to
limit or cap the per capita cost of benefits to be paid for periods subsequent to February1,
2009 at the per capita cost incurred during the twelve-month period ending
January1, 2009.   
The Companys health care and life insurance benefit plans for retired employees provides
prescription drug benefits. At December31, 2004, a determination as to whether the Companys
prescription drug benefit plan was actuarially equivalent of benefits provided under Medicare
part D could not be made, pending issuance of final guidance on making such a determination.
During 2005, based on final guidance, a determination was made that the Companys prescription
drug benefit plan was actuarially equivalent to the prescription drug benefits under Medicare
PartD. As a result, the Company will qualify for a Federal subsidy relative to its
prescription drug benefit plan. The effect of this subsidy was to reduce the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by $12,778 at December31, 2005 and to reduce the net periodic
benefit cost for postretirement benefits by $1,910 for the year ended December31, 2005.   
The Company uses a December31 measurement date for all benefit plans. 71 Table of Contents Benefit obligation and funded status The benefit obligation, change in plan assets, funded status and the amounts recognized in the

As a result of the initial application of FASB No158 as of December31, 2006, the net
amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets decreased by $396. The decrease in the
deferred tax asset was offset by a corresponding change in the valuation allowance. As a
result, the amount credited to accumulated other comprehensive income was computed without tax
effect. The accumulated benefit obligation for the Companys defined benefit pension plan was $5,151 and

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on expected future rates of
return on plan assets considering the current and future investment portfolio. At December31,
2006, a discount rate of 59% was assumed to determine the pension and postretirement benefit
obligations. This rate was based on the yield curve for high-quality corporate bonds as matched
to the projected plan payments which will be made over an extended period of time. Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows

Plan Assets The Companys pension plan investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plan will be
invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plan as those obligations come due.

scheduled payment obligations under the Companys job buyout program. The remaining portion of
plan assets are invested in short-term debt securities with maturities scheduled to meet
longer-term obligations of the plan. 74 Table of Contents Plan assets allocations, by major category, at December31, 2006 and 2005 and targeted plan

Net deferred tax asset liability
$
$
At December31, 2006, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for Federal income
tax purposes of approximately $344,135. Of this amount, approximately $3,290 relates to excess
tax benefits associated with stock based compensation, which, when realized, will be recorded as
additional paid-in capital. During 2006, the Company underwent an ownership change pursuant
to Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, the Companys ability to utilize net
operating loss carryforwards to reduce future income taxes payable will be subject to statutory
limitations on an annual basis, estimated to approximate $8,000 to $10,000 per year. This
annual limitation will be increased to the extent that built-in gains inherent in the value of
the Companys assets are realized during the five-year period from the date of the ownership
change. The Company estimates that approximately $45,200 of future tax benefits associated with
net operating losses will be foregone as a 77 Table of Contents   
result of the ownership change annual limitations if not otherwise utilized to
offset built-in gains during the five-year period following the date of the ownership change.   
Due to uncertainties surrounding future realization of the net operating loss carryforward and
other tax benefits, a full valuation allowance has been provided by the Company against the net
deferred tax asset. To the extent that tax benefits are realized from the release of the
valuation allowance applicable to pre-confirmation tax benefits, the recognition of the tax
benefit is first used to reduce goodwill, then to reduce other intangible assets and finally to
increase additional paid-in capital. At December31, 2006, the portion of the valuation
allowance applicable to pre-confirmation tax benefits approximated $43,588, all of which, when
released, will increase additional paid-in capital.   
The statute of limitations has expired for years through 2002. Federal income tax returns have
been examined through 1997. Additionally, while the Company is no longer affiliated with WHX,
the Companys former parent, the Companys tax attributes could be impacted by an audit of WHX
for those years in which the Company was a subsidiary of WHX.

Commitments and Contingencies   
Environmental Matters   
Prior to confirmation of the Companys plan of reorganization effective August1, 2003, the
Company settled all pre-petition environmental claims made by state Ohio, West Virginia,
Pennsylvania and Federal U.S. Environmental Protection Agency USEPA environmental
regulatory agencies. Consequently, the Company believes that it has settled and/or discharged
environmental liability for any known Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act CERCLA or Superfund sites, pre-petition stipulated penalties related to active
consent decrees, or other pre-petition regulatory enforcement actions.   
During the second quarter of 2006, the Company received notification from the USEPA advising
that the USEPA and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Ohio EPA will conduct an inquiry
aimed at resolving various environmental matters, all of which are identified, discussed and
reserved for as noted below. These inquiries commenced during the third quarter of 2006 and
continued during the fourth quarter of 2006.   
The Company estimates that demands for stipulated penalties and fines for post-petition events
and activities through December31, 2006 could total up to $3,260, which has been fully reserved
by the Company. These claims arise from instances in which the Company exceeded post-petition
consent decree terms, including: a
$2,442 related to a January30, 1996 USEPA consent decree for the Companys coke oven gas
desulphurization facility; b $589 related to a July1991 USEPA consent decree for water
discharges into the Ohio River; c $105 related to a September20, 1999 Ohio EPA consent decree
for the Companys coke oven gas desulphurization facility; and d $124 related to a 1992 USEPA
consent order for other water discharges issues. The Company may have defenses to certain of
these exceedances.   
In September2000, the Company entered into a consent order with the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection wherein the Company agreed to remove contaminated sediments from the
bed of the Ohio River. The Company estimates the cost of removal of the remaining contaminated
sediments to be $1,558 79 Table of Contents at December31, 2006, which has been fully reserved by the Company. The
Company currently expects this work to be substantially complete by the end of 2007. The Company is under a final administrative order issued by the USEPA in June1998 to conduct a
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Facility Investigation to determine the nature and extent
of soil and groundwater contamination at its coke plant in Follansbee, West Virginia. The USEPA
approved the Companys investigation work plan, and field activities were completed in 2004. The
Company submitted the results of this investigation to the USEPA in the third quarter of 2005.
It is expected that some remediation measures will be necessary and could commence within the
next three to five years. Based on an initial estimate of the range of the possible cost to
remediate, the Company has reserved $4,310 for such remediation measures. The Company has also accrued $400 related to a 1989 consent order issued by the USEPA for
surface impoundment issues at a coke plant facility owned by MSC. In July2005, an additional environmental liability was identified regarding the potential for
migration of subsurface oil from historical operations into waters in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. A remediation plan was developed in 2005 and a revised remediation plan was
submitted to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the third quarter of 2006. An estimated
expenditure of $983 is expected to be made during 2007 to address this environmental liability,
which has been fully reserved by the Company. Total accrued environmental liabilities amounted to $10,511 and $9,872 at December31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. These accruals were based on all information available to the Company. As
new information becomes available, whether from third parties or otherwise, and as environmental
regulations change, the liabilities are reviewed and adjusted accordingly. Unless stated above,
the time frame over which these liabilities will be satisfied is presently unknown. Further,
the Company considers it reasonably possible that it could ultimately incur additional
liabilities relative to the above exposures of up to $5,000. Capital expenditures for environmental projects totaled $6,130 during 2006. Commitments In June2005, the Company entered into a contract to purchase up to 20,000 tons of metallurgical
coal each month for the period from August2006 through May2007 at a price of $9450 per ton.
The contract requires the Company to pay an average buy-out cost of $750 per ton for each ton
of coal that is not taken under the contract. Payments for delivery of coal under this contract
totaled $6,668 during 2006. In addition, the Company made a prepayment of $5,100 under the
terms of the contract, which will be applied ratably to reduce the cash cost of each ton of coal
delivered under the contract. As of December31, 2006, the unamortized prepayment amounted to
$3,065. This amount is subject to forfeiture if coal is not taken under the contract. The Company entered into a 15-year take-or-pay contract in 1999, which was amended in 2003 and
requires the Company to purchase oxygen, nitrogen and argon each month with a minimum monthly
charge of approximately $600, subject to escalation clauses. Payments for deliveries under this contract
totaled $12,150, $10,621 and $14,200 during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company entered into a 20-year contract in 1999, which was amended in 2003 and requires the
Company to purchase steam and electricity each month or pay a minimum monthly charge of
approximately $500, subject to increases for inflation, and a variable charge calculated at a
minimum of $375 times the number of tons of iron produced each month, with an agreed-to minimum
of 3,250 tons per day, regardless of whether any tons are produced. Payments for delivery of
steam and electricity under this contract totaled $12,867, $9,652 and $9,150 during 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. At December31, 2006, a maximum termination payment of approximately
$27,750 would have been required to terminate the contract. Under terms of MSCs joint venture agreement, the Company and SNA Carbon have agreed to
refurbish a coke plant facility owned by MSC. The Company is committed to make capital
contributions of $25,000 to MSC in 2007. 80 Table of Contents   
Guarantees   
In March2006, the Company entered into an operating lease for certain mobile equipment, which
contains a residual lease guarantee approximating $581. This residual lease guarantee has been
reflected in the financial statements as an obligation and is included in other current
liabilities.   
Other   
The Company is the subject of, or party to, a number of other pending or threatened legal
actions involving a variety of matters. However, based on information currently available,
management believes that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the business, results of operations or the financial position of the Company.   
24.
Subsequent Events   
On March8, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors voted to approve a merger agreement between
the Company and Esmark Incorporated and voted to recommend that the stockholders adopt such
merger agreement.   
At December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants
under its revolving credit agreement and its term loan agreement. However, no
assurance could be provided that the Company would be in compliance with such
financial covenants for quarters ending after December 31, 2006. In order to
generate liquidity and to provide reasonable assurance that the Company will
continue to be in compliance with its financial covenants for quarters ending after
December 31, 2006, the Company effected the transactions described below
subsequent to December 31, 2006.   
On March15, 2007, certain institutional investors who are stockholders of the Company and Esmark,
and James P. Bouchard, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Craig T. Bouchard,
the Companys Vice Chairman and President agreed to purchase convertible notes from the Company,
and on March16, 2007, the Company received $50,000 and issued convertible subordinated
promissory notes. The debt will be convertible into the Companys common stock upon consummation
of a merger between the Company and Esmark at a price of $20 per share and the holders of the
convertible notes will be permitted to participate in the Esmark merger as stockholders of the
Company, or if not consummated, at the election of the investors, the notes may be converted at an
alternative conversion price which will not be more than $20 per share or less than $15 per share
or shall be payable in cash on November15, 2008, subject to limitations relative to the Companys
term loan agreement and revolving credit facility. Interest shall be payable in cash at a per
annum rate of 6% payable quarterly in arrears. In the event that the merger between the Company
and Esmark is not consummated by January1, 2008, the per annum interest rate shall increase to 9%
per annum retroactively to the issuance date. The proceeds from such convertible debt will be used
to pay down indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.   
On March 16, 2007, the revolving credit agreement was amended to allow the
Company to access collateral in excess of the $225,000 commitment under the
facility. If the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is not met by the Company at
the end of any quarter and excess collateral, as defined by the agreement, is
available, the Company will be able to access up to $45,000 of such excess collateral
over and above the $225,000 commitment amount and the Company will be required
to maintain at least $50,000 of borrowing availability at all times. Provided that
sufficient collateral will support such borrowings, the Company will be permitted to
borrow up to $220,000 under the facility. The incremental amount of borrowing
availability of up to $45,000 will decrease by $5,000 each quarter commencing with
the fourth quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2008, and will be limited,
thereafter, to up to $25,000 through, but not beyond, November 1, 2008. On this
date and thereafter, the previous requirement that the Company maintain minimum
borrowing availability of $50,000 at all times without access to collateral beyond the
$225,000 million amount of the facility, or to maintain a minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio, will again be applicable.   
Effective March 16, 2007, the term loan agreement was amended to waive compliance with
the requirement to maintain minimum borrowing availability of $50,000 at all times
or to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The agreement was further
amended to eliminate the leverage and interest coverage ratios for the duration of the
agreement. In place of these covenants, a standalone fixed charge coverage ratio will
take effect for the second quarter of 2008 and thereafter. To effect the amendment,
the Company agreed to use the proceeds from the issuance of $50,000 of convertible
debt to make a principal prepayment of $37,500 under its term loan agreement,
representing satisfaction of the next six quarterly principal payments due under the
term loan agreement and to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate
purposes. The Company also agreed to amend the existing $12,500 standby letter of
credit, previously posted in favor of the term loan lenders, to $11,000 to cover interest
payment obligations to April 1, 2007. The letter of credit will decline as such
interest payments are made. The term loan lenders and Loan Board also agreed to
waive the excess cash flow mandatory repayment provisions of the agreement. The
amendment also provides authorization for us to merge with Esmark. As part of the
amendment, we also agreed, subject to consummation of the merger with Esmark, to
repay or refinance the term loan in full on the later of April 1, 2008 or the date of
such consummation and to release the Loan Board of any further obligation under the
Federal guarantee as well as the West Virginia Housing Development Fund, the State
guarantor, of any further obligation under the state guarantee. In the event that the
merger with Esmark is not consummated, we agreed to change the final maturity date of the loan
from August 1, 2014 to August 1, 2010. 81 Table of Contents   25.
