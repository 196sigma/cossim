NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1998 AND 1999 1.   ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS
Aris Corporation Aris or the Company provides a range of
integrated information technology solutions including database management,
enterprise resource planning, custom applications development and packaged
applications implementation, and training to clients worldwide, with offices in
Bellevue, Seattle and Renton, Washington; Beaverton, Oregon; Denver, Colorado;
Dallas and Plano, Texas; Fairfax, Virginia; Tampa and West Palm Beach, Florida;
Columbia, South Carolina; Livingston, New Jersey; Oxford, Birmingham, Reading
and London, England; and Heidelberg, Germany. Aris also develops niche software
programs which it has licensed worldwide.
CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aris and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to
conform to current year presentations. Such reclassifications had no effect on
previously reported net income or loss, shareholders' equity or cash flows.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments with an
original maturity of three months or less.                    -36-
37
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company places its temporary cash investments with major financial
institutions. As of December 31, 1999, all of the Company temporary cash
investments were placed with one institution.
The Company customers are from diverse industries and geographic
locations. For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, and 1999, no single
customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company net revenues. At December
31, 1998 and 1999, there were no significant accounts receivable from a single
customer. The Company does not require collateral to support credit sales.
Allowances are maintained for potential credit losses and sales returns.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES
Aris' investment in marketable securities at December 31, 1998 are
classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. Fair value is
based upon quoted market prices. The increase or decrease in market value from
period to period relating to available-for-sale marketable securities, net of
deferred income taxes, is included as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. Cost of securities sold is determined using the specific
identification method. The Company had no investment securities as of December
31, 1999.
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of course materials and are recorded at the lower of
cost or market, as determined by the first-in, first-out method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions, improvements and
major replacements are capitalized. For financial reporting purposes,
depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of depreciable assets. Estimated useful lives of computers,
equipment and software range from three to eight years and lives of building and
improvements range 15 to 39 years.
The Company has adopted Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,
which establishes guidelines for the accounting for the costs of all computer
software developed or obtained for internal use. This pronouncement has not had
a material impact on the Company financial statements.                    -37-
38
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets include the cost of business acquisitions allocated to
capitalized software, non-compete agreements, customer lists, trained work
force, leasehold valuations, tradename, and goodwill which are amortized over
approximately three years for capitalized software, approximately two years for
non-compete agreements, three years for customer lists and trained work force,
six years for leasehold valuation, one year for tradename and five, seven or
fifteen years for goodwill. Amortization of capitalized software is computed as
described below while the straight-line method is used for other intangible
assets. The carrying value of intangible assets is assessed for any permanent
impairment by evaluating the operating performance and future undiscounted cash
flows of the underlying assets. Adjustments are made if the sum of the expected
future net cash flows is less than book value in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of as issued by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB. SFAS No. 121 requires that
long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be
recoverable.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Software development costs incurred in conjunction with product
development are charged to product development expense until technological
feasibility is established. Thereafter, through general release of product, all
software product development costs are capitalized and reported at the lower of
unamortized cost or net realizable value of each product. The establishment of
technological feasibility and the on-going assessment of the recoverability of
costs require considerable judgment by Aris with respect to certain external
factors, including, but not limited to, anticipated future gross product
revenues, estimated economic life and changes in the software and hardware
technology. After consideration of the above factors, Aris amortizes capitalized
software costs at the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio of
current revenues for a product to the total of current and anticipated future
revenues, or b the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic
life of the product.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Expenditures relating to the development of new products and processes,
including significant improvements and refinements to existing products, are
expensed as incurred. The costs of business acquisitions allocated to in-process
research and development are expensed immediately. The Company expensed $649,000
of in-process research and development in 1997.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
TIME AND MATERIAL CONSULTING CONTRACTS
Aris recognizes revenue as services are rendered.                    -38-
39
FIXED-PRICE CONSULTING CONTRACTS
Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method, measured by the cost incurred to date and cost
to complete compared to estimated total costs for the contract. This method is
used because management considers expended costs together with estimates of
remaining costs to be the best available measure of contract performance.
Contract costs include all direct labor, material and other costs related to
contract performance. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to
expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts
are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job
performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising
from contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements may result in
revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the
revisions are determined.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Tuition revenue is recognized ratably throughout the period that classes
are held.
SOFTWARE
Aris accounts for software revenues in accordance with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants' SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition. Revenues earned under software license agreements with end users
are generally recognized when the software has been shipped, collectibility is
probable, and there are no significant obligations remaining.
Aris initially defers revenue on the sale of extended software service
contracts which is then recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the
contract period.
INCOME TAXES
Provision for income taxes has been recorded in accordance with SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the liability method of SFAS No. 109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and of tax loss and
credit carryforwards, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that
will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses
amounted to $600,000, $495,000 and $121,000 in 1997, 1998 and 1999,
respectively.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS
The financial statements of Aris' foreign subsidiaries have been
translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency
Translation. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 52, all assets and liabilities in
the balance sheet of the foreign                    -39-
40
subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the U.K. Pound Sterling, are
translated at year-end exchange rates, profit and loss accounts are translated
at average exchange rates prevailing during the period and translation gains and
losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and other current
assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheets approximates fair
value based on the short-term nature of these instruments. Investments in
marketable securities are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Stock-based compensation is accounted for by following FASB Statement
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under the provisions of this
Statement, employee stock-based compensation expense is measured using either
the intrinsic-value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
APB No. 25 or the fair value method described in FASB Statement No. 123.
Companies choosing the intrinsic-value method are required to disclose the pro
forma impact of the fair value method on net income. Aris has elected to
continue accounting for its employee stock-based compensation under the
provisions of APB No. 25.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated as income available to Common
Shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the periods. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted-average
number of shares of Common Stock and dilutive securities outstanding during the
periods, including options and warrants computed using the treasury stock
method. All earnings per share amounts from prior periods have been restated to
reflect the adoption of SFAS No128.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
In addition to net income, comprehensive income includes charges or
credits to equity that are not the result of transactions with shareholders. The
composition of accumulated other comprehensive income is reflected in the
statement of changes in shareholders' equity.
The unrealized gains on securities is shown net of tax of $35,000, $0
and $0 at December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards
for the way that                    -40-
41
public business enterprises report information about operating segments in
annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected
information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to
shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about
products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Company has
adopted SFAS No. 131 and has provided the disclosures needed to conform with its
requirements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement requires that all derivative
instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of
a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. In July 1999,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No.
137 deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 until fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000. The Company does not use derivative instruments, therefore
the adoption of this statement will not have any effect on the Company results
of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC
released Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements. This pronouncement summarizes certain of the SEC staff
views on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue
recognition. We are required to adopt SAB No. 101 for our fiscal year ending
December 31, 2001. We are currently reviewing the requirements of SAB No. 101,
but do not expect such adoption to have an impact on our results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.
2.   POOLINGS OF INTERESTS WITH BAREFOOT COMPUTER TRAINING LIMITED AND
INTIME SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.
On February 28, 1998, Aris completed a merger with Barefoot Computer
Training Limited Barefoot, a company that provides information technology
training services in London, England. Under the terms of the merger, Aris issued
278,611 shares of Common Stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of
Barefoot Common Stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of
interests and, accordingly, all periods prior to February 28, 1998 included in
these consolidated financial statements have been restated to give effect to the
merger.
Barefoot had a November 30 year end and, accordingly, Barefoot
statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 1997 has been combined
with Aris' statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1997. In
order to conform Barefoot year end to Aris' year end, Barefoot financial
statements for the month of December 1997 are not                    -41-
42
included in the statements of operations or cash flows for 1997. Barefoot net
loss for December 1997 decreased retained earnings as of January 1, 1998.
On June 30, 1998, the Company completed a merger with InTime Systems
International, Inc. InTime, a Delaware corporation having its principal
offices in West Palm Beach, Florida. InTime, now a division of the Company,
provides information technology and human resource management systems consulting
services focusing primarily on Oracle and PeopleSoft technologies. The
acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests, in which the Company
issued 786,710 shares of Common Stock in exchange for all of the outstanding
shares of InTime Common Stock and warrants to purchase 718,997 shares of Common
Stock in exchange for all of the outstanding warrants to purchase shares of
InTime Common Stock. Accordingly, all periods prior to June 30, 1998 included in
the consolidated financial statements furnished herein have been restated to
give effect to the merger.

tax assets of InTime in the total amount of $420,000 which could be offset
with future reversals of deferred tax liabilities of Aris upon the merger
of InTime into Aris effective June 30, 1998.
3.   RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXPENSE
In December 1998, the Company restructured its training operations to
gain efficiency and profitability. As a result of the restructuring, the Company
incurred expenses aggregating $22 million, including $873,000 for employee
severance, $559,000 for equipment and asset abandonment, $593,000 for
anticipated lease disposition costs and $160,000 associated with other aspects
of the restructuring. At December 15, 1998, $13 million of the amount accrued
was paid. The Company completed the restructuring and utilized all accrued costs
by June 30, 1999.
Additionally, in 1998, the Company settled a litigation claim and
expensed $759,000. Management believes that a portion of the litigation
settlement cost may be recovered from insurance proceeds.
In August 1999, in a continuing effort to improve the profitability of
its training                    -42-
43
division, Aris closed three unprofitable training centers located in New York,
Minneapolis and Chicago. The estimated costs associated with the closing of
these centers was approximately $66 million. A summary of the related costs and
accrual activity is as follows in thousands                                 REDUCTION IN

The remaining balance accrued for contract and lease terminations at
December 31, 1999, represents estimated lease payments through July 2000, net of
sublease income, and estimated brokers commissions and improvements deemed
necessary to sublet the spaces. This remaining balance is expected to be
utilized during 2000.
In January 2000, Aris negotiated a lease termination for the Minneapolis
location at a cost of $250,000. Additionally, subsequent to year end, the
Company sublet the Chicago location through the remaining life of the lease.
4.   ACQUISITIONS
Aris has embarked upon an acquisition program that included the
acquisition of four companies during 1997, two companies during 1998 and one
company in 1999, which have been accounted for by the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on management estimates, arms-length
negotiations with the sellers and in some cases, independent appraisals. The
Common Stock issued as consideration in these acquisitions has been recorded at
its estimated fair value at the date the acquisition was completed. The results
of operations of the acquired companies have been included in consolidated

normal course of business. Based on the advice of legal counsel, management does
not anticipate that these matters will have a material effect on Aris'
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
11.   SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
In June 1997, Aris completed an initial public offering of 23 million
shares of Common Stock with net proceeds of approximately $312 million.
The Company initiated on January 1, 1998, the 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the ESPP. Under the ESPP, employees may elect to set aside up
to 10% of their gross                    -49-
50
compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 per year, to purchase shares of Common
Stock at a 15% discount to market price. Executive officers other than the
Chief Executive Officer may participate in the ESPP on the same terms as
eligible, non-executive employees.
12.   EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated as income available to common
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share is based on the
weighted average number of shares of Common Stock and potential common shares
outstanding during the periods, including options and warrants computed using
the treasury stock method.
The difference between the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share and the weighted-average
number of common and potential common shares outstanding used to calculate
diluted earnings per share is the incremental shares attributed to outstanding
options and warrants to purchase Common Stock computed using the treasury stock
method. In thousands                        YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Common equivalent shares outstanding..   10,532   11,900   11,605
Options to purchase certain shares of Common Stock were outstanding in
1997, 1998 and 1999, but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the options' exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the common shares.
Dilutive securities include options and warrants on an as if converted
basis. Potentially dilutive securities totaling 284,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999, were excluded from diluted loss per share because of their
anti-dilutive effect.
13.   STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
Prior to January 1995, Aris from time to time granted non-qualified
stock options to key employees. These grants were not part of any formal plan.
In January 1995, Aris adopted the Aris Corporation 1995 Stock Option
Plan the 1995 Plan which provides for the granting of qualified or
non-qualified stock options to employees, directors, officers and certain
non-employees of Aris as determined by the Plan Administrator. Aris authorized
1,600,000 shares of its Common Stock for issuance under the 1995 Plan. The date
of grant, option price, vesting period and other terms specific to options
granted under the 1995 Plan are determined by the Plan Administrator. The option
price for                    -50-
51
stock options granted is based on the fair market value of Aris' stock on the
date of grant. Options granted under the 1995 Plan expire seven years from the
date of grant and vest over periods of up to four years. Aris ended grants under
the 1995 Plan in March 1997.
In March 1997, Aris adopted the Aris Corporation 1997 Stock Option Plan
the 1997 Plan which provides for the granting of qualified or non-qualified
stock options to employees, directors, officers and non-employee directors of
Aris as determined by the Plan Administrator. Aris authorized 2,000,000 shares
of its Common Stock for issuance under the 1997 Plan, subject to certain
adjustments, reduced by the number of shares that have been granted and have not
subsequently become available for grant under the 1995 Plan. The 1997 Plan
provides for automatic, non-discretionary grants of 5,000 non-qualified stock
options to non-employee directors for each year of service. For all other grants
under the 1997 Plan, the date of grant, option price, vesting period and other
terms specific to options granted under the 1997 Plan are to be determined by
the Plan Administrator. The option price for stock options granted is based on
the fair market value of Aris' stock on the date of grant. Options granted under
the 1997 Plan expire ten years from the date of grant and vest over periods of
up to four years. On April 28, 1998, the shareholders of the Company approved an
increase in the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under
the 1997 Plan to 2,000,000 shares and subsequently, on May 24, 1999, the
shareholders of the Company approved a further increase to 2,225,000 shares.
In connection with the acquisition of Enterprise in 1997 as discussed
in Note 4, Aris issued warrants to purchase 20,844 shares of Common Stock with
an exercise price of $23988 and a fair value of $895. Additionally, during
1997 Aris issued warrants to purchase 4,000 shares of Common Stock with an
exercise price of $1000 to certain Aris consultants.
In connection with the acquisition of InTime as discussed in Note 2,
Aris issued warrants to purchase 718,997 shares of Common Stock as consideration
to the former holders of warrants of InTime. The warrants commenced trading on
the Nasdaq National Market on July 16, 1998. Each warrant entitled the holder to
purchase one share of the Company Common Stock at an exercise price of $2298
with an expiration date of February 15, 2000.
On December 15, 1998, the Company completed its voluntary stock option
exchange with existing employees holding options granted under the Company
1997 Stock Option Plan. Senior management was precluded from participating in
that exchange. Eligible employees electing to participate in the exchange
surrendered their existing options and received new options to purchase 20%
fewer shares of the Company Common Stock at an exercise price of $975 per
share, upon a modified vesting schedule.
In connection with the acquisition of fine.com as discussed in Note 4,
Aris issued 110,883 warrants to purchase the number of shares of Aris Common
Stock and cash received for each outstanding share of fine.com Common Stock
exchanged in the merger. The warrants expire on August 11, 2002.

to 1995, the 1995 Plan, and the 1997 Plan is presented below                    -51-

Aris applies APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related Interpretations in accounting for stock options issued to employees. Had
compensation cost for the options been determined based upon the fair value at
the grant date consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123,

were no employer contributions to the plan for 1997. In 1998, the Company
instituted a 401k matching contribution program whereby the Company matched
each employees' contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to $800 per
participating employee. During 1998 and 1999, the Company contributed $256,000
and $248,000, respectively, to the 401k plan.

The Company reportable segments have been determined based on the
nature of its operations, products offered to customers and information used by
the chief operating decision maker, as defined by SFAS No. 131. Aris is engaged
in three distinct businesses consisting of database and internet consulting
services, information technology training and software sales. The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies. Segment operating results are measured based on
income loss before income taxes. Total revenue by segment represents sales to
unaffiliated customers. Inter-segment sales are not material. Assets are those
used in the operations of each industry segment. Corporate assets are not
allocated to segments and primarily consist of cash, investments, certain
prepaid expenses and certain property and equipment.
