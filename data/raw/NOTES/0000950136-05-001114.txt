36 REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To Board of
Directors and Stockholders
Strayer Education, Inc.
We
have completed an integrated audit of Strayer Education, Inc.
2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and
2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule
In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Strayer Education, Inc.
and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in
the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial
statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
Internal control over financial
reporting
Also, in our opinion, management
assessment, included in Management Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based
on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by COSO. The Company management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal
control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit
of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
37 recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iii provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

EDUCATION, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
1.Nature of
Operations
Strayer Education, Inc. the
Company, a Maryland corporation, conducts
its operations through its subsidiaries, Strayer University, Inc. the
University and Education Loan Processing,
Inc. ELP. The University is an accredited
institution of higher education that provides undergraduate and
graduate degrees in various fields of study through, as of December 31,
2004, 30 campuses in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, D.C.,
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia, and
worldwide via the Internet through Strayer University Online. The
Company has also been approved to offer its programs in Florida and
plans to open two campuses in Tampa, Florida as well as three more
campuses elsewhere in its existing states in 2005. With the
Company focus on the customer, regardless of whether he or she
chooses to take classes at a physical campus or online, we have only
one reporting segment.
In May 2001, the Company underwent a $150
million recapitalization and change of control transaction in which it
issued 5,769,231 shares of its Series A Convertible Mandatorily
Redeemable Preferred Stock the Series A Convertible
Redeemable Preferred Stock of the Company to an investor
group consisting of New Mountain Partners, L.P. and MidOcean Capital
Investors, L.P. formerly DB Capital Partners, Inc. collectively, the
Original Investors. The Series A
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock had an effective dividend yield
of 543% and each share of Series A Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock was convertible into one share common stock, subject to
adjustment under certain circumstances. The Company used the $150
million, together with approximately $364 million of its cash and
marketable securities, to repurchase 7,175,000 shares of outstanding
common stock of the Company in a tender offer at $2500 per share open
to all shareholders; as the Company shares had traded above
$2500 per share, only the Company then CEO and majority
stockholder tendered shares. In November 2002, 23 million shares of
the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock were converted into
common stock on a one for one basis and, pursuant to the Original
Investors' registration rights agreement with the Company, were
sold in a secondary offering of common stock at $5200 per share. The
Company did not receive any proceeds from the offering. In March 2004,
31 million outstanding and accrued shares of the Series A Convertible
Redeemable Preferred Stock were converted into shares of common stock
on a one for one basis and sold in a secondary public offering. The
Company received no proceeds from such offering other than $42 million
associated with certain management option exercises in connection with
the secondary offering. In June 2004, the remaining 875,120 outstanding
and accrued shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock
were called for redemption by the Company and in lieu of being redeemed
for cash, were converted by the holders into 875,120 common shares in
accordance with the terms of the Series A shares. As a result, the
Company does not have any preferred shares outstanding.
2.Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, the University, ELP, and
Professional Education, Inc. which is currently an inactive
subsidiary. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Cash and
Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash
invested in bank overnight deposits and money market mutual funds. The
Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with high
quality credit institutions. The Company considers all highly liquid
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at the
date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
43 STRAYER
EDUCATION, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued
Marketable Securities
The
Company investments in marketable securities consist solely of
publicly traded securities and are recorded at fair value based on the
quoted market prices. The investments are considered
available-for-sale as they are not held for
trading and will not be held to maturity, in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company records the
net unrealized gains and losses for changes in fair value as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders' equity deficit. Realized gains and losses from
the sale of marketable securities are based on the specific
identification method.
Revenues
The Company
educational programs are offered on a quarterly basis. Approximately
96% of the Company revenues during the year ended
December 31, 2004 consisted of tuition revenue. Tuition revenue is
deferred at the time of registration and is recognized in the quarter
of instruction. Tuition revenue is shown net of any refunds,
withdrawals or corporate discounts. Advance registrations for the next
quarter are shown as unearned tuition. Beginning in the first quarter
2004, the Company began recording employee tuition discounts and
scholarships awards as a reduction to revenues. In prior years,
these items totaling $16 million and $22 million for the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively were classified as operating
expenses.
Revenues also include application fees, commencement
fees, placement test fees, withdrawal fees, loan service and
origination fees and other income which are recognized when incurred.
Beginning in the first quarter 2004, the Company began recording
textbook-related income as revenues. In prior years, this income $04
million and $06 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2003, respectively was included in Investment and other income. This
change in classification, as well as the one referenced above, had no
impact on net income and is an immaterial amount.
Student Loans
Receivable
In the fourth quarter 2003, the Company sold its $10
million student loan portfolio to a national student loan marketing
organization. The impact of this transaction was a gain of $06 million
which was recorded as revenue. The Company may continue to originate
student loans which it expects to periodically divest. Loans originated
and held for sale are classified as a current asset. Student loans
receivable, which were not included in the loan portfolio sale in the
fourth quarter of 2003 and which are not held for sale, are classified
as a non-current asset, consistent with industry practice.
Student loans receivable are stated at the amount of unpaid
principal, reduced by an allowance for loan losses. Interest income
from student loans is recorded as revenue and recognized using the
effective interest method. Provisions for estimated losses on student
loans not held for sale are charged to income in amounts sufficient to
maintain the allowance at a level considered adequate to cover the
losses of principal and interest in the existing loan portfolio, based
upon historical trends, economic conditions and other information.
ELP charge-off policy is based on a loan-by-loan review;
however, any loan with payments more than 120 days past due is written
off against the allowance.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments in money
market mutual funds and bank overnight deposits with high credit
quality institutions. Cash and cash equivalent balances are generally
in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The Company has not experienced
any losses on its cash and cash equivalents. The Company has also
invested its excess cash in a diversified, short-term, investment
grade, tax-exempt bond fund that is classified under
Marketable Securities.
Tuition
receivables are not collateralized; however, credit risk is minimized
as a result of the diverse nature of the University student
base, as of December 31, 2004, in Pennsylvania, Maryland, 
44 STRAYER
EDUCATION, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued
Washington, D.C., Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia. The University establishes an
allowance for doubtful tuition accounts based upon historical trends
and other information.
With the sale of its student loan
portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company has significantly
reduced its credit risk in this area. Although the Company may continue
to originate student loans, it intends to divest these loans to
long-term lenders which should keep credit risk to a minimum.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the carrying values of
the Company assets are re-evaluated when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred
based on expected undiscounted future cash flows, then a loss is
recognized using a fair-value based model. Through 2004, no such
impairment loss had occurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is
calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives ranging from 3 to 40 years. Depreciation and amortization
amounted to $3,642,000, $4,367,000 and $5,375,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.
Income
Taxes
The Company provides for deferred income taxes based on
temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year
in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Advertising
Costs
The Company expenses advertising costs in the quarter in
which incurred, except for costs associated with the production of
television commercials which are expensed when the commercial is first
used.
Long-Term Liabilities
In conjunction with the
opening of some new campuses and other facilities, the Company was
reimbursed by the lessors for improvements made to those leased
properties. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Technical Bullletin No. 88-1, these reimbursements were capitalized as
leasehold improvements and a long-term liability established. The
leasehold improvements and the long-term liability are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the corresponding lease terms, which range
from five to ten years.
In accordance with the FASB Technical
Bulletin No. 85-3, Accounting for Operating Leases with
Schedule Rent Increases, the Company records rent expense
on a straight-line basis over the initial term of a lease. The
difference between the rent payment and the straight-line rent expense
is recorded as a long-term liability.
Deferred lease incentives
for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 have been reclassified
on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to conform to the December
31, 2004 presentation. Prior to 2004, deferred lease incentives were
classified as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows and are now classified as an operating activity. This change
in classification had no impact on Net increase decrease in cash and
cash equivalents, and is immaterial to prior periods.

EDUCATION, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Stock-Based Compensation
The
Company uses the intrinsic-value-based method of accounting for its
stock option plan. Under the intrinsic-value-based method, compensation
cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at
grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.
The Company generally grants stock options with an exercise price equal
to or above the market value of the common stock on the date of
grant.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to
estimate fair value as of the date of grant using the following
assumptions 2002

Net Income Per Share
Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the periods. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average common and potentially dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding, determined as follows in

Use of
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
the period reported. The most significant management estimates included
allowances for uncollectible accounts and student loans receivable,
accrued expenses, potential liabilities for the indemnifications
related to the loan portfolio sale, and the provision for income taxes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Student Loans ReceivableHeld for Sale
In the fourth
quarter 2003, the Company sold its student loan portfolio to a national
student loan marketing organization. The Company recorded revenue of
$580,000 for the gain on the sale of the portfolio. The Company also
recorded a liability of $333,000 for the estimated potential payments
under the indemnification provided to the purchaser of the loans see
Note 9. The Company may continue to originate student loans which it
expects to periodically divest. Loans originated and held for sale are
classified as a current asset. The Company had $29,000 of student loans
receivable held for sale at December 31, 2004.

of December 31, 2004, the Company had $17,000 of student loans
receivable which are not held for sale. Primarily due to poor credit
quality and payment history, the Company has fully reserved these
loans.
The interest rate on these student loans is on average
75%. The Company believes the carrying value of the student
loans approximates their fair value. The loans require a minimum
monthly payment based on a percentage of the outstanding monthly
balance, plus interest, while the student is in attendance. Upon the
student graduation or withdrawal, the loans become due in equal
monthly installments based on a fixed payment plan.
