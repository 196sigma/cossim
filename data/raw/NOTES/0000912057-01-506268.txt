Zoran Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Zoran Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 - THE COMPANY Zoran Corporation Zoran or the Company was incorporated in California in
December 1981 and reincorporated in Delaware in November 1986. Zoran develops
and markets integrated circuits and software products for digital video and
audio applications enabled by compression. The Company integrated circuits and
software products are used in a variety of video and audio products addressing
PC and consumer multimedia markets. Current applications incorporating Zoran
products and IP include professional and consumer video editing systems,
filmless digital cameras, standalone and PC-based DVD players, Super VCD
players, digital speakers and audio systems. The Company operates predominantly
in one industry segment.
The Company performs research and development and generates a substantial
portion of its sales from its operations located in the State of Israel. A
significant number of the Company full-time employees are located in Israel,
including a majority of the Company research and development personnel.
Therefore, the Company is directly affected by the political, economic and
military conditions to which that country is subject.
The semiconductor business is highly cyclical and has been subject to
significant downturns at various times that have been characterized by
diminished product demand, production, overcapacity, and accelerated erosion of
average selling prices. As such, the selling price that the Company is able to
command for its products is highly dependent on industry-wide production
capacity and demand. Both of these factors could result in rapid deviations in
product pricing and therefore could adversely effect the Company operating
results.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zoran and all of
its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation. NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Zoran has adopted accounting policies which are generally accepted in the
industry in which it operates. The following is a summary of the Company
significant accounting policies.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates, although
such differences are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial
statements.
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES
ZML, an Israeli subsidiary, treats the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 SFAS
52, gains and losses resulting from translation of accounts designated in
other than the functional currency are reflected in results of operations and to
date have been insignificant.
To date, substantially all of the Company product sales have been denominated
in U.S. dollars and most costs of product sales have been incurred in U.S.
dollars. The Company has not experienced material losses or gains as a result of
currency exchange rate fluctuations and has not engaged in hedging transactions
to reduce its exposure to such fluctuations. The Company may take action in the
future to reduce its foreign exchange risk.                    45                 ZORAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment. A provision
for estimated future returns and potential warranty liability is recorded at the
time revenue is recognized. Development revenue under development contracts is
recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Under the
percentage-of-completion method, revenue recognized is that portion of the total
contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to date to the anticipated
final total costs, based on current estimates of the costs to complete the
project. Amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded
as deferred revenue and are generally recognized within one year from receipt.
Estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the
contracts. Any revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the
revisions are made. Costs associated with development revenues are included
primarily in research and development expenses. Revenue resulting from the
licensing of the Company technology is recognized when significant contractual
obligations have been fulfilled and the customer has indicated acceptance. The
Company does not provide customers with product return or exchange rights in
connection with the sale of software licenses. Periodic service and maintenance
fees provide customers access to technical support and minor enhancements to
licensed releases are recognized ratably over the service or maintenance period.
Royalty revenue is recognized in the period licensed sales are reported to the
Company.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Costs related to the conceptual formation and design of internally developed
software are expensed as research and development as incurred. It is the
Company policy that certain internal software development costs incurred after
technological feasibility has been demonstrated and which meet recoverability
tests are capitalized and amortized over the estimated economic life of the
product. To date, the Company has incurred no significant internal software
development costs which meet the criteria for capitalization.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
For certain of Zoran financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
current liabilities, the carrying values approximate their fair values due to
the relatively short maturity of these items.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or
less are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.
All of Zoran investment portfolio is classified as available-for-sale and,
therefore, is reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of
related tax, if any, included as other comprehensive income, a component of
stockholders' equity. Gains and losses realized upon sales of all such
securities are reported in interest and other income and have not been
significant to date.
At December 31, 2000, the Company investment portfolio consisted primarily
of commercial paper with maturities of less than one year. The portfolio also
consisted of bonds and medium term notes with maturities greater than one
year, which are included in other assets, and the stock acquired as a result
of the MGI transaction. The unrealized gain on this stock available for sale
of $1,109,000 included in comprehensive income represents the unrealized gain
on the stock at December 31, 2000.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its                    46                 ZORAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
cash in banks and cash equivalents primarily in auction rate preferred,
certificates of deposit and commercial paper. The Company, by policy, limits the
amount of credit exposure through diversification and highly-rated securities.
The Company has not experienced any significant losses on its cash equivalents
or short-term investments.
The Company markets integrated circuits and technology to manufacturers and
distributors of electronic equipment primarily in North America, Europe and the
Pacific Rim. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed
necessary, but generally does not require collateral. Management believes that
any risk of loss is significantly reduced due to the diversity of its customers
and geographic sales areas. The Company maintains a provision for potential
credit losses, and write-offs of accounts receivable were insignificant in each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. As of December 31,
2000, three customers accounted for approximately 15%, 10% and 7% of the
accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 1999, three customers accounted
for approximately 33%, 12%, and 9% of the accounts receivable balance.
INVENTORY
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual
cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market. Market is based on estimated net
realizable value.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to five years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
Acquired technology is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over two to
three years. Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with
the acquisitions of PixelCam, Inc., and Nogatech, Inc., are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated periods of benefit, which is
approximately three years.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived
assets based on expected undiscounted cash flows and recognizes impairment
from the carrying value of long-lived assets, if any, based on the fair value
of such assets. To date, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges
against the value of its long-lived assets.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes which
requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected
future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
For the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 the provision
for income taxes reflects the effective tax rate applied to earnings for the
periods. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to
utilization of net operating losses and State of Israel tax benefits on
foreign earnings. The provision includes primarily taxes on income in excess
of net operating loss carryover limitations and foreign withholding taxes.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS
128 Zoran reports Earnings per Share EPS, both basic and diluted, on the
statement of operations. Basic EPS is based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average
common shares outstanding plus any potential common stock, except when their
effect is anti-dilutive. Potential common stock includes stock options and
warrants. See Note 8.                    47                 ZORAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
STOCK COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations. Under
APB No25, compensation expense is recognized based on the difference, if any,
on the date of grant between the fair value of the Company stock and the
amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The compensation expense is
recognized over the periods the employee performs the related services,
generally the vesting period of four years, consistent with the multiple option
method described in FASB Interpretation No. 28 FIN28. The Company provides
additional pro forma disclosures as required under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. See Note7.
SEGMENT REPORTING
In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131
SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. The management approach established by SFAS 131 designates the
internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions
and assessing performance as the source of the Company reportable segments.
SFAS 131 also requires disclosures about products and services, geographic
areas, and major customers. The Company operates in one industry segment
comprising the development and marketing of integrated circuits and software
products for use in a variety of video and audio products addressing PC and
consumer multimedia markets.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 SFAS
130, reporting Comprehensive Income.

and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. SFAS 133 establishes a new model for
accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supercedes and amends a
number of existing accounting standards. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives

contracts, primarily with key customers. These development contracts have
provided the Company with partial funding for the development of certain of its
products. The Company classifies costs related to these development contracts as
research and development expenses. The Company is not obligated to repay funding
regardless of the outcome of its development efforts; however, the agreements
require the Company to use its best efforts to achieve specified results as per
the agreements. The Company retains ownership of the intellectual property
developed under the contracts; however, some contracts limit the product markets
in which the Company may directly sell the developed product. Revenues generated
under these contracts were $5,080,000, $1,185,000 and $2,960,000 in 2000, 1999

arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues
contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made
and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management,
there are no pending claims of which the outcome is expected to result in a
material adverse effect in the financial position or results of operations of
the Company.  LEASE COMMITMENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
As of December 31, 2000, the Company has NOLs of approximately $55 million for
federal tax reporting purposes. The federal NOLs expire on various dates between
2001 and 2020. Management has recorded a full valuation allowance against all
U.S. deferred tax assets on the basis that significant uncertainty exists
regarding the realizability of the assets.
Pursuant to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and the benefit from NOLs
that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances,
including a cumulative stock ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year
period. The Company IPO resulted in a cumulative change of ownership of
greater than 50%. Accordingly, the Company NOLs incurred prior to the
completion of the IPO that can be utilized to reduce future taxable income for
federal tax purposes will be limited to approximately $30 million per year.
The Company Israeli subsidiary has been granted the status of an Approved
Enterprise pursuant to the Israeli law for the Encouragement of Capital
Investments, 1959, as amended. The Company has four approved programs pursuant
to this law. The first program was approved in 1984. Income subject to this
program is taxed at an annual rate of 10% from the first year in which the
enterprise generates taxable income net of NOLs. Benefits under the first
program expired in 1997. The second program was approved in 1991. Income subject
to this program is exempt from tax for two years from the first year in which
the Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10%
thereafter. Benefits under the second program expire in 2003. The third program
was approved in 1995. Income subject to this program is exempt from tax for four
years from the first year in which the Company has taxable income net of NOLs
and is taxed at a rate of 10% during the remaining period of six years. The
fourth program was approved in 1997. Income subject to this program is exempt
from tax for two years from the first year in which the Company has taxable
income net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% during the remaining period
of eight years. Benefits under the third and the fourth program are limited to
fourteen years from approval or twelve years from commencement of production.
The net impact of the tax holidays was an increase in net income of $635,000
in fiscal 2000 and an increase in net income per share of $045.

Canada the intellectual property related to its SoftDVD product line and
transferred to MGI certain related software development and support resources
in exchange for cash, MGI common stock and future royalties. The Company
results for the second quarter of 1999 include a $732,000 gain realized from
this transaction which is reported as part of interest and other income or
expense. In connection with this transaction, the Company also recorded a
charge that reduced software, licensing and development revenue for the
quarter by $517,000 for possible issues related to receivables associated
with the SoftDVD product line. The net impact of the MGI transaction on the
Company results was an after-tax gain of $172,000, or $001 per share on a
diluted basis. This gain does not reflect the potential future economic
benefit that may be derived from this transaction and realized in future
periods in the form of royalties. The Company does not currently expect,
however, that these royalties will have a material impact on quarterly
revenues for the foreseeable future. In addition, the shares of MGI stock
received by the Company as part of this transaction are subject to future
appreciation or depreciation. The Company believes that its software revenues
will decline significantly as a result of the sale of the SoftDVD product
line.
PIXELCAM: On June 29, 2000, the Company acquired PixelCam, Inc. PixelCam, a
manufacturer of megapixel CMOS image sensors and integrated lens/sensor modules,
in exchange for 370,832 shares of Zoran common stock and options to purchase
4,168 shares of Zoran common stock with an aggregate value of $246 million. The
common stock issued includes 123,612 shares of restricted stock subject to
repurchase by the Company exchanged for restricted stock of PixelCam. The
restrictions and vesting periods of the PixelCam shares were maintained and will
apply to the converted shares of the Company. The agreement also includes shares
that are contingently issuable to former PixelCam shareholders upon achievement
of certain milestones. Any contingent consideration will be valued and recorded
as of the date the lifting of the contingency becomes probable. The common stock
issued was valued using the average of the market price per share of the
Company common stock for the three trading days prior to the date the
acquisition was consummated. The options were valued using the Black-Scholes
valuation model. The results of operations of PixelCam are included in the
Company financial statements from the date of acquisition.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The
Company had a valuation performed of the in-process research and development and
the intangible assets acquired. The allocation of the purchase price based on
independent appraisal and estimates of fair value and including acquisition
costs of $575,000, is as follows in thousands                    61                 ZORAN CORPORATION

Net assets acquired     $25,224
The net tangible assets acquired were comprised primarily of property and
equipment, inventory, and cash offset by accrued liabilities. The acquired
in-process research and development was written-off in the second quarter of
2000. The estimated weighted average useful life of the intangible assets for
purchased technology, covenant not to compete, acquired employees, patents and
residual goodwill, created as a result of the acquisition of PixelCam, is
approximately three years.
The allocation of $68 million of the purchase price to the acquired in-process
research and development has been determined by identifying the research project
which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative
future uses existed. The value was determined by estimating the expected cash
flows from the project once commercially viable, discounting the net cash flows
back to their present value, and then applying a percentage of completion to the
calculated value as defined below.
NET CASH FLOWS. The net cash flows from the identified project was based on
estimates of revenues, cost of sales, research and development costs, selling,
general and administrative costs, and income taxes from the project. These
estimates were based on the assumptions discussed below. The research and
development costs excluded costs to bring the acquired in-process project to
technological feasibility.
The estimated revenues were based on management projections of the acquired
in-process project. The business projections were compared with and found to be
in line with industry analysts' forecasts of growth in substantially all of the
relevant markets. Estimated total revenues from the acquired in-process research
and development product are expected to peak in fiscal 2002 and decline in
fiscal 2003 as other new products are expected to become available. These
projections were based on estimates of market size and growth, expected trends
in technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions
by the Company and its competitors.
Projected gross margins as well as selling, general and administrative costs
were based on management estimates.
DISCOUNT RATE. Discounting the net cash flows back to their present value was
based on the cost of capital for well managed venture capital funds which
typically have similar risks and returns on investments. The cost of capital
used in discounting the net cash flows from acquired in-process research was
25%.
PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION. The percentage of completion was determined using
costs incurred by PixelCam prior to the acquisition date compared to the
remaining research and development to be completed to bring the project to
technological feasibility. The Company estimated, as of the acquisition date,
the project was 62% complete and the estimated costs to complete the project
were approximately $41 million.
The Company expects to complete the project within 12 months from the
acquisition date. However, development of this project remains a significant
risk to the Company due to the remaining effort to achieve technical
feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets and significant competitive
threats from numerous companies. Failure to bring these products to market in a
timely manner could adversely impact sales and profitability of the Company in
the future. Additionally, the value of the intangible assets acquired may become
impaired.                    62                 ZORAN CORPORATION

shares of Zoran common stock with a fair value of $1544 million and options
to purchase 168,472 shares of Zoran common stock with a fair value of $92
million. The common stock issued was valued using the average of the market
price per share of the Company common stock on the date the proposed merger
was announced and the three trading days before and two trading days
subsequent to the date of the announcement. The options were valued using the
Black-Scholes valuation mode. The results of operations of Nogatech are
included in the Company financial statements from the date of acquisition.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
The Company had a valuation performed of the in-process research and

The net tangible assets acquired were comprised primarily of cash, inventory,

research and development was written-off in the fourth quarter of 2000. The
intangible assets for core technology, assembled workforce, customer base and
residual goodwill, created as a result fo the acquisition of Nogatech will be
amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of three
years. The completed technology will be amortized on a straight line basis over
