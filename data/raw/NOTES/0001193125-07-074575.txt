BJS WHOLESALE CLUB, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  A.Summary of Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation  The consolidated financial statements of BJs Wholesale Club, Inc. BJs or the Company or we include the financial statements of all of the Companys subsidiaries, all of whose common
stock is wholly owned by the Company.  Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to
January31. The fiscal year ended February3, 2007 included 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended January28, 2006 and January29, 2005 each included 52 weeks. A majority of our income and expense items were affected directly by the
53rd week in 2006. These would include sales, gross profit, inventory shrinkage, membership fee revenues, gasoline income, payroll, payroll benefits, utilities, and all other variable club operating expenses. Expenses that were not affected by the
53rd week included rent, common area maintenance, depreciation and real estate taxes.  Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  We consider highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities exceeding three months are classified as marketable securities.
Our marketable securities, which consist of high-grade debt
securities issued by state governmental agencies or their political subdivisions, are classified as available for sale and are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash flow activity represents auction rate securities in 2004 and 2005,
and hedging activity in 2006.  Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist primarily of credit card
receivables and vendor rebates and allowances and are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $1,315,000 at February3, 2007 and $879,000 at January28, 2006. The determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on
BJs historical experience applied to an aging of accounts and a review of individual accounts with a known potential for write-off.  Merchandise Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined under the average cost method, or market. We recognize the write-down of slow-moving or obsolete
inventory in cost of sales when such write-downs are probable and estimable. We recognize a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the period between physical inventories based on historical results of previous physical inventories, shrinkage trends or
other judgments management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Property and Equipment  Property is depreciated by use of the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.
Depreciation is classified in cost of sales, including buying and occupying costs. Buildings are depreciated over 331/3 years. Leasehold costs and improvements are amortized over the required lease term which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. Leasehold costs and improvements
that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term are amortized over the term that includes the required lease term and renewal periods that are reasonably assured, or their estimated
useful life, whichever is shorter. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over three to ten years. Interest related to the development of buildings is capitalized to the extent that debt is incurred during the construction period.
Normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred. 
31  Impairment of Long-lived Assets  We review the realizability of our long-lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Current and expected operating results and cash flows and other factors are considered in connection with our reviews. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the
recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows of individual clubs and consolidated net cash flows for long-lived assets not identifiable to individual clubs. Impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying
amount and the fair value of the impaired assets.  We recorded
pretax asset impairment charges of $8,747,000 in 2006, $13,000 in 2005 and $2,387,000 in 2004 to write down leasehold improvements and certain fixtures and equipment to fair value at underperforming clubs that were projected to have future cash flow
losses. The fair value of the assets was based primarily on past experience in disposing of similar assets. Asset impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Self-Insurance Reserves  We are primarily self-insured for workers compensation and general
liability claims. Reported reserves for these claims are derived from estimated ultimate costs based upon individual claim file reserves and estimates for incurred but not reported claims.  Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise, net of estimated returns,
at the time of purchase by the customer in the club. In the limited instances when the customer is not able to take delivery at the point of sale, revenue from the sale of merchandise is not recognized until title and risk of loss pass to the
customer. For sales of merchandise on our website, revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is normally at the time the merchandise is received by the customer. Membership fee revenue is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the membership, which is typically twelve months.  In determining comparable club information, we include all clubs that were open for at least 13 months at the beginning of the period and were in operation during all of both periods being compared. However, if a club
is in the process of closing, it is excluded from comparable clubs. We include relocated clubs and expansions in comparable clubs.  The year ended February3, 2007 was a 53-week year. Sales for the 53 weeks ended February3, 2007 were compared with sales for the 53 weeks
ended February4, 2006 to determine comparable club sales information for the fiscal 2006 year.  Vendor Rebates and Allowances  We receive various types of cash consideration from vendors, principally in the form of rebates based on purchasing or selling certain volumes of product;
time-based rebates or allowances, which may include product placement allowances or exclusivity arrangements covering a predetermined period of time; price protection rebates and allowances for retail reductions on certain merchandise; and salvage
allowances for product that is damaged, defective or becomes out-of-date. We recognize such vendor rebates and allowances based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to the underlying transaction that results in
progress by BJs toward earning the rebates and allowances, provided the amounts to be earned are probable and reasonably estimable. Otherwise, rebates and allowances are recognized only when predetermined milestones are met. We recognize
product placement allowances as a reduction of cost of sales in the period in which we complete the arranged placement of the product. Time-based rebates or allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales over the performance period on a
straight-line basis. All other vendor rebates and allowances are realized as a reduction of cost of sales when the merchandise is sold or otherwise disposed. 
32  We also receive cash consideration from vendors for demonstrating their products in the clubs and for
advertising their products, particularly in the BJs Journal, a publication sent to BJs members throughout the year. In both cases, such cash consideration is recognized as a reduction of selling, general and administrative
SGA expenses to the extent it represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable SGA costs incurred by BJs to sell the vendors products. If the cash consideration exceeds the costs being
reimbursed, the excess is characterized as a reduction of cost of sales. Cash consideration for product demonstrations is recognized in the period during which the demonstrations are performed. Cash consideration for advertising vendors
products is recognized in the period in which the advertising takes place.  Manufacturers Incentives Tendered by Consumers  At the beginning of 2004, we adopted the provisions of EITF Issue No03-10, Application of EITF Issue No02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers EITF
03-10, which provides guidance for the reporting of vendor consideration received by a reseller as it relates to manufacturers incentives such as rebates or coupons tendered by consumers. We include such vendor consideration in
revenues only if all of the criteria defined in EITF 03-10 are met. Otherwise, such consideration is recorded as a decrease in cost of sales.  Rent Expenses  Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
leases. We begin recognizing rent expense in the preopening period when we take possession of the club. Our owned buildings, including those located on leased land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 331/3 years. We calculate rent for ground leases over periods that equal or exceed the time periods for depreciation of
the buildings, which would include reasonably assured lease renewal periods.  Preopening Costs  Preopening costs consist of direct incremental costs of opening or relocating a facility and are charged to operations as incurred.  Advertising Costs  Advertising costs generally consist of promoting new memberships and new store openings and also include during the holiday season television and radio
advertising some of which is vendor-funded. BJs expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses were less than 040% of total sales in each of the last three years.  Legal Costs  Legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are recognized at the same time that the loss contingency is recorded.
Stock-Based Compensation  As of February3, 2007, we had two stock-based employee compensation
plans, which are described more fully in Note H. We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123R as of January29, 2006, the beginning of the first quarter
of 2006. We used the modified prospective application MPA transition method in implementing the new standard. Under the MPA method we are recognizing share-based compensation cost for all awards granted on or after the adoption date
and for any portion of awards granted before the adoption date that had not vested by the date we adopted SFAS 123R. Measurement and attribution of compensation cost for those existing awards are based on the original grant-date fair value and the
same attribution methods we used for pro forma disclosure under Statement of 
33  
Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123 in prior years. As of the adoption date, we have
discontinued our past practice of recognizing forfeitures only as they occur, and during the remaining vesting period, we will estimate forfeitures for those earlier awards and will true up our estimates so that compensation cost is recognized only
for awards that vest. We will evaluate the need to change our forfeiture estimates at the end of each quarter and will true up our estimates at the end of each fiscal year. Because we are using the MPA method, we are not restating prior year
financial statements.  In prior years, the excess tax benefit
from the exercise of stock options was presented in the operating activities section of our statements of cash flows. Effective with the adoption date of SFAS 123R, such excess tax benefits are being classified in the financing activities section
of the cash flow statement. If applicable, gross tax shortfalls are being classified in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement.  The effect of the change from applying the original provisions of SFAS 123 in 2006 was the following dollars in thousands except per share amounts:
Increase decrease in Income from continuing operations before income taxes 15,987 Income from continuing operations 9,464 Net income 9,464 Cash flow from operating activities 2,754 Cash flow from financing activities 2,754 Earnings per share Basic 014 Diluted 014
Prior to 2006, we
accounted for stock-based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost for
stock options was reflected in net income, as all options granted under our plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant. We did include stock-based employee compensation cost for
restricted stock in net income. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation in 2005 and 2004:  Fiscal Year Ended January28,2006 January29,2005 DollarsinThousandsexceptPer Share Amounts Net income, as reported 128,533 114,401 Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 800 412 Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax

34  Most of BJs stock option awards specify that eligible participants whose employment terminates on
or after their normal retirement date as defined may exercise options within the period of one year following their termination. Shares shall continue to become exercisable during this period in accordance with the stock option agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, options shall in no event be exercisable after the final exercise date. For pro forma reporting purposes under SFAS No123, we recognized compensation cost for this type of arrangement over the nominal vesting
period the nominal vesting period approach. Issue 19 of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-23, Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB 25 and FIN 44, EITF 00-23 and paragraph 27 of SFAS 123
specify that an award is vested when the employees retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service the non-substantive vesting period approach.  We will continue to follow the nominal vesting period approach for the
remaining portion of unvested outstanding awards granted prior to adopting SFAS 123R. Upon adopting SFAS 123R, we are applying the non-substantive vesting period approach described in paragraphs A57-58 of SFAS 123R to new grants that have
retirement eligibility provisions. Applying the non-substantive vesting period approach instead of the nominal vesting period approach would have decreased post-tax stock option expense by $07 million in 2006 and increased post-tax stock option
expense by approximately $11 million in 2005 and approximately $10million in 2004.  Our pro forma disclosures did not include capitalized stock-based compensation costs because such amounts were not material.  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amount of long-term debt, including current installments, was $2,736,000 and $3,197,000 as of February3, 2007 and January28,
2006, respectively. The fair value of this debt was $2,788,000 and $3,342,000 as of February3, 2007 and January28, 2006, respectively. Fair value was based on our estimate of current rates on debt with similar remaining maturities for
companies with credit ratings similar to BJs.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  The
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued the following standards which become effective in 2007 and future periods:  FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48 was issued in July 2006. FIN 48 provides guidance for the
recognition, derecognition and measurement in financial statements of tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or tax positions expected to be taken in tax returns. FIN 48 requires an entity to recognize the financial statement impact of
a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. If the tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the tax effect is recognized at the largest amount of the benefit that is
greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 requires that a liability created for unrecognized tax benefits shall be presented as a liability and not combined with deferred tax liabilities or assets. The
application of FIN 48 may also affect the tax bases of assets and liabilities and therefore may change or create deferred tax liabilities or assets. We believe that the adoption of FIN 48 will require the reclassification of certain deferred tax
liabilities or assets to a liability for tax uncertainties. FIN 48 permits an entity to recognize interest related to tax uncertainties as either income taxes or interest expense. FIN 48 also permits an entity to recognize penalties related to tax
uncertainties as either income tax expense or within other expense classifications. We have recognized interest and penalties, if any, related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense and will continue this treatment upon adoption of FIN 48. We
are required to adopt FIN 48 as of the first quarter of fiscal 2007, with any cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. We estimate that this charge to retained earnings will be
approximately $60 million. 
35  In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 06-3, How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation. In accordance with EITF 06-3, the presentation of taxes within the scope of this issue on either a gross included in revenues and
costs or a net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to APB Opinion 22. EITF 06-3 becomes effective in the first quarter of the fiscal 2007 financial statements fiscal year beginning
February4, 2007. We plan to present taxes within the scope of this issue on a net basis, and therefore, implementation of EITF 06-3 should not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.  FASB Statement No157, Fair Value Measurement FASB 157 was issued in September 2006. FASB 157 provides a definition of fair value,
provides guidance for measuring fair value in U.S. GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FASB 157 will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2008. We are presently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FASB 157 on our
results of operations and financial position.  FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities FASB
159 was issued in February 2007. FASB 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value. FASB 159 will be effective at the beginning of
fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FASB 159 on our results of operations and financial position.  Reclassifications  We have reclassified our prior financial statements to reflect the operating results of ProFoods in discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Certain amounts in the prior years financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In the statements of cash flows, we reclassified book overdrafts from cash flows from financing activities to cash flows from operating activities. See Note O.  We issue shares from BJs treasury in connection with exercises of stock
options and issuances of restricted stock. It has been our practice to credit our treasury stock account with an offsetting charge to additional paid-in capital APIC for these transactions. During this years second quarter, we discovered
that the offsetting charge should have been made to retained earnings because the amounts paid by employees pursuant to stock option exercises and receipt of restricted stock was less than the carrying cost of the treasury stock issued to the
employees. As of the end of this years first quarter, APIC was understated and retained earnings were overstated by the same amount. Beginning with this years second quarter financial statements, we have revised the classification of
these amounts to properly state the balances of APIC and retained earnings for all periods presented. Had these transactions been recorded correctly, APIC would have increased and retained earnings would have decreased by $198 million, $112
million and $225 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, APIC and retained earnings would have been adjusted by $678 million prior to 2004. The amounts above have been reclassified in the financial statements. The revised
classifications have no effect on earnings, cash flows or total stockholders equity, nor do they affect the Companys compliance with debt covenants or other contractual requirements.  Estimates Included in Financial Statements  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
36  B.Spin-off of the Company from Waban Inc. and Related Party Transactions  The Company, which previously had been a wholly owned subsidiary of Waban,
became a separate and independent public entity on July28, 1997, when Waban distributed to its stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the Companys outstanding common stock the spin-off.  C.Discontinued Operations, Restructuring Activities and Asset

In October 2004, we began testing a concept that was new to BJs by opening the first of two new clubs in the Metro New York market exclusively for food service businesses
under the name ProFoods Restaurant Supply. Our second ProFoods club was opened in January 2005. The business model for ProFoods was built on somewhat higher merchandise margins than those generated by a wholesale club, free memberships
and a broad merchandise assortment to support one-stop shopping, primarily on a cash and carry basis. We considered ProFoods as a new venture that would take time to develop. The ProFoods clubs did not perform fully to our expectations. On January
4, 2007, we announced our plans to close both of these clubs.  Both ProFoods clubs were closed by the end of the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2007. The operating results of these clubs are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Interest accretion
charges of $232,000 are also included in discontinued operations. ProFoods incurred net losses of $5,460,000, $6,564,000 and $3,030,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenues for ProFoods were $43,811,000, $35,831,000 and $4,273,000 in 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The pretax loss of $25,673,000 $15,198,000 post-tax to close these clubs in the fourth quarter of 2006 consisted mainly of fixed asset write-downs of $140 million, lease obligation costs of $88 million and $10
million for employee termination benefits.  The charges for
lease obligations were based on the present value of rent liabilities under the two leases, including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges, reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties. An annual
discount rate of 6% was used to calculate the present value of the obligations. The liabilities for the closed club leases are included in current and noncurrent closed store lease obligations on our balance sheet.  2
On November 9, 2002, we closed both of our clubs in the Columbus, Ohio, market and an older non-prototypical club in North Dade, Florida. The operating results of
these clubs are presented in discontinued 
37  
operations in the statements of income for all periods presented. In 2002, we recorded pretax club closing costs of $21,387,000 $12,832,000 post-tax and
pretax operating losses of $3,405,000 $2,111,000 post-tax. There were no revenues after 2002.  In 2004, we made a lump sum payment to settle the lease for one of the clubs that closed in 2002. Based on the settlement and an evaluation of the status
of the two remaining clubs, we recorded a pretax charge of $2,853,000 to increase our reserve for closed clubs in 2004. Including pretax accretion charges of $785,000, the pretax loss from discontinued operations for these clubs totaled $3,638,000
in 2004.  In 2005, we settled the lease for one of the closed
BJs clubs through a lump sum settlement. The settlement was consistent with the amount which we had reserved for this club. Loss from discontinued operations in 2005 included interest accretion charges of $514,000 pretax $309,000 post-tax.
The liabilities for the closed club leases are included in current and noncurrent closed store lease obligations on our balance sheet.  In 2006, we incurred interest accretion charges of $487,000.

On January 4, 2007, we announced our plans to close all 46 in-club pharmacies because of their disappointing sales and profitability results, lower than expected growth in new
prescriptions and because of an increasingly competitive landscape. Fourteen of our pharmacies were closed by the end of the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2007. The last of the remaining pharmacies closed on February 21, 2007. The operating
results of the pharmacies are included in continuing operations. The fourth quarter pretax loss of $7,193,000 $4,258,000 post-tax to close the pharmacies consisted mainly of fixed asset write-downs of $42 million and employee termination benefits
of $27 million, offset partially by income from the sale of prescription files and inventory to other pharmacy operators of $09 million. These losses are included in SGA expenses. In the first quarter of 2007, we will incur additional costs
to de-install fixtures and payroll and fringe benefits in connection with the closing of the remaining pharmacies. The costs are expected to be largely offset by the additional sale of prescription files and inventory to other pharmacy operators.
The liability for these charges is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.  2
We relocated our Franklin, MA, cross-dock facility to a new facility in Uxbridge, MA, in July 2006. In connection with vacating the Franklin cross-dock, we recorded charges in 2006
of $2,354,000 $14 million post-tax for our remaining lease obligations for this property. These charges were based on our rent liabilities under the lease, reduced by estimated sublease income for this property. The charges were recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses. The liability for this facility is included in current and noncurrent closed store lease obligations in the balance sheet. 
38  Asset Impairments  We recorded pretax asset impairment charges of $8,747,000 in 2006, $13,000 in 2005 and $2,387,000 in 2004 to write down
leasehold improvements and certain fixtures and equipment to fair value at underperforming clubs that were projected to have future cash flow losses. The fair value of the assets was based primarily on past experience in disposing of similar assets.
Asset impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  D.Debt  As of
February3, 2007, long-term debt, less the portion due within one year, consisted entirely of real estate debt, bearing interest at 7%, maturing through November1, 2011. The aggregate maturities of long-term debt outstanding at
February3, 2007 were as follows:  Fiscal Years Ending

January28, 2012 539 Total 2,243  Real estate debt was
collateralized by land and buildings with a net book value of $10,347,000.  We have a $225 million unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks which expires April27, 2010. The agreement includes a $50 million sub-facility for letters of credit, of which no amount was outstanding at
February3, 2007. We are required to pay an annual facility fee which is currently 015% of the total commitment. Interest on borrowings is payable at BJs option either at athe Eurodollar rate plus a margin which is currently
0475% or ba rate equal to the higher of ithe sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 050% or iithe agent banks prime rate. We are also required to pay a usage fee whenever the amount of loans and undrawn or
unreimbursed letters of credit outstanding exceeds 50% of the total commitment. The usage fee, if applicable, would currently be at an annual rate of 0125% of the amount borrowed. The facility fee and Eurodollar margin are subject to change based
upon our fixed charge coverage ratio. The agreement contains financial covenants which include a minimum fixed charge coverage requirement and a maximum adjusted debt to capital limitation. We are required to comply with these covenants on a
quarterly basis. Under the credit agreement, we may pay dividends or repurchase our own stock in any amount so long as we remain in compliance with all requirements under the agreement.  In addition to the credit agreement, we maintain a separate $82 million facility for letters of credit, primarily to support
the purchase of inventories, of which $359 million was outstanding at February3, 2007, and also maintain a $25 million uncommitted credit line for short-term borrowings which expires on April30, 2007. As of February3, 2007, we
also had a stand-alone letter of credit in the amount of $57 million outstanding, which is used to support our self-insurance program for workers compensation.  There were no borrowings outstanding under our bank credit agreement or our uncommitted credit line at February3, 2007
and January28, 2006.  E.Commitments and
Contingencies  We are obligated under long-term leases for
the rental of real estate. In addition, we are generally required to pay insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses and, in some cases, additional rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of certain amounts, or other factors.
Many of our leases require escalating payments 
39  
during the lease term. Rent expense for such leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The initial primary term of our real estate
leases excluding ground leases ranges from 4 to 25 years. Most of these leases have an initial term of 20 years. The initial primary term of our ground leases ranges from 15 to 44 years, and averages approximately 25 years. As of February3,
2007, we have options to renew all but two of our leases for periods that range from 5 to 50 years, and average approximately 21 years. Future minimum lease payments as of February3, 2007 were:  Fiscal Years Ending

Later years 1,553,775 Total 2,266,413  We corrected our
methods of accounting related to the timing of rent expense recognition at our leased locations, and for recognizing rent expenses for certain of our ground leases, in the fourth quarter of 2004. As a result of these changes, we recorded cumulative,
non-cash charges of $57 million to begin recognizing rent expenses when we take possession of our clubs, and $14 million to adjust rent for our ground leases, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Of the $71 million recorded for these charges, $475,000
was related to 2004 and the remainder was related to prior years. The effect of this adjustment was to increase preopening expenses by $81million and to decrease cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, by $10 million in 2004.
See Note A, Summary of Accounting Policies Property and Equipment and Rent Expenses for additional information.  The payments above do not include future payments due under the leases for two ProFoods clubs and one cross-dock facility, which closed in 2006, and one
BJs club which closed in November 2002. Rent liabilities for the closed locations are included in the balance sheet see Note C for additional information.  Rental expense under operating leases including contingent rentals, which were not material amounted to $131,725,000 120,197,000 and $114,984,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Rental expense in 2004 included corrections to our accounting for leases of $72 million, $67 million of which was related to prior years.  We are involved in various legal proceedings that are typical of a retail
business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings or any related claims, we believe that such proceedings or claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations.  BJs filed proofs of claim
against House2Home, Inc. for claims arising under certain agreements between BJs and House2Home in connection with BJs spin-off from Waban Inc. in July 1997. These claims arose primarily from BJs indemnification of TJX with respect
to TJXs guarantee of House2Home leases and from the Tax Sharing Agreement dated July28, 1997 between BJs and House2Home. House2Home and BJs have settled BJs claims against House2Home. As part of the settlement,
BJs has been released of all claims that House2Home and its bankruptcy estate may have had against BJs.  In March 2006, we received bankruptcy recoveries of $31 million on account of our House2Home bankruptcy claims. On a post-tax basis, these gains were
$21 million. The Bankruptcy Court has closed our case and we do not expect to receive further payments on our claims. In 2005 and 2004, we received pretax recoveries on account of our House2Home bankruptcy claims of $44 million $30 million
post-tax and $70 million $46million post-tax, respectively. These recoveries are recorded in gain on contingent lease obligations in the statements of income. 
40  As permitted by Delaware law, BJs has entered into agreements whereby it indemnifies its directors
and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving, at the Companys request, in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments that BJs could be required to make under these
agreements is not limited. However, BJs carries directors and officers insurance that covers its exposure up to certain limits. As a result of our insurance coverage, we believe that the estimated fair value of our indemnification
agreements with directors and officers is minimal. No liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of February3, 2007.  In 2002, we began to offer an extended warranty on tires sold at our clubs, under which BJs customers receive tire repair services or tire
replacement in certain circumstances. We have insured this liability through a third party and, therefore, retain no liability in connection with the tire warranty program other than for the premiums paid to the third-party carrier.  F.Provision for Credit Card Claims  Early in 2004 we were notified by credit card issuers that credit and
debit card accounts used legitimately at BJs were subsequently used in fraudulent transactions at non-BJs locations. In response, we retained a leading computer security firm to conduct a forensic analysis of our information technology
systems with a goal of determining whether a breach had in fact occurred. While no conclusive evidence of a breach was found, the computer security firm concluded that: 1our centralized computer system that serves as the aggregation point
for all BJs credit and debit card transactions chain-wide had not been breached and 2any breach would have likely occurred in a more decentralized fashion involving club-level systems. On March12, 2004, after our receipt of the
computer security firms preliminary report of findings, we issued a public statement alerting consumers to the potential security breach.  In 2004, we recorded charges of $70 million $42 million post-tax to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for fraudulent credit and
debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards, monitoring expenses and related fees and expenses.  In 2005 and 2006, we recorded additional charges of $40 million $24 million post-tax and $20 million $12 million post-tax, respectively, to
increase our reserve. These additional charges were driven primarily by an increase in our estimate of legal costs to be incurred in connection with this matter. As of February3, 2007, the balance in the reserve was $54 million, which
represented our best estimate of the remaining cost and expenses related to this matter at that time. This reserve is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our balance sheet.  As of March31, 2007, the amount of outstanding claims, which are
primarily from credit card issuing banks, was approximately $13 million. We are unable to predict whether further claims will be asserted. We have contested and will continue to vigorously contest the claims made against us and continue to explore
our defenses and possible claims against others.  The ultimate
outcome of this matter could differ from the amounts recorded. While that difference could be material to the results of operations for any affected reporting period, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position or liquidity.  G.Capital Stock
During 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of an additional $100 million of the Companys common stock in addition to the $500 million previously authorized. We repurchased 4,166,048 shares of our common stock for $118,446,000 in 2006, 2,535,600 shares for $73,234,000 in 2005
and 1,725,200 shares for $45,318,000 in 2004. As of February3, 2007, the Companys remaining repurchase authorization was $53,459,000.  BJs has a shareholder rights plan, originally adopted in 1997 and amended in 1999 and in 2003 solely to appoint a new rights agent, pursuant to
which shareholders are issued one-half of a Right for each share of 
41  
common stock. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company 1/1000 share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock Series A
Preferred Stock at a price of $120. BJs has designated 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for issuance under the shareholder rights plan; none has been issued to date. Generally, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are
designed so that 1/1000 share of Series A Preferred Stock is the economic equivalent of one share of BJs common stock. The Rights are exercisable only if a person acquires 20% or more of the Companys common stock or commences a tender
offer that would result in such person owning 30% or more of the Companys common stock. In addition, in general, if after a person has become a 20% owner, BJs is involved in a business combination transaction in which it is not the
surviving corporation or in connection with which the BJs common stock is changed, or BJs disposes of 50% or more of its assets or earning power, each Right that has not previously been exercised or voided will entitle its holder to
purchase that number of shares of common stock of such other person which equals $120 divided by one-half of the then current market price of such common stock. BJs will generally be entitled to redeem the Rights at $01 per Right at any time
until the tenth business day following public announcement that a person has become a 20% owner. The Rights expire on July10, 2007, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged.  The Company has authorized 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $01 par value, of which no shares have been issued.
In December 1997, one of BJs subsidiaries issued 126
shares of non-voting preferred stock to individual stockholders, at $2,200 per share. These shares are entitled to receive ongoing annual dividends of $200 per share. The minority interest in this subsidiary is equal to the preferred shares
preference in an involuntary liquidation of $277,200 and is included in other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at February3, 2007 and January28, 2006.  H. Stock Incentive Plans  Under its 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, BJs has granted certain key employees and directors options to purchase common stock at prices equal to 100% of
market price on the grant date. These options, which generally expire ten years from the grant date, are generally exercisable 25%per year starting one year after the grant date. Options granted to non-employee directors expire ten years from
the grant date, but are exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the first day of the month which includes the first anniversary of the date of grant. At the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2004, an amendment
to increase the maximum number of shares issuable under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan by 4,000,000 shares was approved. Certain sub-limits were also approved for awards from and after the date of the 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including a
limit of 1,000,000 shares with respect to awards other than options and stock appreciation rights and a limit of 300,000 shares with respect to awards granted to non-employee directors. The maximum number of shares of common stock issuable under
this plan is now 11,249,402 shares, plus shares subject to awards granted under the BJs Wholesale Club, Inc. 1997 Replacement Stock Incentive Plan the Replacement Plan which are not actually issued because such awards expire or
are canceled. Under the Replacement Plan, BJs employees who held Waban stock options and restricted stock were granted replacement BJs options and restricted stock, which preserved the same inherent value, vesting terms and expiration
dates as the Waban awards they replaced in connection with the spin-off. No new options could be granted under the Replacement Plan after January28, 1998. 
As of February3, 2007 and January28, 2006, respectively, 1,677,087 and 1,896,691 shares were reserved for all future stock awards under
BJs stock incentive plans. As of February3, 2007 and January28, 2006, respectively, of the total shares reserved, a maximum of 597,249 and 847,000 shares were reserved for awards other than options and stock appreciation rights,
and a maximum of 175,000 and 220,000 shares were reserved for awards for non-employee directors. No new awards can be granted under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan after July 27, 2007.  Total share-based compensation recognized in the financial statements was $185 million $109 million post-tax in the
fiscal year ended February3, 2007 and $13 million $08 million post-tax in the fiscal year ended January28, 2006 and $07 million $04 million post-tax in the fiscal year ended January29, 2005. 
42  The fair value of BJs stock options was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions no dividends were expected:  Fiscal Year Ended February3, 2007 January28, 2006 January29, 2005 Risk-free interest rate 475 373 346 Expected volatility factor 370 375 460 Expected option life yrs. 55 50 49 Weighted-average grant-date fair value 1264 1167 1118
Expected volatility
for the year ended February3, 2007 was based on a combination of implied volatility from traded options on our stock and historical volatility of our stock, 75% of our overall volatility assumption was based on a review of BJs daily
stock price volatility over the last five years. 25% was based on the implied volatility of near at-the-money exchange-traded options. Expected volatility for the years ended January28, 2006 and January29, 2005 was based on historical
volatility of our stock and, to a lesser extent, a review of peer companies. We use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model. The expected option life represents an estimate of the
period of time options are expected to remain outstanding based upon historical option exercise trends. The risk-free rate is for periods within the expected life of the option and is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
the grant.  Presented below is a summary of the status of stock

During the fourth
quarter of the current fiscal year, we elected the Short Cut method of FSP FAS 123R-3 to calculate our historical pool of windfall tax benefits. Prior to electing this method, we assumed the use of the Long-form method as
described in FAS 123R. This policy election did not impact income from continuing operations or net income, and did not require an adjustment to cumulative retained earnings. The excess windfall tax benefit from exercise of stock options reported
as an inflow in financing and an outflow in operating activities would have been $17 million if calculated under the long form method.

of restricted shares vested was $04 million in the year ended February3, 2007, $02million in the year ended January28, 2006 and $01 million in the year ended January29, 2005.  As of February3, 2007, there was $218 million of total share-based
compensation cost related to nonvested awards not yet recognized. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 16 years.  Restricted stock awards are issued at no cost to the recipients and have service restrictions that generally lapse over three to four years from date of
grant. Grant-date fair value of the award is charged to income ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.  The Company had one modification of stock awards in 2006. Under the terms of a Severance Agreement and General Release dated as of November 22, 2006 the
Severance Agreement entered into by Michael T. Wedge and the Company, Mr. Wedge resigned from his employment with the Company, including his positions as the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer, and as a member of the
Companys Board of Directors, effective November 22, 2006.  The Severance Agreement provides for accelerated vesting of any unvested outstanding option grants, except to the extent that the terms of such options already expressly provided for continued vesting of any portion of the grant following
Mr. Wedges termination of employment. Because Mr. Wedge is deemed to have retired from the Company under the terms of his outstanding stock options, all of his options will remain outstanding for one year. In connection with the Severance
Agreement, the Company incurred incremental pretax expense of $1,126,000 and accelerated expense of $591,000 in the fourth quarter of 2006.

2007,January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares
for the years then ended.  J.Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes includes the following:

established a valuation allowance because our deferred tax assets can be utilized by offsetting deferred tax liabilities and future taxable income, which management believes will more likely than not be earned, based on our historical earnings
record and projected future earnings.  K.Retirement
Plans  Under BJs 401k Savings plans, participating
employees may make pretax contributions up to 50% of covered compensation. BJs matches employee contributions at 100% of the first one percent of covered compensation and 50% of the next four percent. The Companys expense under these
plans was $5,589,000, $4,903,000 and $4,177,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  We have a non-contributory defined contribution retirement plan for certain key employees. Under this plan, BJs funds annual retirement contributions for the designated participants on an after-tax basis. For
the last three years, the Companys contributions equaled 5% of the participants base salary. Participants become fully vested in their contribution accounts at the end of the fiscal year in which they complete four years of service. Our
pretax expense under this plan was $1,060,000, $1,565,000 and $1,441,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  L.Postretirement Medical Benefits  We have a defined benefit postretirement medical plan which covers employees and their spouses who retire after age 55 with at least 10 years of service,
who are not eligible for Medicare, and who participated in a Company-sponsored medical plan. Amounts contributed by retired employees under this plan are based on years 
46  
of service prior to retirement. The plan is not funded. The discount rates presented in the tables below were selected by referencing yields on high quality
corporate bonds, including Moodys Aa Corporate Bond Rate and the Citigroup Pension Yield Curve.  The following tables are presented in accordance with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined

The terms of the settlement require VISA and MasterCard to pay $305 billion into a settlement fund that will be distributed to class members.
We are a member of the class and are entitled to a portion of the fund. In 2005, we received a settlement offer related to the distribution of the fund. Based upon information contained in the settlement offer, we recorded a $31 million pretax
estimated recovery as a reduction to SGA expenses in 2005. On a post-tax basis, this recovery was $19 million. In 2006, we received cash recoveries totaling $33 million. As a result we recorded a pretax gain of $02 million as a reduction of
SGA in 2006.  O.Accounts Payable
Our banking arrangements provide for the daily
replenishment of vendor payable bank accounts as checks are presented. The balances of checks outstanding in these bank accounts totaling $82,406,000 at February3, 2007 and $77,357,000 at January28, 2006, which represent book overdrafts,
are included in accounts payable on the balance sheets and the changes in these balances are reflected in operating activities in the statements of cash flows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BJs Wholesale Club, Inc.:  We have completed integrated audits of BJs Wholesale Club, Inc.s
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of February3, 2007, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits,
are presented below.  Consolidated financial statements  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index,present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BJs Wholesale Club, Inc. and its subsidiaries at February3, 2007 and January28, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended February3, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  As discussed in
Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation during the fiscal year-ended February 3, 2007.  Internal control over financial reporting 
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
Item8, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February3, 2007 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of February3, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made 
53  
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  /S/ PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts April 4, 2007  
MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  BJs management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of February3, 2007. In making
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of
February3, 2007, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Companys assessment of the effectiveness of its
internal controls over financial reporting as of February3, 2007 as stated in their report, which appears herein.  April 4, 2007 
54  Item1B.Unresolved Staff Comments  None.  Item2.Controls and Procedures  The Companys management, with the participation of the Companys
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of February3, 2007. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules
13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of February3, 2007, the Companys chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  Managements report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f under the Exchange Act and the independent registered public accounting firms related audit report are included in Item8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.  No change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting
occurred during the fiscal quarter ended February3, 2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B.Other Information  Not applicable.
