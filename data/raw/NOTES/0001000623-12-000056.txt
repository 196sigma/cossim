GeneralNature of BusinessSchweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc., or SWM or the Company, is a multinational diversified producer of premium specialty papers headquartered in the United States of America. The Company manufactures and sells paper and reconstituted tobacco products to the tobacco industry as well as specialized paper products for use in other applications. The Companys tobacco-related products include cigarette, plug wrap and base tipping papers, or Cigarette Papers, used to wrap various parts of a cigarette, reconstituted tobacco leaf, or RTL, which is used as a blend with virgin tobacco in cigarettes and reconstituted tobacco wrappers and binders for machine-made cigars. These products are sold directly to the major tobacco companies or their designated converters in the Americas, Europe, Asia and elsewhere. Non-tobacco industry products are a diverse mix of products, certain of which represent commodity paper grades produced to maximize machine operations.The Company is a manufacturer of high porosity papers, which are used in manufacturing ventilated cigarettes, banded and print banded papers for the production of lower ignition propensity, or LIP, cigarettes and the leading independent producer of RTL used in producing blended cigarettes. The Company conducts business in over 90countries and currently operates 11production locations worldwide, with mills in the United States, France, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil and Poland. The Company also has a 50%equity interest in twojoint ventures in China.As used in this 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context indicates otherwise, references to we, us, our, SWM, Schweitzer-Mauduit or similar terms include Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are reasonable, based upon currently available facts and known circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions as a result of a number of factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this report and in its other public filings from time to time.ReclassificationsIn the Operations section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, excess tax benefits of stock-based awards of $16 millionand $33 million, respectively, have been reclassified to a separate new line item from changes in Accrued Income Taxes to conform to the current year financial statement presentation. On the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Deferred Revenue has been reclassified to Accrued Expenses to conform to current year financial statement presentation.Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company did not have any special purpose entities during 2011, 2010or 2009.The Company has twojoint ventures with China National Tobacco Corporation, or CNTC. CNTC is the principal operating Company under China State Tobacco Monopoly Administration. CNTC and our subsidiary, SM-China, each own 50%of the joint ventures. The paper joint venture China Tobacco Mauduit Jiangmen Paper Industry Co. LTD, or CTM, produces tobacco-related papers in China. The second joint venture China Tobacco Schweitzer Yunnan Reconstituted Tobacco Co. LTD., or CTS, will produce reconstituted tobacco leaf products. The Company uses the equity method to account for both joint ventures. Investment in equity affiliates represents the Company investment in its China joint ventures. The Company 50%share of the net income is included in the consolidated statements of income as income from equity affiliates55Table of ContentsRevenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue and the related accounts receivable when the following four criteria are met: 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2 ownership has transferred to the customer; 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable; and 4 collection is reasonably assured based on the Company judgment regarding the collectability of its accounts receivable. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue when it ships its manufactured product and title and risk of loss passes to its customer in accordance with the terms of sale of the product. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated f.o.b., or free on board, shipping point. For sales transactions designated f.o.b. destination, revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer delivery site, at which time title and risk of loss are transferred. Provisions for discounts, returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue is recorded. Deferred revenue represents advance payments from customers which are earned based upon a mutually agreed-upon amount per unit of future product sales.Freight CostsThe cost of delivering finished goods to the Company customers is recorded as a component of cost of products sold. Those costs include the amounts paid to a third party to deliver the finished goods. Any freight costs billed to and paid by a customer are included in revenue.Royalty Income Royalties from non-exclusive, third-party patent licenses are recognized when earned, including monies received at an agreement initiation attributable to past sales. The Company recognizes up-front payments upon receipt when it has no future performance requirement or ongoing obligation arising from its agreements and the payment is for a separate earnings process. Minimum annual royalties received in advance are deferred and are recognized in the period earned. The Company recognized $170 millionof royalty income during 2011.Foreign Currency TranslationThe income statements of foreign entities are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the periods presented. The balance sheets of these entities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and the differences from historical exchange rates are reflected in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss as unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments.Foreign currency risks arise from transactions and balances denominated in non-local currencies. Losses resulting from remeasurement and settlement of such transactions and balances, included in other income expense, net, were $16 million, $09 millionand $19 millionin 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Derivative InstrumentsThe Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Company utilizes a variety of practices to manage these market risks, including where considered appropriate, derivative instruments. The Company uses derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and not for trading or speculation. All derivative instruments the Company uses are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties. As of December31, 2011, the Company had $330 millionof its variable-rate long-term debt fixed under interest rate swap agreements. Usually the contracts extend for no more than 12months, although their contractual term has been as long as 24months. The Company believes the credit risks with respect to the counterparties, and the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged if the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, are not material in view of its understanding of the financial strength of the counterparties.Gains and losses on instruments that hedge firm commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying hedged items. All other hedging gains and losses are included in period income or expense based on the period-end market price of the instrument. See Note 11. Derivatives, for more information56Table of ContentsCash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid, unrestricted investments with remaining maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents, including money market funds with no restrictions on withdrawals.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, and goodwill when events and circumstances warrant a review. Goodwill is also tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter. Goodwill may be evaluated using a qualitative evaluation and/or a two-step test at the reporting unit level. The first step compares the book value of the reporting unit to its fair value. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform the second step. In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill. The difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill. Any impairment loss is measured as the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further discussion of the Company annual impairment test results.The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed each reporting period to determine if events or circumstances have changed which may indicate that the assets may be impaired or the useful life may need to be changed. The Company considers internal and external factors relating to each asset group, including expectation of future profitability, undiscounted cash flows and its plans with respect to the operations. If impairment is indicated, an impairment loss is measured by the amount the net carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.Environmental SpendingEnvironmental spending is capitalized if such spending qualifies as property, plant and equipment, substantially increases the economic value or extends the useful life of an asset. All other such spending is expensed as incurred, including fines and penalties incurred in connection with environmental violations. Environmental spending relating to an existing condition caused by past operations is expensed. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or commitment to a formal plan of action.Capitalized Software CostsThe Company capitalizes certain purchases of software and software development costs in connection with major projects of software development for internal use. These costs are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life not to exceed seven years. Costs associated with business process redesign, end-user training, system start-up and ongoing software maintenance are expensed as incurred. Amortization of capitalized software was $68 million, $53 millionand $47 millionfor the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010and 2009, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized software costs was $496 millionand $442 millionat December 31, 2011and 2010, respectively.Business Tax CreditsBusiness tax credits represent value added tax credits receivable and similar assets, such as Imposto sobre Circulao de Mercadorias e Servios, or ICMS, in Brazil. Business tax credits are generated when value-added taxes, or VAT, are paid on purchases. VAT and similar taxes are collected from customers on certain sales. In some jurisdictions, export sales do not require VAT collection. See Note 8. Other Assets for more information.Income TaxesThe Company uses an asset and liability approach to account for and report income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense benefit is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, the Company considers sources of future taxable income57Table of ContentsIn connection with income tax assessments or unrecognized tax benefits, the Company classifies penalties as provision for income taxes and interest as interest expense in its consolidated statements of income.The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal and several state jurisdictions as well as in many foreign jurisdictions. In France, the Company reorganized its legal entities to maximize utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards. With certain exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, or foreign income tax examinations for years before 2008.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits AccountingThe Company recognizes the estimated compensation cost of employees' pension and other postretirement benefits over their approximate period of service. The Company earnings are impacted by amounts of expense recorded related to these benefits, which primarily consist of U.S. and French pension benefits and U.S. other postretirement benefits, or OPEBs. Each year recorded expenses are estimates based on actuarial calculations of the Company accumulated and projected benefit obligations, or PBOs, for the Company various plans.Suspension of additional benefits for future service is considered a curtailment, and if material, necessitates a remeasurement of plan assets and PBO. As part of a remeasurement, the Company adjusts its discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, such as retirement, turnover and mortality table assumptions, as appropriate.Comprehensive Income LossComprehensive income loss includes net income, as well as items charged and credited directly to stockholders' equity, which are excluded from net income. The Company has presented comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.Components of accumulated other comprehensive income were as follows $ in millions:December 31,20112010Accumulated pension and OPEB liability adjustments, net of income tax of $248 million and $253 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010,  unrealized gain on financial instruments, net of income tax of $06 million and $20 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively0453Accumulated unrealized foreign currency translation  other comprehensive income$245$15Changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss were as follows $ in millions:For the Years Ended December 31,201120102009Pre-taxTaxNet ofTaxPre-taxTaxNet ofTaxPre-taxTaxNet ofTaxPension and OPEB liability  gain loss on financial  foreign currency translation  of ContentsTreasury StockCommon stock purchased for treasury is recorded at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on the weighted-average cost basis.Employee Stock OptionsThe Company calculates stock option expense based on the grant date fair value. Stock options have not been granted since 2005 and are not expected to be utilized by the Company in the future. A summary of the status of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2011and changes during the three years then ended is presented in Note 15, Stockholders' Equity.Restricted StockThe Company restricted stock grants generally vest upon completion of a specified period of time. The fair value of each award is equal to the share price of the Company stock on the date of the grant. This cost is recognized over the vesting period of the respective award. A summary of outstanding restricted stock awards as of December 31, 2011and 2010is included in Note 15. Stockholders' Equity.Restricted Stock Plan Performance Based SharesThe Company Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, for key executives includes an equity-based award component that is provided through its Restricted Stock Plan, or RSP. The objectives under the LTIP are established for multiple years at the beginning of a performance cycle and are intended to focus management on longer-term strategic goals. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors designates participants in the LTIP and RSP and determines the equity-based award opportunity in the form of restricted stock for each performance cycle, which is generally measured on the basis of a two or three-year performance period. Performance is measured on a cumulative basis and a portion of each performance cycle restricted stock award opportunity may be earned annually. The restricted shares are considered issued and outstanding when the number of shares becomes fixed, after the annual performance is determined, and such awards vest at the end of the performance cycle. The Company recognizes compensation expense with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in-capital over the performance period based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, with compensation expense being adjusted cumulatively based on the number of shares expected to be earned according to the level of achievement of performance goals.Fair Value OptionThe Company has elected not to measure its financial instruments or certain commitments at fair value.Recent Accounting PronouncementsEffective December 31, 2011, the Company retrospectively adopted the requirements of ASC 220, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which amends the presentation of comprehensive income. To adopt the guidance, the Company added a new financial statement Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income which immediately follows the Consolidated Statements of Income and presents the information on pension and OPEB liability adjustments, unrealized gain loss on financial instruments and unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments which were previously presented in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity. In December 2011, an update to this guidance deferred the effective date for the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income to some future period. 59Table of ContentsNote 3. Discontinued OperationsDue to ongoing losses, the Company decided in 2009 to close its Malaucne, France finished tipping paper mill. During 2010, the run off operations at our Malaucne, France mill were completed and, therefore operations at the Malaucne mill are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Consequently, results of the Malaucne mill have been removed from each individual line within the statements of income and the operating activities section of the statements of cash flow. In each case a separate line has been added for the net results of the discontinued operation, including previously reported restructuring and impairment amounts. The Malaucne mill filed for liquidation under applicable French law during the fourth quarter of 2011. As part of the liquidation process, a trustee was appointed to administer claims of the mill from the remaining assets of the entity. This appointment resulted in the Company loss of control of the ability to direct the activities of Malaucne; therefore, the accounts of Malaucne have been removed from the consolidated results of the Company as of the liquidation date. The Company no longer has continuing involvement or an ongoing interest in Malaucne. The deconsolidation resulted in a $57 milliongain, presented in the results of discontinued operations, to remove the carrying value of Malaucne assets and liabilities and a $07 milliontax benefit as a result of certain intercompany transaction losses which are deductible for French taxes. Restructuring expense incurred during all periods presented primarily related to additional severances, claims from employees for additional severances and environmental remediation costs.Included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are the following major classes of assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations $ in millions:December 31,20112010Assets of discontinued operations:Current assets$$39Noncurrent deferred income tax benefits80Other assets assets held for sale04Liabilities of discontinued operations:Current liabilities122Summary comparative financial results of discontinued operations were as follows $ in millions:For the Years Ended December 31,201120102009Net sales$$06$208Restructuring and impairment expense1579263Gain on deconsolidation57Income loss from discontinued operations before income taxes3693365Income tax benefit1432125Income loss from discontinued  of ContentsRestructuring liabilities related to discontinued operations were classified within accrued expenses in the December31, 2010consolidated balance sheet.

InventoriesInventories are valued at the lower of cost using the First-In, First-Out, or FIFO, and weighted average methods, or market. The Company inventoriable costs primarily include pulp, chemicals, direct labor, utilities, maintenance, depreciation, finishing supplies and an allocation of mill overhead costs. Machine start-up costs or abnormal machine shut downs are expensed in the period incurred and are not inventoried. The definition of market value, with respect to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. The Company reviews inventories at least quarterly to determine the necessity of write-offs for excess, obsolete or unsalable inventory. The Company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization. These reviews require the Company to assess customer and market demand. The following schedule details inventories by major class $ in millions:December 31,20112010Raw materials$277$317Work in process294238Finished goods360371Supplies and  of ContentsNote 6. Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Interest is capitalized as a component of the cost of construction for large projects. Expenditures for betterments are capitalized whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Property, other than land, is depreciated on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. When property is sold or retired, the cost of the property and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet, and any gain or loss on the transaction is normally included in cost of products sold.Property, plant and equipment and related depreciable lives consisted of the following $ in millions:December 31,20112010Land and  and improvements 20 to 40 years or remaining life of relevant lease15441370Machinery and equipment 5 to 20 years66956808Construction in progress754789Gross Property92569216Less: Accumulated  Plant and Equipment, net$4288$4408Depreciation expense was $353 million, $330 millionand $371 millionfor the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Note 7. Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe Company evaluates goodwill for impairment as least annually during the fourth quarter. The annual tests during the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2009 resulted in no impairment. During the 2010 annual testing, the carrying value of goodwill related to Indonesia and Brazil, both part of the Paper segment, were found to exceed their respective implied fair values using a combination of market multiple and present value valuation methods. Country-specific risks, strengthening foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar and recent and projected operating performance were considered in the Company determination of fair value. As a result, during 2010, the Company recorded impairment losses of $27 millionin the Paper segment. The 2010 impairments are also the cumulative goodwill impairments. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each segment were as follows $ in millions:Reconstituted TobaccoPaperTotalGoodwill as of January 1, 2010, net$63$27$90Foreign currency translation  losses2727Goodwill as of December 31, 20105858Foreign currency translation adjustments0202Goodwill as of December 31, 2011, gross$56$27$83Accumulated impairment losses2727Goodwill as of December 31, 2011, net$56$$5662Table of ContentsThe gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization for amortizable intangible assets consisted of the following $ in millions:December31, 2011December31,  intangiblesReconstituted Tobacco  amortization also includes adjustments for foreign currency translation.Amortization expense of intangible assets was $16 million, $18 millionand $21 millionfor the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Companys customer-related intangibles are amortized to expense using the 150% declining balance methodover a 6-year life. Estimated amortization expense is expected to be $12 millionand $03 millionduring the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively.Note 8. Other AssetsOther assets consisted of the following $ in millions:December 3120112010Capitalized software costs, net of accumulated  tax credits, including VAT and ICMS net of $162 million reserve as of December 31, 201139189Grantor trust assets6462Other  tax credits included $148 millionof Imposto sobre Circulao de Mercadorias e Servios, or ICMS, tax credits as of December 31, 2010. The credits, which are a form of value-added tax in Brazil, are generated from the production and sale of certain non-tobacco related grades of paper sold in Brazil. During 2011, we received a special government action in the state of Rio de Janeiro to enable more rapid utilization of these credits. However, the action included certain limitations on the use of these credits for the paper industry and has a finite life of 48 months. As a result, utilization of the Company credits may be delayed barring other changes outside of the Company control. During 2011, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $162 millionagainst the entire carrying value of its ICMS credits of which $159 millionis presented on the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line titled Valuation Allowance on ICMS Business Tax Credits and $03 millionis presented in Cost of Products Sold. These credits do not expire. The Company is still pursuing other actions to utilize the credits. Charges and credits associated with normal ongoing activity are included in Cost of Products Sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Future material changes as a result of new legislation or a change in our operations will be reported separately. Grantor trust assets consist primarily of cash surrender values in Company-owned life insurance policies held by a trust to be used for the eventual payment of employee deferred compensation. Note 9. Restructuring and Impairment Activities The Company incurred restructuring expenses of $140 million, $107 millionand $239 millionin the years ended December31, 2011, 2010and 2009, respectively, in connection with previously announced restructuring activities.In 2010, the line item Restructuring and Impairment expense included $27 millionof Paper segment goodwill impairment.In the Paper segment, rationalization of excess capacity in the base paper manufacturing footprint included restructuring actions to close the Lee Mills facilities in Lee, Massachusetts beginning in 2008, workforce reductions and shutting down a paper machine in Spotswood, New Jersey in 2009, workforce reductions and a small machine impairment in Quimperle, France in 2009 and a workforce reduction in Brazil in 201063Table of ContentsThe Paper segment restructuring expense was $94 million, $105 millionand $228 millionfor the years ended December31, 2011, 2010and 2009, respectively, of which $58 million, $100 millionand $113 millionwas cash-related. In 2011, the Paper segment expense included $36 millionof non-cash fixed asset impairments, based on management estimates of expected future cash flows, and $53 millionrelated to an early retirement plan offered to 40French employees of PdM as part of the 2009 workforce reduction. The total cost of the plan, which is expected to be approximately $90 million, will be recognized over the remaining required service period of the participants through 2014and paid to participants through their respective normal retirement ages through 2017. In 2010, primarily all Paper segment restructuring expense was related to severances that were recorded over the remaining service periods of the affected employees. In 2009, the Paper segment restructuring and impairment expense included $122 millionfor impairments of paper machines in Spotswood, New Jersey and Quimperle, France and $108 millionof restructuring expense related to severances that were recorded over the remaining service periods of the affected employees.The Reconstituted Tobacco segment restructuring expense was $46 million, $02 millionand $11 millionfor the years ended December31, 2011, 2010and 2009, respectively, of which $13 million, $02 millionand $11 millionwas cash-related. In January 2011, the Company learned of decreased RTL needs of a major customer. As a consequence, management decided to suspend the construction of the RTL facility in the Philippines. In 2011, the Reconstituted Tobacco segment restructuring and impairment expense included $33 millionimpairment of RTL Philippines equipment requiring rework and $13 millionof expense related to severances and related suspension costs. The carrying value of the Philippine RTL facility was $719 millionas of December31, 2011. In 2010 and 2009, the Reconstituted Tobacco segment restructuring expense was related to severances that were recorded over the remaining service periods of the affected employees.Restructuring liabilities were classified within accrued expenses in each of the consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2011and December31, 2010. Changes in the restructuring liabilities, substantially all of which are employee-related, during 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows $ in millions:20112010Balance at beginning of year$100$121Accruals for announced programs71102Cash payments95112Exchange rate impacts0311Balance at end of period$73$10064Table of ContentsNote 10.

The Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties which are customary for facilities of this type and covenants and provisions that, among other things, require the Company to maintain a a Maximum Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio of 300 and b Minimum Interest Coverage of 350. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants at December31, 2011.Under the Credit Agreement, interest rates are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus an applicable margin that varies from 125%to 200%depending on the Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement.The Company will incur commitment fees at an annual rate of 020%to 030%of the applicable margin on the committed amounts not drawn, depending on the Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio. As of December31, 2011, the applicable interest rate on Credit Agreement borrowings was 156%on US Dollar borrowings and 239%on euro borrowings.French Employee Profit SharingAt both December 31, 2011 and 2010, long-term debt other than the Revolving Credit Agreement and Euro Revolver primarily consisted of obligations of the French operations related to government-mandated profit sharing. Each year, representatives of the workers at each of the French businesses can make an election for the profit sharing amounts from the most recent year ended to be invested in a financial institution orwith their respective employer. To the extent that funds are invested with the Company, these amounts bear interest at 380%and 360%at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are generally payable in the fifth year subsequent to the year the profit sharing is accrued.Bank Overdrafts and OtherThe Company also had bank overdraft facilities of $451 millionand $338 million, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which $39 millionand $66 millionwere outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and reported as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet. Interest is incurred on outstanding amounts at market rates and was 115%and 100%, respectively, at December 31, 2011 and 2010. No commitment fees are paid on the unused portion of these facilities.Other debt consists of non-interest bearing French segment debt with deferred capital repayment from governmental and commercial institutions primarily related to environmental capital improvements65Table of ContentsInterest Expense and Rate Swap AgreementsThe Company capitalized $15 millionand $07 millionof interest expense in the years ended December31, 2011and 2010, respectively, due to construction of a RTL facility in the Philippines and the EU LIP facility in Poland.The Company maintains interest rate swap agreements on portions of its long-term debt. As a result, as of December31, 2011, the LIBOR rates on $330 millionof the Companys variable-rate long-term debt were fixed at 21%through March 2012. The impact of the swap agreements on the consolidated financial statements was not material for the years ended December31, 2011and 2010. See Note 11. Derivatives for more information.Principal RepaymentsUnder the Credit Agreement, the Company selects an interest period for each of its borrowings. The Company can repay such borrowings and borrow again at a subsequent date if it chooses to do so, providing it flexibility and efficient use of any excess cash. The Company expects to continue to file notices of continuation related to its borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2011 such that those amounts are not expected to be repaid prior to the May 2016 expiration of the Credit Agreement. Following are the expected maturities for the Company debt obligations as of December 31, 2011 $ in  Value of DebtAt December31, 2011and December31, 2010, the estimated fair values of the Companys current and long-term debt approximated the respective carrying amounts since the interest rates were variable and based on current market indices.Note 11. DerivativesIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk on its variable-rate debt. To manage these risks, the Company utilizes a variety of practices including, where considered appropriate, derivative instruments. The Company has no derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes nor any derivatives with credit risk related contingent features. All derivative instruments used by the Company are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties. The fair values of the Companys derivative instruments are determined using observable inputs and are considered Level 2 assets or liabilities.The Company utilizes currency forward, swap and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to selectively hedge its exposure to foreign currency transaction risk when it is practical and economical to do so. The use of these contracts minimizes transactional exposure to exchange rate changes. Usually, these contracts extend for no more than 12months. We designate certain of our foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. For foreign exchange contracts not designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the contracts fair value are recorded to net income each period.The Company selectively hedges its exposure to interest rate increases on variable-rate, long-term debt when it is practical and economical to do so. The Company utilizes various forms of interest rate hedge agreements, including interest rate swap agreements, typically with contractual terms no longer than 24months. Changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps are recorded to net income each period. See Note 10.

During 2011, the Company increased by $59 millionits valuation allowance in Brazil to fully reserve the Brazil net deferred tax asset balance. The 2011 provision includes a $12 milliondeferred tax benefit related to a France tax rate increase enacted in December 2011 which increased the net deferred tax asset for the French businesses. Tax benefits of foreign legal structure result from net foreign tax deductions from the restructuring of the Company foreign operations in 2003. In conjunction with the Company 2008 reorganization of its legal entity structure, the Company decided that the undistributed earnings of LTRI will be permanently reinvested which resulted in a net deferred income tax charge of $10 millionin 200969Table of ContentsThe Company considers the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested or plans to repatriate such earnings only when tax-effective to do so. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends, loans to the U.S. parent, or otherwise, the Company could be liable for both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation.Deferred income tax assets liabilities were comprised of the following $ in millions:December 31,Current deferred income tax assets attributable  and other employee benefits1919Other accrued liabilities3650Valuation allowances0803Foreign tax  current deferred income tax assets$182$62Noncurrent deferred income tax assets attributable to:Operating loss carryforwards$173$41Tax credit  and other employee benefits141127Accumulated depreciation and   noncurrent deferred income tax assets$118$118Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities attributable to:Accumulated depreciation and  loss  allowance18Postretirement and other employee  noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities$198$289The net noncurrent deferred income tax assets relate to the U.S., Poland and Philippine tax jurisdictions and the net noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities relate to the French, Indonesian and Canadian tax jurisdictions. Net deferred tax assets in Brazil and Spain tax jurisdictions are fully reserved by valuation allowances. Total deferred income tax assets were $1051 millionand $1143 millionat December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Total deferred income tax liabilities were $949 millionand $1252 millionat December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Net operating losses, or NOLs, have been generated due to operating losses incurred in recent periods in Brazil and the Philippines as a result of lower operating earnings together with substantial restructuring expenses incurred in Brazil and France. Also, NOLs have been generated since 2003 by the SMH tax group in France and by SM-Spain since its formation in 1997.As of December 31, 2011 the Company had approximately $1444 millionof operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Under current tax laws, remaining NOLs in France and Brazil carry forward indefinitely, NOLs in the Philippines expire threeyears subsequent to the year generated and NOLs in Spain expire 15years subsequent to the year generated. NOLs of approximately $118 millionwill expire from 2014to 2024if not utilized against taxable income in Spain and $54 millionwill expire in 2014if not utilized against taxable income in the Philippines. The remaining $932 millionand $340 millionof NOLs are related to France and Brazil, respectively, and have no expiration date.The Company deferred tax asset valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards for certain entities. The valuation allowance on deferred tax assets associated with NOLs in Spain totaled $40 millionas of December 31, 2011, fully reserving the related deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance in Brazil totaled $73 millionfully reserving the net deferred tax asset balance. The Company assumptions, 70Table of Contentsjudgments and estimates relative to the valuation of these net deferred tax assets take into account available positive and negative evidence of realizability, including recent financial performance, the ability to realize benefits of restructuring and other recent actions, projections of the amount and category of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Actual future operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future periods could differ from the Company current assumptions, judgments and estimates. Continued or future operating losses in the Philippines could result in recording a valuation allowance in a future period. Tax planning strategies have been implemented in France and the Company believes that deferred tax assets associated with the NOL in France are fully realizable. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets. The Company was granted certain tax incentives in Poland for investment in a special economic zone. These incentives are in the form of credits granted in 2011 that will offset future qualified taxable income. Based on granted incentives, commitments achieved, including maintaining certain employment levels, and qualified investment through December 31, 2011, the Company has recorded an $117 milliondeferred tax asset at December 31, 2011, net of amounts utilized in 2011. In addition to its NOLs and incentive tax credits, the Company has certain U.S. state credits, primarily for investments in fixed assets in those states at December 31, 2011. Estimated various U.S. state credits totaled $10 millionas of December 31, 2011, of which the Company has estimated that none of these credits will be realized prior to their expiration and thus have a valuation allowance of $10 millionat December 31, 2011.At December31, 2011, 2010and 2009, the Company had no significant unrecognized tax benefits related to income taxes. The Companys policy with respect to penalties and interest in connection with income tax assessments or related to unrecognized tax benefits is to classify penalties as provision for income taxes and interest as interest expense in its consolidated income statement. There were no material income tax penalties or interest accrued during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010or 2009.The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal and several state jurisdictions as well as in many foreign jurisdictions. With certain exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, or foreign income tax examinations for years before 2008.Note 14. Postretirement and Other BenefitsNorth American Pension and Postretirement Healthcare and Life Insurance BenefitsThe U.S. operations have defined benefit retirement plans that cover all full-time employees. Retirement benefits are based on either a cash balance benefit formula or a final average pay formula for certain employees who were grandfathered and retained retirement benefits under the terms of the plan prior to its amendment to include a cash balance benefit formula. For employees under the cash balance formula, the Company annually credits to the employee account balance a retirement contribution credit, which is a percentage of the employee earnings based on age and years of vesting service in the plan, and an interest credit, based on the average yield for long term treasury bills. For employees under the final average pay formula, retirement benefits are based on years of service and generally on the average compensation earned in the highest fiveof the last 15years of service. Benefits related to the U.S. defined benefit and pension plan are frozen for all employees. In 2009, the Company settled its remaining liability and terminated its U.S. supplemental employee retirement plan.The U.S. operations also have unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans, or OPEB plans, which cover substantially all of its retirees. Certain employees, who were grandfathered and retained benefits under the terms of the Company plans prior to certain past amendments, receive retiree healthcare coverage at rates subsidized by the Company. For other eligible employees, retiree healthcare coverage access is offered at full cost to the retiree. The postretirement healthcare plans include a limit on the U.S. segment share of costs for current and future retirees. The U.S. segment retiree life insurance plans are noncontributory. The Company Canadian postretirement benefits liability is immaterial and therefore is not included in these disclosures.French Pension BenefitsIn France, employees are covered under a government-administered program. Also, the Company French operations sponsor retirement indemnity plans, which pay a lump sum retirement benefit to all of its permanent employees who retire. In addition, the Company French operations sponsor a supplemental executive pension plan. Plan assets are principally invested in the general asset portfolio of a French insurance company71Table of ContentsU.S. and French Pension and U.S. Other Postretirement Benefit DisclosuresThe U.S. pension and OPEB plans and French pension plans accounted for the majority of the Company total plan assets and total ABO at December 31, 2011for the Company and all of its consolidated subsidiaries.The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension plans in the United States and France and other postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit plans in the United States.

The Company also evaluates the expected average duration of its pension obligations in determining its discount rate.

The target asset allocation varies based on the funded status of the plan in an effort to match the duration of the plan liabilities to investments in long duration fixed income assets over time. The Company investment strategy with respect to its French pension plan assets is to invest plan assets at a low level of risk. The primary goal of the Company pension plans is to maintain the highest probability of assuring future benefit payments to participants while providing growth of capital in real terms. To achieve this goal, the investment philosophy is to protect plan assets from large investment losses, particularly over time, while growing the assets as fast as prudently possible. While there cannot be complete assurance that the objectives will be realized, the Company believes that the likelihood of realizing the objectives are reasonable based upon this investment philosophy. The Company has an investment committee that meets formally on a periodic basis to review the portfolio returns and to determine asset mix targets. The U.S. and French pension plans' asset target allocations by asset category for 2012and actual allocations by asset category at December 31, 2011and 2010were as follows:United StatesFrance2012 Target201120102012 Target20112010Asset CategoryCash and cash  securities*Domestic Large Cap252224251617Domestic Small  income   allocation for equity securities under the French pension plan does not differentiate types of equity securities.

The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 measurements. A financial instrument level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; Level 3 Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

In the Philippines and Canada, the employee pension benefits are not significant and therefore are not included in the above disclosures.Other BenefitsWe sponsor a qualified defined contribution plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the plan, the Company matches a portion of employee contributions. The Company cost under the plan was $18 million, $19 millionand $20 millionfor the years ended December31, 2011, 2010and 2009, respectively. The Company provides U.S. executives, certain other key personnel and its directors the opportunity to participate in deferred compensation plans. Participating employees can elect to defer a portion of their salaries and certain other compensation. Participating directors can elect to defer their meeting fees, as a cash deferral, as well as their quarterly retainer fees, as deferred stock unit credits. The Company liability balance under these deferred compensation plans totaled $81 millionand $72 millionat December31, 2011and 2010, respectively, which were included in the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities. In connection with these plans, the Company has a grantor trust into which it has contributed funds toward its future obligations under the various plans See Note 8, Other Assets. The balance of grantor trust assets totaled $64 millionand $62 millionat December 31, 2011and 2010, respectively, which were included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with French law, certain salaried employees in France may accumulate unused regular vacation and supplemental hours of paid leave that can be credited to an individual Compte Epargne Temps, or CET. The CET account may grow over an individual career and the hours accumulated may be withdrawn upon retirement or under other special circumstances at the individual then current rate of pay. The balance of the Company liability for this program reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in other liabilities was $86 millionand $81 millionat December 31, 2011and 2010, respectively. 77Table of ContentsNote 15.

The number of shares, which may be issued under this RSP, is limited to the lesser of 1,000,000shares or the number of treasury shares held by the Company as of the date of any grant. No single participant may be awarded, in the aggregate, more than 50%of the shares authorized to be issued under the RSP. 78Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2011, 330,060restricted shares had been issued under the RSP of which 179,653shares of issued restricted stock were not yet vested and for which $21 millionin unrecognized compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 18years.

Basic and Diluted Shares ReconciliationDiluted net income per common share is computed based on net income divided by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding. Potential common shares during the respective periods are those related to dilutive stock-based compensation, including long-term share-based incentive compensation, stock options outstanding, and directors accumulated deferred stock compensation which may be received by the directors in the form of stock or cash.

Commitments and ContingenciesLeasesFuture minimum obligations under non-cancelable operating leases having an initial or remaining term in excess of one year as of December 31, 2011 are approximately $1 millionannually over each of the next five years. Rental expense under operating leases was $49 millionduring 2011, $44 millionduring 2010 and $60 millionduring 2009. Other CommitmentsThe Paper segment has minimum purchase agreements for wood pulp and other fibers during 2012 of approximately $21 millionand $9 million, respectively. The Reconstituted Tobacco segment has minimum purchase agreements for wood pulp of approximately $10 millionand for tobacco stems of $2 millionin 2012. The Paper segment PdM mill has a minimum annual commitment for calcium carbonate purchases, a raw material used in the manufacturing of some paper products, which totals approximately $2 millionper year through 2014; PdM future purchases at this mill are expected to be at levels that exceed such minimum levels under the contract. The Company enters into certain other immaterial contracts from time to time for the purchase of certain raw materials. The Company also enters into certain contracts for the purchase of equipment and related costs in connection with its ongoing capital projects. The Company has agreements with an energy cogeneration supplier in France whereby the supplier constructed and operates a cogeneration facility at certain mills and supplies steam that is used in the operation of these mills.The Company is committed to purchasing minimum annual amounts of steam generated by these facilities under the agreements through 2021. These minimum annual commitments total approximately $4 million. The Company current and expected requirements for steam at these facilities are at levels that exceed the minimum levels under the contracts. The Paper segment Brazilian mill, SWM-B, has an agreement for the transmission and distribution of energy that covers 100%of the mill consumption of electrical energy valued at approximately $5 millionannually through 2015. The French mills have contracts for natural gas to be distributed to and consumed at PdM, LTRI and St. Girons. The value of the natural gas and distribution to be provided under these contracts is estimated at approximately $330 millionin 2012. The Company has certain other letters of credit, guarantees and surety bonds outstanding at December 31, 2011, which are not material either individually or in the aggregate. LitigationImposto sobre Circulao de Mercadorias e Servios,or ICMS, a form of value-added tax in Brazil, was assessed to our Brazilian subsidiary, SWM-B, in December of 2000. SWM-B received twoassessments from the tax authorities of the State of Rio de Janeiro for unpaid ICMS taxes from January 1995 through November 2000, collectively the Assessment.The Assessment concerned the accrual and use by SWM-B of ICMS tax credits generated from the production and sale of certain non-tobacco related grades of paper sold domestically that are immune from the tax to offset ICMS taxes otherwise owed on the sale of products that are not immune. Oneof the twoassessments related in part to tax periods that predated our acquisition of Pirahy and is covered in part by an indemnification from the sellers of Pirahy, or Assessment 1 case number 2001001115144-5. The second assessment pertains exclusively to periods that SWM-B owned the Pirahy mill, or Assessment 2 case number 2001001064544-6. While SWM-B is primarily responsible for the full payment of the Assessment in the event of an ultimate unfavorable outcome, SWM-B is not aware of any difficulties that would be encountered in obtaining reimbursement of that portion of any payment resulting from Assessment 1 from the previous owner under the indemnification.SWM-B has contested the Assessment based on Article 150, VI of the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988, which grants immunity from ICMS taxes to papers used in the production of books, newspapers and periodicals, or immune papers, and the raw material inputs used to produce immune papers. 80Table of ContentsBoth assessments are presently on appeal in separate chambers of the Federal Supreme Court. Assessment 1 is before the court on a procedural question which, if decided favorably, would invalidate Assessment 1. If decided against SWM-B, Assessment 1 would then be sent back to the lower court for a decision on the merits. Assessment 2 is before the Federal Supreme Court on the merits and will be finally decided by the action of the chamber of the court hearing the matter, unless there is a prior decision by a chamber of the Federal Supreme Court on Assessment 2 that is in contradiction, in which case the conflict between the rulings of the different chambers will be decided by the Federal Supreme Court sitting as a whole. No docket entry has been made yet regarding argument on either assessment.SWM-B continues to vigorously contest the Assessment and believes that the Assessment will ultimately be resolved in its favor. Based on the foreign currency exchange rate at December31, 2011, the Assessment totaled approximately $44 million, of which approximately $20 millionis covered by the above-discussed indemnification. No liability has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements for the Assessment based on our evaluation of the Assessment under the facts and law as presently understood.French Employee Claims for Additional SeverancesIn connection with the closure of the Malaucne mill, approximately 150previously severed employees have filed claims for additional severances in the respective labor tribunal, alleging a lack of economic justification for closure of the mill or that the Company did not follow the precise legal requirements around identifying and offering other jobs within the SWM worldwide group. The Company intends to defend these claims vigorously; however, based on a preliminary evaluation of these claims, it was considered probable that we would incur additional severances in order to resolve this matter; therefore, in the year ended December 31, 2010, the results of discontinued operations included $28 million, of accrued pre-tax expenses associated with these claims. As a result of the liquidation and deconsolidation of the Malaucne legal entity in December 2011, this contingent liability is not reflected in the Company consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011.Indemnification MattersIn connection with its spin-off from Kimberly-Clark in 1995, the Company undertook to indemnify and hold Kimberly-Clark harmless from claims and liabilities related to the businesses transferred to it that were not identified as excluded liabilities in the related agreements. As of December 31, 2011, there are no claims pending under this indemnification that the Company deems to be material. General MattersThe Company is involved in certain other legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that such litigation and claims will be resolved without a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. 81Table of ContentsEnvironmental MattersThe Company operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental matters. The nature of the Company operations exposes it to the risk of claims with respect to environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. While the Company has incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, it believes that its future cost of compliance with environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, and its exposure to liability for environmental claims and its obligation to participate in the remediation and monitoring of certain hazardous waste disposal sites, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or unknown contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by the Company including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators may give rise to additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. The Company incurs spending necessary to meet legal requirements and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment at its facilities in the United States, France, Poland, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil and Canada. For these purposes, the Company incurred total capital expenditures of $10 millionin 2011, and expects to incur approximately $1 millionin 2012 and less than $1 millionin 2013, of which no material amount is the result of environmental fines or settlements. The foregoing capital expenditures are not expected to reduce the Company ability to invest in other appropriate and necessary capital projects and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Customer MattersBeginning in 2009 and through December 2010, Philip MorrisUSA, a subsidiary of Altria Inc., included in its payments against invoices for banded papers a notice that it disputes the manner in which the Company has calculated costs for banded cigarette papers under a cost-plus based contract for this product. Such action is required under the applicable law to preserve Philip Morris-USAs right to bring a claim to recover the alleged overpayments, which to date Philip Morris-USA has not done. Currently, the disputed portion of the payments made by Philip Morris-USA is approximately $244 million. The Company believes that it has properly calculated the amount it invoiced and has not recorded any provision for loss associated with this unasserted claim. The ultimate resolution of this dispute, if unfavorable to the Company, could have a material effect on the Companys financial statements82Table of ContentsNote 17. Segment InformationEffective during 2011, the Company realigned its management structure to evaluate its business based on product lines in addition to geographies. The realignment resulted in an external reporting segment change to product lines from geographies. The Company two operating product line segments are also the Company reportable segments: Paper and Reconstituted Tobacco. The Paper segment primarily produces Cigarette Papers such as cigarette papers, including LIP papers, plug wrap papers and base tipping papers used to wrap various parts of a cigarette for sale to cigarette manufacturers. The Paper segment also includes commercial and industrial products such as lightweight printing and writing papers, battery separator paper, drinking straw wrap, filter paper and other specialized papers. These non-tobacco industry products are generally sold directly to converters and other end-users or brokers. The Reconstituted Tobacco segment produces reconstituted tobacco leaf, or RTL, and wrapper and binder products for sale to cigarette and cigar manufacturers.Information about Sales, Profit and AssetsThe accounting policies of these segments are the same as those described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Company primarily evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on operating profit. Expense amounts not associated with segments are referred to as unallocated expenses. Certain of the Companys assets are used in the production of both segments products. These shared assets, capital spending and depreciation expense are allocated to a segment based on net sales or cost of products sold. Certain assets are not allocated to either segment for performance measurement purposes and are shown as unallocated in the tables below. Segment assets have not been restated for the year ended December 31, 2010 because the Company did not measure performance based on product line segment assets in 2010 and the information is not readily available.$ in millionsNet SalesFor the Years Ended December    ProfitFor the Years Ended December    AssetsDecember 31,     of ContentsInformation about Geographic AreasLong-lived assets by geographic area, excluding deferred income tax assets and certain other deferred charges, as of year end were as follows $ in millions:Long-Lived Assets20112010United   foreign countries5558For purposes of the geographic disclosure in the following table, net sales are attributed to geographic locations based on the location of the Company direct customers $ in millions:Net Sales201120102009Europe and the former Commonwealth of Independent   including China118211271184Latin America625643552Other foreign  of ContentsNote 18. Major CustomersPhilip Morris-USA, Philip Morris International, or PMI, British American Tobacco, or BAT, and Japan Tobacco Inc. together with their respective affiliates and designated converters, accounted for 54%, 54%and 56%of the Company 2011, 2010and 2009consolidated net sales, respectively. The loss of one or more such customers, or a significant reduction in one or more of these customers' purchases, could have a material adverse effect on the Company results of operations.The Company has an exclusive supply arrangement with Philip Morris-USA for a jointly-developed banded cigarette paper that is used in lower ignition propensity, or LIP, cigarettes. The Company produces banded cigarette paper in sufficient quantities to support Philip Morris-USA commercial sales of LIP cigarettes. Under this agreement, Philip Morris-USA is obligated to purchase 100%of its requirements for banded cigarette papers for a minimum period of 7 years, and the Company is obligated to supply such product for a minimum of 12 years, which began June 1, 2007.Philip Morris-USA, PMI, BAT and Japan Tobacco Inc., together with their respective affiliates and designated converters accounted for 35%and 28%of consolidated trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2011and 2010, respectively.The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations on all of its customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. Substantial portions of the Company consolidated accounts receivable are due from companies in the tobacco industry, which has been and continues to be under substantial pressure from legal, regulatory and tax developments. It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation, regulatory actions and additional taxes may have on the tobacco industry, its financial liquidity or relationships with its suppliers. Nor is it possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted, or to what extent, if any, such legislation or regulations might affect the tobacco products industry in general.Note 19.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of presenting comprehensive income in 2011 due to the adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income. The change in presentation has been applied retrospectively to all periods presented.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting./s/ Deloitte Touche LLPAtlanta, GeorgiaFebruary 24, 201287Table of ContentsItem 1.Business1Item! 1A.Risk Factors9Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments16Item 2.Properties17Item 3.Legal Proceedings18Item! 4.Mine Safety Disclosures18Part II.Item 5. Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2011, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended were effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and instructions for Form 10-K. Last year the Chief Executive Officer submitted a Section 12a CEO Certification to the NYSE and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer submitted the certification required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as Exhibits 311 and 312 to the Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2011.There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, is designed to provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. have been detected. As of December 31, 2011, we had no material weaknesses based on our tests using the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.Management Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework,our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.Item 9B. Other InformationNot applicable88Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders ofSchweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and SubsidiariesAlpharetta, GeorgiaWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A Company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements of Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 and our report dated February 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding a change in presentation of comprehensive income./s/ Deloitte Touche LLPAtlanta, GeorgiaFebruary 24, 201289Table of ContentsPart III.
