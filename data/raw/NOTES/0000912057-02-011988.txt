REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS   
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ArQule,Inc. In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of ArQule,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2000 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA   
1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
ArQule,Inc. is engaged in the discovery, development and production of novel chemical compounds primarily for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries. Our operations are focused on the integration of high throughput automated chemistry, structure-guided rational drug design, computational and predictive models of drug-like compound
characteristics and other proprietary technologies which automate the process of chemical synthesis to produce arrays of novel small organic chemical compounds used to generate and optimize drug
development and product development candidates. We are subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology, medical device and diagnostic industries, included, but not limited to, development by
the Company or our competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, and compliance with government regulations. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements are as follows:  Basis of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ArQule,Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary Camitro Corporation, including Camitro, U.K.
Ltd., which was acquired on January29, 2001 collectively, we, us, our and the Company. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  We consider all highly liquid investments purchased within three months of maturity date to be cash equivalents. We invest our available cash primarily in money
market mutual funds and U.S. government and other investment grade debt securities that have strong credit ratings. As a matter of policy, we determine on a quarterly basis the fair market value of
its investment portfolio. Our securities are recorded on our balance sheet at fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities are included in shareholders equity, net of related tax
effects. If the fair market value of a marketable security declines below its cost basis, and, based upon our consideration of all available evidence, we conclude such decline is other than
temporary, we mark the investment to market through a charge to current earnings. At December31, 2000 and 2001, we have classified these investments as available-for-sale.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  At December31, 2000 and 2001, our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
accrued expenses, debt and interest rate swaps. The carrying amounts of these instruments approximate their fair values.  Intangible Assets  Intangible assets primarily relate to the value of the core technology and goodwill from our acquisition of Camitro Corporation. The cost of the core technology
is being amortized on a straight- 
42  line basis over seven years. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Foreign Currency  Our foreign subsidiary, Camitro, U.K. Ltd., has designated the Great Britain Pound Sterling as its functional currency. Financial statements of this foreign
subsidiary are translated to U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes using current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets and
related elements of expense. Revenue and other expense elements are translated at rates that approximate the rates in effect on the transaction dates. Related cumulative translation adjustments are
included as a component of equity in the consolidated balance sheet.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Assets under capital leases and
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the respective leases by use of the straight-line method. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed
as incurred.  Revenue Recognition  ArQule has entered into various collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Revenue from collaborative agreements includes
non-refundable technology transfer fees, funding of compound development work, the delivery of compounds, payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting the collaborators specified
criteria, and certain milestones and royalties on net product sales. Non-refundable technology transfer fees are recognized as revenue when we have the contractual right to receive such payment,
provided a contractual arrangement exists, the contract price is fixed or determinable, the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations
under the license agreement. When we have performance obligations under the terms of a contract, non-refundable fees are recognized as revenue as we complete our obligations. Where our level of effort
is relatively constant over the performance period, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis. Funding of compound development work is recognized over the term of the applicable contract
using the percentage of completion method using the proportional achievement of deliveries against a compound delivery schedule or the development labor is expended against a total research and
development labor plan as the measure of progress toward completion. Any significant changes in the assumptions underlying our estimates to complete could impact our revenue recognition. Payments
based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting the collaborator specified criteria are recognized as revenue once the collaborator has accepted the delivery of these compounds and collection
is reasonably assured. Revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone.
Revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements
under which the Company has continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met: the milestone payments are
non-refundable; achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement; substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone; and the amount of the milestone
is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions are not met, the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as
revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations. Payments received under these arrangements prior to the completion of the related work are recorded as deferred
revenue. We believe our revenue recognition policies are in full compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB 101. 
43  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue represents the actual costs incurred in connection with performance pursuant to collaborative agreements and the costs incurred to develop and
produce compounds. These costs consist primarily of payroll and payroll-related costs, chemicals, supplies and overhead expenses.  Research and Development Costs  Costs of internal Research development and Research development done pursuant to collaborations are charged to operations as incurred.
Development costs incurred in connection with funded development collaborations are included in cost of revenue. We incurred research and development expenses of $13,774, $17,699 and $46,446 in 1999,
2000 and 2001, respectively, including amounts assigned to acquired in-process technology of $18,000 in 2001. The value assigned to acquired in-process technology was determined by identifying and
valuing those acquired in-process research projects for which atechnological feasibility had not been established at the acquisition date, bthere was no alternative future use, and
cthe fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability. See Note 6 for additional information.  Stock Compensation  Options granted to employees and members of the Board of Directors are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No25 and related interpretations, including FASB Interpretation No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation.
Under APB No25, no compensation expense is
recognized for options granted at fair market value with fixed terms. We have adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation SFAS No123. All stock-based awards granted to nonemployees, including members of the Scientific Advisory Board, are accounted for as prescribed by SFAS No123 and
Emerging Issues Task Force 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.  Inventories  Inventory, consisting only of raw materials used in producing our compound libraries is stated at the lower of cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, or market.  Segment Data  Management uses consolidated financial information in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance. For this reason, we have determined that we
are principally engaged in one industry segment. We operate three facilities in the United States and we have a small research and development facility in Cambridge, UK, as a result of our acquisition
of Camitro Corporation. See Note 15 with respect to significant customers. Substantially all of our revenue since inception has been generated in the United States and substantially all of our long
lived assets are located in the United States.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
44  Reclassifications  Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1999 and 2000 financial statements to conform to the 2001 presentation.  Earnings Loss Per Share  The computations of basic and diluted earnings loss per common share are based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially
dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities include stock options and warrants. Options to purchase of 2,604,493 and 3,397,277 shares of common stock were not included in the 1999 and 2001
computation of diluted net income loss per share, respectively, because inclusion of such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share.  Comprehensive Income Loss  Other comprehensive income loss refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are
included in comprehensive income loss but are excluded from net income loss as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders' equity, net of tax. Our other comprehensive
income loss is composed of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation amounts relating to realized investment gains and losses and investment
impairment charges are reclassified from other comprehensive income as they are included in net income.  Income Taxes  The asset and liability approach is used to account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely
than not to be realized.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No141, Business
Combinations and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting. It also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. SFAS 142 will require that goodwill and
certain intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS 142 is required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after December15, 2001,
with early application permitted in certain circumstances. We will adopt SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 in fiscal 2002. The balance of goodwill is approximately $25,888 at December31, 2001. We do not
expect any impairment of goodwill upon adoption. Goodwill will not be amortized beginning on January1, 2002. Goodwill amortization expenses were $3,967 for the year ended December31,
2001. 
In
June2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No143 SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which is effective
January1, 2003. SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations and retirement costs related to the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. We do not expect that
the adoption of SFAS 143 will have a significant impact on our financial statements. 
In
August2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No144 SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is
effective January1, 
45  2002. SFAS 144 supersedes FASB Statement No 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions relating
to the disposal of long-lived assets. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS 144 will have a significant impact on our financial statements. 
3. RELATED PARTIES 
We have entered into a number of license, research and development agreements the Agreements with corporate collaborators. Two agreements were entered into
with Solvay PharmaceuticalsB.V. Solvay and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Wyeth. Revenue related to these Agreements is included in compound development revenue-related parties. Solvay and
Wyeth are related parties as they each have a representative on our Board of Directors. Subsequent to year end, in agreement with Wyeth, we discontinued our collaboration. 
4. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES 
The following is a summary of the fair market value of available-for-sale marketable securities we held at December31, 2000 and 2001: DECEMBER 31 MATURITY

December31, 2000 and 2001, marketable securities are carried at fair market value. The vast majority of our marketable securities are classified as current at
December31, 2000 and 2001 as the funds are highly liquid and are available to meet working capital needs and to fund current operations. We had approximately $3,672 in long-term marketable
securities at December31, 2001. The gross unrealized gains on marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 were $29 and $78, respectively. 5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

$107 of furniture and fixtures. 
46  Accumulated amortization of these assets totaled $4,495 at December31, 2000. For the years ended December31, 1999 and 2000, amortization expense related to assets held under capital
lease obligations was $889 and $316 respectively. We retired these assets on January 1, 2001. Total depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001
was $7,690, $7,350 and $8,971, respectively. 
6. ACQUISITION OF CAMITRO CORPORATION 
On January29, 2001, we acquired Camitro Corporation, a privately held predictive modeling company based in Menlo Park, California in a transaction
accounted for as a purchase business combination. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, we issued approximately 34 million shares of our common stock and $1,733 in cash in exchange for all
of Camitro outstanding shares and the assumption of all of Camitro outstanding stock options and warrants. The merger transaction was valued at $84,268 based on our share price on the measurement
date for the merger. The results of operations of Camitro, the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in our financial statements from the date of
acquisition. 
The
purchase price was allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimates of fair value at the acquisition date. The
purchase price exceeded the amounts allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed by $29,699. This excess was classified as goodwill, which was being
amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of seven years through December2001. Under SFAS 142, our goodwill will no longer be amortized, but instead testing annually
for impairment. 
The
following table shows the allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of Camitro: BALANCE SHEET CATEGORY

$18,000 of the purchase price represents the estimated fair value of the purchased in-process research and development IPRD that had not yet reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of operations upon the acquisition date. The value assigned to IPRD
technology was comprised of the initial suite of ADMET absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, toxicity models and the upgrade suite of ADME models. The valuation of the IPRD was
determined using the discounted cash flow method. Revenue and expense projections, as well as technology assumptions, were prepared through 2008 based on information provided by Camitro management.
Revenue projections for each in-process development project were identified as follows: 1revenue derived from products relying on core technology, and 2 revenue derived from projects
relying on a new IPRD project. The projected cash flows, adjusted based on probability of success, were discounted 
47  using a 50% rate for core technology and a 60% rate for in-process technology. The fair value of IPRD was determined separately from all other acquired assets using the income approach. Management
is responsible for the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the IPRD. As
we seek to change the nature of the drug discovery process, we will continue to improve the predictive modeling and other aspects of our integrated technology platform. In
March2002, we signed a technology access agreement with Pharmacia Corporation granting Pharmacia non-exclusive access to its proprietary ADMET simulation technology, the foundation of which is
the computational predictive models developed by Camitro. According to the agreement, Pharmacia will have access to ArQule technology for the purposes of generating ADMET predictions about the
nature of Pharmacia compounds. The agreement allows specified access for one year, with an option for renewal. 
The
following unaudited pro forma financial summary is presented as if the operations of ArQule and Camitro were combined as of January1, 2000 and January1, 2001,
respectively. The unaudited pro forma combined results are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have occurred had the acquisition been consummated on those dates, or of the
future operations of the combined entities. The following pro forma financial summary does not include the charge for in process Research and Development of $180million as this is a material
non-recurring charge. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2000

In
July2001, we purchased approximately 18 million preferred shares of a privately owned proteomics company for $5,000. This represented an approximately 8% ownership interest.
We are accounting for this under the cost method as we do not exert significant influence in the Company. This investment is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

9. DEBT 
In March1999, we entered into a term loan agreement with Fleet National Bank Fleet. The terms of this agreement allow for borrowings up to a maximum
of $15,000 based on 80% of qualifying property and equipment purchases, provided that we comply with certain covenants, including the maintenance of specified financial ratios. Borrowings under this
facility are classified as either Tranche A term loans entered into before June30, 1999 or Tranche B term loans entered into between July1, 1999 and June30, 2000.
Principal amounts due are payable in 16 equal quarterly installments beginning on September30, 1999 and September30, 2000 for Tranche A and Tranche B borrowings, respectively.
Interest payments are made monthly in arrears beginning on the first day of the month following commencement of this agreement and accrue at one month LIBOR plus 175%. We entered into an interest
rate swap agreement with Fleet primarily to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our term loan agreement. At December31, 2001, we had two interest rate swaps with notional amounts
of $2,325 and $4,875 respectively. Under these agreements, we will pay Fleet at rates of 794% and 899%, respectively. Settlement accounting is used for these interest rate swaps which expire on
June2003 and June2004, respectively. The impact on our financial position and results of operations from likely changes in interest rates is not material, as our hedging of
transactions is limited to these specific liabilities. In March2001, we amended and extended our term loan agreement with Fleet National Bank to borrow an additional $16,000 in order to
finance our facility and land purchase Tranche C. Principal amounts are payable in 16 equal quarterly installments beginning on April1, 2001. Interest payments are made monthly in arrears
beginning on the first day of the month following commencement of the amended agreement. Interest accrues at the rate of one month LIBOR plus 175%. On December31, 2001, our interest rate on
Tranche C was 368%. As of December31, 2001, we had total outstanding balances of $2,325, $4,875 and $12,000, respectively, on our Tranche A, Tranche B and Tranche C loans. This facility
is collateralized by all of our property and equipment. 
Our
principal amounts due under the term loan agreement are as follows: YEAR ENDING

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  Preferred Stock  We are authorized to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock. As of December31, 2001 and 2000 there were no outstanding shares of preferred
stock. Our Board of Directors will determine the terms of the preferred stock if and when the shares are issued.  Common Stock  Our amended Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 50 million shares of $001 par value common stock. 
On
November15, 2000, we completed a follow-on offering of 3,358,000 shares of common stock at $2250 per share, which included the underwriters' exercise of their over-allotment
of 438,000 shares of common stock on November21, 2000. We realized total net proceeds of approximately $70,691. At
December31, 2001, we have 5,122,423 common shares reserved for purchase of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and for the exercise of common stock options
pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan, the Directors Plan and the options acquired from Camitro Stock Plan.  Stock Restrictions  As part of the exchange of all of Camitro outstanding shares, stock options and warrants on January29, 2001 for ArQule, we acquired Restricted Common
Stock that was still subject to vesting at the time of the merger. This Restricted Stock is subject to stock repurchase agreements whereby we have the right to repurchase any unvested shares in the
event of termination of employment with the company, at which time we will immediately cancel all such forfeited shares. Shares subject to this agreement vest over four year periods. As of
December31, 2001, the number of unvested common shares is 138,169. 
11. STOCK OPTION PLANS 
During 2001, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 1994 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan the Equity Incentive Plan increasing the number of
shares of common stock available for awards under the Equity Incentive Plan to 6,700,000. All shares are awarded at the discretion of our Board of Directors in a variety of stock-based forms including
stock options and restricted stock. Pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan, incentive stock options may not be granted at less than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of the grant,
and the option term may not exceed ten years. For holders of 10% or more of our voting stock, options may not be granted at less than 110% of the fair market value of the common stock at the date of
the grant, and the option term may not exceed five years. Stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with an option shall have an exercise price not less than the exercise price of the related
option. As of December31, 2001, no stock appreciation rights have been issued. In September2001, a sub-plan, known as the 2001 Inland Revenue Approved Sub-Plan was added to the 1994
Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan and was approved by our Board of Directors. This plan grants Approved stock options to the employees of the United Kingdom from the Equity Incentive Plan
available awards pool. During 2001, 60,381 Approved stock options were granted. At December31, 2001, there were 1,571,402 shares available for future grant under the Equity Incentive Plan. 
Subject
to the restrictions above, the Board of Directors is authorized to designate the options, awards, and purchases under the Equity Incentive Plan, the number of shares covered by
each option, award and purchase, and the related terms, exercise dates, prices and methods of payment. 
50  On
January29, 2001, we assumed Camitro Corporation outstanding options under the Camitro Stock Plan. Each Camitro Stock Option assumed by ArQule will continue to have the same
terms and conditions, including vesting schedule, set forth in the Camitro Stock Plan, except for the number of whole shares which have been converted from 1,055,500 to 292,157 based upon the Option
Conversion Factor defined in the Merger Agreement. As of December31, 2001, 262,513 ArQule options were
outstanding from the acquired Camitro Stock Plan. There are no longer any shares available for future grant under this Plan. 
During
2001, the 1996 Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan for non-employee directors had 190,500 shares of common stock available for awards. Under this plan, eligible
directors are automatically granted once a year, at our annual meeting of stockholders, options to purchase 3,500 shares of common stock, which are exercisable on the date of grant. Upon initial
election of an eligible director, options to purchase 7,500 shares of common stock will be granted which will become exercisable in three equal annual installments commencing on the date of our next
annual stockholders' meeting held after the date of grant. All options granted pursuant to the Director Plan have a term of ten years with exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of
grant. Through December31, 2001, options to purchase 151,500 shares of common stock have been granted under this plan of which 139,000 shares are currently exercisable. As of
December31, 2001, 39,000 shares are available for future grant. 
During
2000 and 2001, we issued 25,500 and 10,000 options, respectively, to certain members of our Scientific Advisory Board SAB under the Equity Incentive Plan. In 1999, 18,000 shares
were cancelled. Compensation expense in 2000 and 2001 was $660 and $129, respectively. Also during 2000 and 2001, compensation expenses of $220 and $69 respectively was recorded for employees who
received non-qualified stock options at below fair market value on the date of grant. The remaining employee stock compensation of $112 as of December31, 2001 is being amortized as
compensation expense over the vesting period of the options. 
Compensation
expense for 2001 related to the acquired Camitro stock options that were unvested at the time of acquisition was $6,751. The remaining deferred compensation related to the
stock options of Camitro of $4,397 as of December 31, 2001 is being amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the options and shares. 
We
apply APB No25 and related interpretations in accounting for employee grants under the Equity Incentive Plan. Had compensation cost been determined based on the estimated,
value of options at the grant date consistent with the provisions of SFAS No123, our pro forma net loss, pro forma basic net loss per share and diluted net loss per share would have been as
follows: DECEMBER 31 1999
2000
2001 Pro forma net loss 21,746 3,321 46,848 Pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share 173 024 235 For
the purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated value of each employee and non-employee option grant was calculated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option-pricing models require the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide
a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock-based compensation. The model was calculated using the following weighted-average assumptions: no dividend yield for all years; 75%
volatility for 1999, 95% for 2000 
51  and 2001; risk-free interest rates of 546% in 1999, 60% in 2000 and 424% in 2001; and expected lives of 4 years in 1999, 2000 and 2001 for options granted. Option
activity under the Plans for the three years ended December31, 2001 was as follows: STOCK OPTIONS

1,475,816 930 In 1996, the stockholders adopted the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan. This plan enables eligible employees to exercise
rights to purchase our common stock at 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date the right was granted or the date the right is exercised, whichever is lower. Rights to purchase shares
under the Purchase Plan are granted by the Board of 
52  Directors. The rights are exercisable during a period determined by the Board of Directors; however, in no event will the period be longer than twenty-seven months. The Purchase Plan is available to
substantially all employees, subject to certain limitations. At December31, 2001, 405,261 shares have been purchased pursuant to the Purchase Plan. In May 1999 the Board of Directors approved
an increase from 120,000 shares reserved to 420,000 shares reserved of common stock for purchase under the Purchase Plan. This increase was approved at the May 2000 annual meeting of stockholders. In
May 2001 annual meeting, the shareholders approved an additional 100,000 shares of common stock was reserved under the Purchase Plan. As of December31, 2001, there were 114,739 shares
available for future sale under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 
12. Income Taxes 
The current and deferred tax expenses for the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 are as follows: 1999
2000
2001 Current Federal State 1 2 Foreign U.K. 32 1 34 1999
2000
2001 Deferred Federal 140 State 211 Foreign U.K. 71 Valuation allowance 71 The
following is a reconciliation between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the effective rate for the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 1999
2000
2001 Income tax benefit expense at statutory rate 6,102 1,311 13,949 State tax benefit expense, net of Federal tax benefit expense 1,076 390 1,073 Permanent items 3 6,130 Losses and credits without current tax benefit 7,170 Effect of change in valuation allowance 71 4,070 Credits 1,774 1,456 Other 8 6,312 Tax expense 1 34 53  
The deferred tax consequences of temporary differences in reporting items for financial statement and income tax purposes are recognized, if appropriate. Realization of the future tax
benefits related to the deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors, including our ability to generate taxable income within the net operating loss carryforward period. Management has considered
these factors in reaching its conclusion as to the valuation allowance for financial reporting purposes. The income tax effect of temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets is a result of the following: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 1999
2000
2001 Preoperating costs capitalized for tax purposes 189 164 233 Net operating loss carryforwards 6,671 11,417 20,037 Tax credit carryforwards 3,773 6,790 8,179 Equity based compensation 486 830 3,599 Book depreciation in excess of tax 1,361 411 481 Reserves and accruals 329 138 888 Deferred revenue 6,362 4,523 4,434 Other 18 6 27 19,189 24,279 36,916 Deferred tax liabilities Intangible asset 8,170 Valuation allowance 19,189 24,279 28,746 Net deferred tax assets Of
the $28,746 valuation allowance at December31, 2001, $5,247 relating to deductions for nonqualified stock options will be credited to paid-in capital, if realized. 
As
of December31, 2001, we had federal net operating loss NOL and research development credit carryforwards of approximately $52,714 and $5,016, respectively, which
can be used to offset future federal income tax liabilities and expire at various dates through 2021. As required by Statement of Accounting Standards No109, we evaluated positive and
negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss and research development credit carryforwards. We have
determined that it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets and, as a result, a valuation allowance of approximately $28,746 has been
established at December31, 2001. 
Ownership
changes, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, may have limited the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income.
Subsequent ownership changes could further affect the limitation in future years.

containing an AMAP Chemistry Operating System for Pfizer in Medford, Massachusetts. The facility produces Custom Array libraries exclusively for Pfizer. Pfizer owns all rights in compounds produced at
this facility. In addition, we have trained Pfizer staff to use our AMAP Chemistry Operating System. On December31, 2003, Pfizer will receive a non-exclusive license to the AMAP Chemistry
Operating System. In December2001, we entered into a new seven year agreement with Pfizer which superceded our July1999 agreement. In addition to continuing to provide custom array
libraries for Pfizer, we will also transfer our library design tools on a non-exclusive basis to Pfizer. Pfizer has also committed to perform one lead optimization program with ArQule. We may earn up
to $345,000 over the length of the contract, depending on the achievement of certain delivery milestones. Pfizer has committed to maintain certain cash payments resulting from our prior collaboration
as it relates to the transfer of our AMAP chemistry operation system. As of March1, 2002, we have received $80,549 under these agreements. Pfizer has also agreed to make equity investments
totaling $18,000 depending on the achievement of certain delivery milestones. Pfizer made a $10,000 equity investment in December2001. Pfizer may terminate the new agreement after four years
for any reason. Pfizer will pay no milestones or royalties to us on compounds that they develop and market.  Bayer.  In October1999, we entered into a three-year collaboration with Bayer AG to produce Custom Array libraries. In October2001, we extended the
production period until June30, 2003. Bayer will own all rights in compounds for an initial period, after which we will co-own rights in compounds that Bayer has not claimed in a patent
application. We received a $3,000 upfront payment and will receive up to an additional $27,000 during the term of the agreement for delivery and success fees. As of March1, 2002, we have
received $17,541 under this agreement. Bayer will pay no milestones or royalties to us on compounds that they develop and market. 
55  Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.  In July1997, we entered into a four and one half year agreement with Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Wyeth. Under this agreement, Wyeth subscribed to our
Mapping Array and Directed Array Programs. We discontinued our Mapping Array program as of 2002, and as a consequence and in agreement with Wyeth, we did not renew our collaboration. Wyeth made a
$2,000 equity investment in ArQule in June1998. As of March1, 2002, we have received all $26,134 that we are due under this
agreement. Wyeth has agreed to pay us development milestones and royalties from the sales of products resulting from compounds we shipped during the collaboration. To date, we have not received any
milestone or royalty payments.  Solvay.  In November1995, we entered into a five-year agreement with Solvay Duphar B.V. Under this agreement, Solvay subscribed to our Mapping Array and Directed
Array programs and received a non-exclusive license to our AMAP Chemistry Operating System. This agreement was superseded by an amended and restated agreement with Solvay Pharmaceuticals B.V., which
became effective on January1, 2001. The amended agreement extends the collaboration through December31, 2003. Under the amended agreement, Solvay receives our Compass Array libraries
and continues to access our Mapping Array libraries and Directed Array programs. We discontinued our Mapping Array program as of 2002 as planned. The remainder of the contract was not affected. As of
March1, 2002, we have received $19,877 under these agreements. Solvay has also agreed to make additional payments if we achieve certain development milestones and to pay royalties on sales of
any drugs that result from the relationship. To date, we have not received any milestone or royalty payments. In connection with the original collaboration, signed in November1995, an
affiliate of Solvay, Physica B.V., made a $7,000 equity investment in ArQule.  Pharmacia.  We entered into a five-year collaboration with Monsanto Company now Pharmacia Corporation in December1996. Under this agreement, we provided Monsanto
with access to our Mapping and Directed Array programs for use in the development of agrochemicals. In January2000, we expanded this collaboration to cover life science applications, including
pharmaceutical use by Monsanto G.D. Searle division, and extended the term until December2002. We also agreed to provide Monsanto with Compass Array and Mapping Array libraries through 2001
and Compass Array libraries only through December2002. We also converted the Monsanto agrochemical Directed Array Program into a credit for pharmaceutical lead optimization services. Pharmacia
is committed to make payments totaling $13,000 under this agreement. In addition, Monsanto has agreed to pay us development milestones and royalties from the sales of products resulting from the
collaboration. In July1998, we received a milestone payment for a Mapping Array compound selected by Monsanto for entry into field trials. On June30, 2000, in connection with the
merger between Monsanto and Pharmacia, we replaced our existing collaboration agreement with a new collaboration agreement with G.D. Searle Co., a division of Pharmacia. The financial terms
of the new agreement are substantially the same as the prior agreement. However, we expanded the scope of the agreement to enable Pharmacia and its affiliates to screen our compounds, which may result
in milestone and royalty payments in the future. To date, we have received $12,443 under this agreement. In March2002, we entered into a one year technical access agreement with Pharmacia
which granted them non-exclusive access to our proprietary ADMET simulation technology.  Sankyo.  In November1997, we entered into a three-year agreement with Sankyo Company, Ltd. to discover and optimize drug candidates. Under the terms of the
agreement, Sankyo received a subscription to 
56  our Mapping Array program to discover new lead compounds. Sankyo also committed to a minimum number of Directed Array Programs during the term of the agreement. In April2001, we extended our
agreement with Sankyo through 2004 to include the Compass Array libraries in addition to continuing to use our Directed Array program. The total value of the extended agreement is up to $14,800 in
committed payments. To date, we have received $11,080 under both agreements. Sankyo has also agreed to pay us developmental milestones and royalties resulting from sales of any products resulting from
this collaboration. To date, we have not received any milestone or royalty payments under this agreement.  Johnson Johnson.  In December1998, we entered into a three-year collaboration with R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute, a division of Johnson
Johnson,Inc., in which R.W. Johnson subscribed to our Mapping Array program. We discontinued our Mapping Array program as of 2002, and, as a consequence and in agreement with R.W. Johnson, we
did not renew our collaboration. As of March1,2002, we have received all $8,592 that we are due under this agreement. In addition, R.W. Johnson has agreed to pay us developmental milestones
and royalties from sales of any products resulting from this collaboration. To date, we have not received any milestone or royalty payments.  GlaxoSmithKline.  In November2000, we entered into a five-year collaboration and license agreement with SmithKline Beecham Corporation now GlaxoSmithKline. Under the
terms of the agreement, GlaxoSmithKline receives access to our Compass Array libraries and Mapping Array libraries for screening primarily in the anti-infective field. In addition, we have initiated
the first of potentially two drug discovery programs based on a lead compound discovered in a GlaxoSmithKline compound library. GlaxoSmithKline receives all rights in compounds developed in these drug
discovery programs. As of March1, 2002, we have received $1,194 under this collaboration. GlaxoSmithKline may terminate the agreement before the end of the five-year term. GlaxoSmithKline has
agreed to pay us development milestones and royalties on sales of products resulting from the collaboration. To date, we have not received any milestone or royalty payments.  Abbott Laboratories.  In June1995, we entered into an agreement with Abbott Laboratories. Under this agreement Abbott subscribed to our Mapping Array and Directed Array
programs. This collaboration was extended on two occasions and ended successfully in March1999. Abbott has agreed to pay us developmental milestones and royalties from sales of any products
resulting from this collaboration. We have not received any milestone or royalty payments from Abbott.  Roche Bioscience.  In September1996, we entered into an agreement with Roche Bioscience. Under this agreement, we synthesized Directed Array compounds. Our obligations under
this agreement ended in March1999. Roche Bioscience has agreed to pay us developmental milestones and royalties from sales of any products resulting from this collaboration. In May 1999, we
received a milestone payment from Roche Bioscience for a Directed Array compound that was chosen for Investigational New Drug application, or IND, enabling toxicology studies. 
Biotechnology Collaborations 
In the past, we have entered into a number of collaborations with biotechnology companies, primarily providing them with access to our Mapping Array libraries.
Going forward, we intend to enter 
57  into only a select number of focused biotechnology collaborations with companies that can contribute significant numbers of important targets, generally around a specific target class or therapeutic
area. These collaborations should pool the necessary resources from each company to conduct a drug discovery program aimed at delivering at least one IND candidate per collaboration. 
Genome
Therapeutics Corporation. On October17, 2000, we entered into a collaborative drug discovery agreement with Genome Therapeutics Corporation to discover and develop
anti-infective drug candidates. Under the agreement, we will use our Parallel Track Drug Discovery program to screen and optimize compounds against a significant number of proprietary validated
anti-infective targets which Genome Therapeutics has derived from its PathoGenomeTM Database. We will share equally in all downstream value created by the collaboration, including future milestone,
royalty and upfront payments resulting from the outlicensing of clinical candidates or later stage compounds derived from the collaboration. 
ACADIA
Pharmaceuticals. On December18, 2000, ArQule and ACADIA Pharmaceuticals entered into a drug discovery collaboration. Under the agreement, ACADIA offers its functional
genomics platform and ArQule contributes its Parallel Track Drug Discovery program to discover novel small molecule drug candidates directed at individual G-protein coupled receptor
GPCR targets. We will share intellectual property resulting from the collaboration, and equally contribute to at least one joint drug discovery program. We will share any revenues resulting from the
commercialization of joint drug discovery programs. In addition to these joint drug discovery programs, each of us will receive exclusive rights to certain compounds that we have decided not to
develop in a joint drug discovery program, subject to a royalty payment to the other party. On April7, 1998, we entered into a material transfer and screening agreement with ACADIA. Under this
agreement, we provided to ACADIA access to certain ArQule compound arrays for screening against their target collection. On May 10, 2000, we entered into a compound license agreement with ACADIA.
Under this agreement, we granted to ACADIA an exclusive license to certain of our compounds having activity against certain of their targets, in return for milestone payments and royalties.

Our
research facilities also include approximately 56,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in Medford, Massachusetts, the majority of which is dedicated to the Pfizer
collaboration. We lease these facilities under two lease agreements, one of which expires on July30, 2005 and one of which expires on July30, 2006. We sublease these facilities
pursuant to three sublease agreements. 
58  On
August1, 2001, Cummings Properties, LLC Cummings significantly raised our rent on the lease that expires July30, 2006. We believe this increase to be in excess of
market rates and, as a result, we are disputing the increase. We have accrued the difference between our estimate of market rate rent and amounts due to us under the subleases for the leased space we
do not occupy. While we are currently paying the rental rate proposed by our landlord, we are currently disputing the amount of the rent increase with the landlord. If the amount of rent we must pay
is in excess of our current estimate of market rates, we will need to recognize additional expense. 
On
January16, 2001, we brought a complaint for declaratory relief and damages against Cummings Properties, LLC Cummings arising out of Cummings' attempts to avoid its
contractual obligations under our two Medford, Massachusetts leases entered into between our company and Cummings and Cummings' attempts to increase our lease rates to what we believe is a higher
amount than is due under the lease agreement. We seek recovery of the funds that we have already paid under protest, without waiver of any rights, to Cummings in response to Cummings' threats to
accelerate rental payments and commence eviction proceedings against us. 
In
connection with our acquisition of Camitro Corporation on January29, 2001, we assumed Camitro existing lease for approximately 24,958 square feet of office space in Menlo
Park, California, which will expire on September30, 2002. Prior to expiration, we have the option to renew this lease for a term of 18 months. Our lease payments are $46,282 per month. 
In
January2001, Camitro Corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Camitro UK, Ltd. leased approximately 10,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in Cambridge,
England for 15,416 British Pounds per month approximately $21,891 per month as of March1, 2002. We lease this facility under an agreement which expires in December2005. In
March2001, we executed a two year sublease
