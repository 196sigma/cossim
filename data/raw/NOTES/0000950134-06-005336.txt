58 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board
of Directors and Shareholders of Business Objects S.A.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Business Objects S.A. as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2005. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at a. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Business Objects S.A. at December31,
2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Business Objects S.A.s internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated March10, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.   /s/ERNST YOUNG LLP   San Jose, California   March10, 2006   
59 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board
of Directors and Shareholders of Business Objects S.A.   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, that Business Objects S.A.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission the COSO criteria. Business Objects
S.A.s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
of the companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item9A,
managements assessment of and conclusion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did
not include the internal controls of Medience S.A., SRC
Software, Inc. and Infommersion, Inc., which is included in the
2005 consolidated financial statements of Business Objects S.A.
and constituted approximately less than two percent of total
assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets, as of
December31, 2005 and approximately less than one percent
of revenues, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting of Business Objects S.A. also
did not include an evaluation of the internal control over
financial reporting of Medience S.A., SRC Software, Inc. and
Infommersion, Inc.   
60 Table of Contents   In our opinion, managements assessment that Business
Objects S.A. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, Business Objects S.A. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial

Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Business Objects S.A. as of

statement of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended

dated March10, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.   /s/ERNST YOUNG LLP   San Jose, California   March10, 2006

Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Organization
and Basis of Presentation   Business Objects S.A. the Company or Business
Objects was organized in 1990 as a socit
anonyme under the laws of the Republic of France. Business
Objects develops, markets and supports business intelligence
solutions. The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared by the Company in accordance with United States
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
GAAP for annual financial information and in
accordance with the instructions to
Form10-K.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and majority
controlled subsidiaries. These financial statements reflect, in
the opinion of the Company, all adjustments consisting of
normal recurring items considered necessary for a fair
presentation of the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.   On December11, 2003, the Company acquired Crystal
Decisions, Inc. and its majority stockholder, Seagate Software
Cayman Holdings Corporation SSCH, collectively
Crystal Decisions through a series of statutory
mergers. The acquisition of Crystal Decisions is referred to
herein as the Crystal Decisions Acquisition and is
discussed in Note5.   In 2005, the Company made three acquisitions: SRC Software,
Inc., Medience S.A. and Infommersion Inc. These acquisitions are
discussed in Note5.   Certain comparative period figures have been reclassified to
conform to the current basis of presentation, such as
Restricted Cash, Deferred Revenues and
Restructuring Liability. For the 2004 presentation,
the Company reclassified $70million in restricted cash
from short term to long term, reclassified $63million in
deferred revenues from short term to long term and reclassified
$40million of short term restructuring costs into
other current liabilities. Such reclassifications
had no effect on revenues, income from operations or net income
as previously reported.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
U.S.GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in its financial
statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but
are not limited to, revenue recognition, business combinations,
restructuring accruals, impairment of goodwill and other
intangible assets, contingencies and litigation, allowances for
doubtful accounts and income and other taxes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.   Translation
of Financial Statements of Foreign Entities   The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is
the applicable local currency in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards FAS No52,

Recognition   The Company enters into arrangements for the sale of:
ilicenses of software products and related maintenance
contracts; iibundled license, maintenance and services;
and iiiservices, primarily on a time   
66 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   and material basis. In instances where maintenance is bundled
with a license of software products, such maintenance terms are
typically one year.   For each arrangement, the Company determines whether evidence of
an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed
or determinable and collection is probable. If any of these
criteria is not met, revenue recognition is deferred until such
time as all of the criteria are met. In software arrangements
that include rights to multiple software products
and/or
services, the Company uses the residual method, under which
revenues are allocated to the undelivered elements based on
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value of the
undelivered elements and the residual amount of revenues are
allocated to the delivered elements.   For those contracts that consist solely of licenses and
maintenance, the Company recognizes net license revenues based
upon the residual method after all licensed software product has
been delivered as prescribed by Statement of Position 98-9,
Modification of
SOPNo97-2
with Respect to Certain Transactions. The Company
recognizes maintenance revenues over the term of the maintenance
contract. The maintenance rates for both license agreements with
and without stated renewal rates are based upon the
Companys price list. Vendor-specific objective evidence of
the fair value of maintenance is determined by reference to the
price paid by the Companys customers when maintenance is
sold separately i.e. the prices paid by customers in connection
with renewals. In the absence of vendor-specific objective
evidence for the fair value of maintenance, when this is the
only undelivered element, license revenues are amortized ratably
over the related contractual maintenance term.   Services consist of maintenance, consulting and training. In all
cases, the Company assesses whether the service element of the
arrangement is essential to the functionality of the other
elements of the arrangement. When software services are
considered essential or the arrangement involves customization
or modification of the software, both the net license and
services revenues under the arrangement are recognized under the
percentage of completion method of contract accounting, based on
input measures of labor hours. For those arrangements for which
the Company has concluded that the service element is not
essential to the other elements of the arrangement, the Company
determines whether: ithe services are available from
other vendors; iithe services involve a significant
degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria; and
iiiwhether the Company has sufficient experience in
providing the service to be able to separately account for the
service. When the service qualifies for separate accounting, the
Company uses vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
for the services and the maintenance to account for the
arrangement using the residual method, regardless of any
separate prices stated within the contract for each element.
Revenues allocable to services are recognized as the services
are performed. Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
of consulting and training services is based upon average daily
rates. When the Company provides services only, the contracts
are typically structured on a time and materials basis.   For sales to resellers, value added resellers and system
integrators partners, the Company records revenues
on a sell-in method and does not provide rights of return or
price protection. For sales to distributors that have a right of
return, revenues are recognized as the products are sold to the
distributor, net of reserves to approximate net sell-through.
Some of the factors that are considered in determining the
reserves include historical experience of returns received and
the level of inventory in the distribution channels. The reserve
reduces the revenues and the related accounts receivable. For
sales to original equipment manufacturers OEMs,
revenues are recognized when the OEM reports sales that have
occurred to an end user customer, provided that collection from
the OEM is probable.   Deferred revenues represent amounts under license and services
arrangements for which the earnings process has not been
completed. Deferred revenues primarily relate to maintenance
contracts, which are amortized ratably to revenues over the term
of the maintenance contracts. In addition, deferred revenues
also include amounts relating to term-based licenses as well as
license arrangements where there are unspecified future
deliverables or where specified customer acceptance has not yet
occurred.

Receivable   Accounts receivable are stated at cost, net of allowances for
doubtful accounts, distribution channel and other reserves. The
Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding
receivables and provides allowances for the portion of
receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are
made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding
invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed,
provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age
and geography of the receivable. In determining these
percentages, the Company analyzes its historical collections
experience along with current economic trends. Invoices that are
unpaid at 210days past the invoice date are generally
written off.   Accounts receivable were stated net of allowance for doubtful
accounts, distribution channel and other reserves totaling
$122million and $125million at December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts
balance represented $88million and $80million of
these balances at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   Net
Income per Ordinary Share and ADS   In accordance with FASNo128, Earnings per
Share, basic net income per ordinary share and
American depositary share ADS is computed using
the weighted average number of ordinary shares and ADSs
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per ordinary
share and ADS are computed using the weighted average number of
ordinary shares and ADSs and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive ordinary and ADS equivalent shares consist of stock
options and warrants where the calculated market price is in
excess of the exercise price of these stock awards.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Short-Term
Investments   Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original
maturity dates of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Investments with maturity dates of greater than three months but
less than one year are considered to be short-term investments.
Restricted cash consists of amounts held in deposits that are
required as collateral under letters of credit or acquisition
agreements.   The Company accounts for its investments in accordance with
FASNo115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
FAS115. At December31, 2005 and 2004,
and as described in Note9, short-term investments of
$47million and $38million, respectively, were
comprised solely of assets held in a rabbi trust related to the
deferred compensation plan obligations of the Company. In
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
Issue
No97-14,
Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where
Amounts Earned are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested,
the accounts of a rabbi trust are required to be consolidated
into the Companys financial statements. This asset is held

68 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   funds which are under the control of plan participants, and have
been classified by the Company as trading under FAS115.
FAS115 requires that for trading securities, any
unrealized holding gains or losses on changes in the fair value
of this asset are recorded in earnings and are not included as a
component of other comprehensive income. While the mutual funds
generally have maturity dates of less than three months, the
Company has classified them as short-term investments versus
cash equivalents given the nature of the underlying obligation.   Derivative
Financial Instruments   The Company accounts for derivatives in accordance with
FASNo133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities
FAS133 and related interpretations.
FAS133, as amended, requires companies to recognize all
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the
balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the
fair value of a derivative instrument depends on:
iwhether the derivative has been designated and
qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and iithe
type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments
that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a
company must designate the hedging instrument based upon the
exposure being hedged as either a fair value hedge, cash flow
hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.   Business
Combinations   The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance
with FASNo141, Business
Combinations FAS141, which
requires the purchase method of accounting for business
combinations be followed. In accordance with FAS141, the
Company determines the recognition of intangible assets based on
the following criteria: ithe intangible asset arises
from contractual or other rights; or iithe intangible is
separable or divisible from the acquired entity and capable of
being sold, transferred, licensed, returned or exchanged. In
accordance with FAS141, the Company allocates the purchase
price of its business combinations to the tangible assets,
liabilities and intangible assets acquired, including in-process
research and development IPRD, based on their
estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over those fair
values is recorded as goodwill. In conjunction with certain
business combinations, the Company records restructuring
liabilities of the acquired company in accordance with EITF
Issue
No95-3,
Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a
Purchase Business Combination
EITF95-3. These costs represent liabilities
that are recorded as part of the purchase price allocation.   The Company must make valuation assumptions that require
significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible
assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets
include, but are not limited to future expected cash flows from
customer contracts, customer lists, distribution agreements and
acquired developed technologies, expected costs to develop
IPRD into commercially viable products, estimated cash
flows from projects when completed and discount rates. The
Company estimates fair value based upon assumptions the Company
believes to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain
and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ
from estimates. Other estimates such as restructuring accruals
associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as
additional information becomes available regarding the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed.   Restructuring
Costs   The Company follows the guidance of FASNo146,
Cost Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities FAS146 for
restructuring of the Companys operations. FAS146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair
value only when the liability is incurred. FAS146 affects
the timing and recognition of restructuring costs for exit or
disposal activities initiated after December31, 2002, and
specifies that commitment to a plan to exit an activity or
dispose of long-lived assets is no longer sufficient to record a
one-time charge for most anticipated costs. FAS146
supercedes EITF Issue
No94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.   
69 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   Goodwill is not amortized, but rather it is periodically
assessed for impairment. The allocation of the acquisition cost
to intangible assets and goodwill therefore could have a
significant impact on the Companys future operating
results. The allocation process requires the extensive use of
estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash
flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets. Further,
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to
previously recorded intangible assets, the values of the assets
are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques.
Significant management judgment is required in the forecasting
of future operating results which are used in the preparation of
the projected discounted cash flows and should different
conditions prevail, material write-downs of net intangible
assets could occur. The Company periodically reviews the
estimated remaining useful lives of its acquired intangible
assets. A reduction in its estimate of remaining useful lives,
if any, could result in increased amortization expense in future
periods.   The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting
unit level Reporting Unit at least annually
and more frequently if events merit. The Company performs this
test in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
FAS142. The Company has determined that
it has only one reportable segment and one Reporting Unit.
Accordingly, goodwill is tested for impairment in a two-step
process. First, the Company determines if the carrying amount of
its Reporting Unit exceeds the fair value of the
Reporting Unit, which may initially indicate that goodwill could
be impaired. If the Company determines that such impairment
could have occurred, the Company would compare the implied
fair value of the goodwill as defined by FAS142 to
its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss, if any.   Property
and Equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Office and computer equipment and
software are depreciated using the straight-line method over the
assets estimated useful lives which range from two to four
years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter
of the asset life or the remaining lease term on a straight-line
basis.   In accordance with Statement of Position 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use, the Company capitalizes
certain costs associated with the development of internal use
software. These assets are amortized on a basis consistent with
the nature of the asset.   Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   The Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for
recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances
which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to:
significant decreases in the market price of the asset;
significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal
factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the
amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction
of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses
combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing
losses associated with the use of the asset; or current
expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or
disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful
life.   Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the
asset and its fair value, which is generally determined based on
the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as
specific appraisals in certain instances. An impairment loss is
recognized in the Statement of Income when the carrying amount
is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.   There were no long-lived assets that were considered to be
impaired during 2005, 2004 or 2003.   
70 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   Software
Development Costs   The Company applies FASNo86, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or
Otherwise Marketed FAS86 to
software developed internally, acquired in business acquisitions
or purchased. FAS86 requires companies to capitalize
eligible software development costs upon achievement of
technological feasibility, subject to net realizable value
considerations. Based on the Companys development process,
technological feasibility is generally established upon
completion of a working model. Research and development costs
prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are
expensed as incurred. Because the period between achievement of
technological feasibility and the general release of the
Companys products has been of relatively short duration,
costs qualifying for capitalization were insignificant during
2005, 2004 and 2003. Accordingly, there were no significant
capitalized software development costs at December31, 2005
and 2004.   Concentration
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term
investments and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash
equivalents and its short-term investments with high credit
quality financial institutions. The Company invests its excess
cash primarily in bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper
and money market funds. The Company has established guidelines
relative to credit ratings, diversification and maturities that
seek to maintain safety and liquidity.   The Company sells its products to many companies in various
industries throughout the world, which minimizes the
concentration of credit risk related to the collection of
accounts receivables. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for
potential credit losses. Actual losses have been within
managements expectations. The Company generally does not
require collateral from its customers.   Income
Taxes   The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with
FASNo109, Accounting for Income
Taxes FAS109 and related
interpretations. Determining the consolidated provision for
income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax
assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company,
income taxes are calculated and provided for in each of the tax
jurisdictions in which the Company operates. This involves
estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as
making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax
assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require
an extended period to resolve. Changes in the geographic mix or
estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the
overall effective tax rate.   The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred
tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more
likely than not to be realized. The Company has considered
future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In
the event that the Company determines that it would not be able
to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets, an
adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to net
income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if
the Company later determines that it is more likely than not
that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, then the
previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. The
Companys current valuation allowance relates to deferred
tax assets of an acquired company. If these tax benefits are
realized, the valuation allowance reduction would result in a
decrease to goodwill.   No taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings
that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. If future
events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working
capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that
these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for
withholding taxes may apply, which could materially affect our
future effective tax rate.   The Company calculates its current and deferred tax provision
based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the
actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the
subsequent year. Adjustments based on   
71 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax
returns are filed and the global tax implications are known.   As a matter of course, the Company is audited regularly by
various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in
proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in
the Company owing additional taxes. The Company establishes
reserves when, despite its belief that our tax return positions
are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, the Company
believes certain positions are likely to be challenged by tax
authorities and the Company may not succeed in realizing the tax
benefit. The Company evaluates these reserves each quarter and
adjusts the reserves and the related interest in light of
changing facts and circumstances that affect the probability of
realizing tax benefits, such as the progress of a tax audit or
the expiration of a statute of limitations. The Company believes
its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that the
Company has adequately provided for any known tax contingencies;
however, its future results may include favorable or unfavorable
adjustments to its estimated tax liabilities in the periods that
assessments are resolved or when statutes of limitation expire.   Other
Current Liabilities   Other current liabilities include accruals for sales, use and
value added taxes, accrued rent, accrued professional fees,
deferred compensation under the Companys deferred
compensation plan, payroll deductions from international
employee stock purchase plan participants, current deferred tax
liabilities, forward contract liabilities on various forward
contracts and other accruals, none of which individually account
for more than five percent of total current liabilities.   Contingencies
and Litigation   The Company evaluates contingent liabilities including
threatened or pending litigation in accordance with
FASNo5, Accounting for
Contingencies. The Company assesses the likelihood of
any adverse judgments or outcomes to a potential claim or legal
proceeding, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when
the outcome of the claims or proceedings are probable and
reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of accrued
liabilities required, if any, for these contingencies is made
after the analysis of each matter. Because of uncertainties
related to these matters, the Company bases its estimates on the
information available at the time. As additional information
becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential
liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may
revise its estimates. Any revisions in the estimates of
potential liabilities could have a material impact on the
Companys results of operations and financial position.   Comprehensive
Income   Accumulated other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign
currency translation gains and losses which have been excluded
from net income as well as unrealized gains and losses on the
effective portion of foreign exchange contracts that are
designated and qualified as cash-flow hedges, net of tax. The
Company has reported the components of comprehensive income on
the consolidated statements of shareholders equity, net of
taxes.   Accounting
for Stock-based Compensation   The Company grants stock options to its employees and officers
pursuant to shareholder approved stock option plans and provides
employees the right to purchase its shares pursuant to
shareholder approved employee stock purchase plans. The Company
also grants warrants to purchase shares to its non employee
directors and, since November 2005, Restricted Stock Units
RSUs to its employees, including officers. The
Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under
the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB25 and related
interpretations.   
72 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial

CompensationTransition and
Disclosurean Amendment of FASB Statement
No123 FAS148. FAS148

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

Opinion No28, Interim Financial
Reporting to require prominent disclosure of the
effects of an entitys accounting policy for stock-based
employee compensation in annual and interim financial statements
on reported net income loss and net income loss per share,
as if the fair-value based method had been applied in measuring
stock-based compensation expense. FAS148 also sets forth
the transitional provisions for companies which have elected to
adopt FAS123.   The Company generally grants stock options for a fixed number of
shares to employees with an exercise price equal to at least the
fair market value of the underlying ordinary shares on the date
of grant. The standard vesting schedule used for stock option
grants is a four year vesting calendar, with a one year cliff
vesting and monthly vesting for the remaining 36months.
The standard vesting schedule used for warrants is three years
with ratable vesting. The vesting calendar used for RSUs can
vary depending on each grant. With the exception of the Crystal
Decisions and Infommersion converted options which are
denominated in U.S.dollars, the stock awards granted by
the Company are denominated in euros. The conversion of the
compensation expense amortized to each period fluctuates based
on the currency exchange rate applicable for the period reported.   At December31, 2005, there were four approved compensation
plans under which stock options were outstanding as described in
Note8. The shareholders of the Company had also approved
three employee stock purchase plans under which the issuance of
shares of the Companys stock was approved, and the
Subsidiary Stock Incentive
Sub-Plan
Sub-Plan
under which the granting of RSUs was approved.   For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, through the end of
2004, management estimated the fair value of stock options,
stock purchase plans and warrants using a Black-Scholes
option-pricing valuation model. In the assessment of the
application of the International Financial Reporting Standards
IFRS on Share-Based Payment
IFRS 2, for its international reporting
requirements, and the adoption of a revised FAS123
standard under U.S.GAAP on January1, 2006, the
Company changed to a binomial-lattice option-pricing model to
value its stock options and warrants for all grants issued after
January1, 2005. The binomial-lattice option-pricing model
is an acceptable method under both U.S.GAAP and IFRS 2.   The Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model was developed
for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have
no vesting restrictions, are fully transferable and do not have
employment or trading restrictions. Employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options and as a result, the Company believes that the use of
the binomial-lattice option-pricing model for the valuation of
stock options and warrants provides a more accurate estimate of
the fair value of its stock awards than the Black-Scholes model.   The Company retained the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation
model for the calculation of the fair value of shares under its
2004 International Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2004
IESPP. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the
fair value of shares issued under its French Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESPP because the measurement date is
not established until the end of the purchase period. In
accordance with FASB Technical
BulletinNo97-1,
the Company has valued shares issuable under this plan using the
intrinsic value method at the end of the purchase period.   The Company determines the fair value of RSUs at the grant date
based on the Companys stock price. For the RSUs subject to
performance conditions, the grant date is determined when the
objectives are set.   For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated
stock-based employee compensation expense is amortized on a
straight line basis over the requisite service period associated
with the equity instrument

based compensation expense related to options assumed in

exchanged under the stock option exchange program, actual
forfeitures, and the revised estimate of the tax benefit.   The amortization of stock-based compensation expense included in
reported net income for 2005, 2004 and 2003 represented
amortization of unearned compensation related to istock
options assumed in the Crystal Decisions, SRC and Infommersion
acquisitions which were unvested at the time of the related
acquisitions, and iithe RSU grants not subject to
performance conditions, which were granted to the Companys
chief executive officer in November 2005. Amortization of
stock-based compensation expense was tax-effected at the actual
rates included in the computation of net income, which does not
necessarily equate to the actual tax benefit which will be
received.   Pro forma net income loss includes the tax-effected
stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair-value
based method. The income tax benefit is limited to non qualified
stock-options granted to the US tax group. The calculated tax
benefit for 2005, 2004, and 2003 may not be equal to, and could
vary materially from, the actual tax deduction that the Company
will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the stock options.

Pronouncements   Share-Based Payment.In December 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
FASNo123R, Share-Based Payment, an
Amendment of FASB Statements No123 and 95
FAS123R. This standard replaces the
existing requirements under FAS123 and APB25 and
requires that all forms of share-based payments to employees,
including employee stock options and employee stock purchase
plans, be treated the same as other forms of compensation by
recognizing the related cost in the statements of income.
FAS123R eliminates the ability to account for stock-based
compensation transactions using APB25 and requires instead
that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based
method. FAS123R is effective for the Company for periods
beginning on or after January1, 2006. The transitional
provisions of FAS123R allow companies to select either a
modified-prospective or a modified-retrospective transition
method, either of which effectively dictates in which period the
actual expense will be reported in the statements of income. The
Company will apply the modified-prospective transition method
when it reports for periods on or after January1, 2006,
which will result in the recognition of an expense in the
statement of income in those periods.   Commencing with the three months ending March31, 2006, the
Company will expense in its statement of income the stock-based
compensation for grants made prior to January1, 2006 with
the historical fair values and the straight-line prorated
amortization schedules used for the purpose of the pro forma
footnote disclosure. Upon adoption of FAS123R, the Company
estimates that the expense before tax benefit associated with
grants made prior to January1, 2006 will be approximately
$84million, and will be recognized over an average
remaining vesting period of 27years. The actual expense
reported in the statements of income will be impacted by factors
which may include, but are not limited to: iactual
forfeiture rate, resulting from individuals terminating their
employment with the Company before the end of the applicable
options vesting schedule, being greater than the expected
forfeitures based on turnover assumption; iichanges to
the exchange rate between the U.S.dollar and the euro as
the Companys options were issued in euros other than
those assumed in the Crystal Decisions and Infommersion
acquisitions but the expense will be reflected in
U.S.dollars; and iiiadditional stock-based awards
granted or issued after December31, 2005, including the
grant of RSUs and options subject to performance conditions to
the Companys chief executive officer and to the chairman
of the board.   In March 2005, the SEC released Staff Accounting
BulletinNo107, Share-Based
Payment SAB107, which provides the
SEC staffs position regarding the application of
FAS123R. SAB107 contains interpretive guidance
related to the interaction between FAS123R and certain SEC
rules and regulations, as well as provides the staffs
views regarding the valuation and disclosure of share-based
payment arrangements for public companies.   Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.In
May 2005, the FASB issued FASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections
FAS154. FAS154 replaces APB Opinion
No20, Accounting Changes and
FASNo3, Reporting Accounting Changes in
Interim Financial Statements. FAS154 requires
that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied
retrospectively with all prior period financial statements
presented based on the application of the new accounting
principle. The statement will require the retrospective
application of the impact of the direct effect of changes in
accounting principles unless it is impracticable to determine
either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of
the change. FAS154 carries forward without change the
guidance contained in APB20 for reporting the correction
of an error in previously issued financial statements and
changes in accounting estimates. FAS154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December15, 2005 and requires
prospective application. The Company adopted this standard for
periods beginning on or after January1, 2006 and currently
does not anticipate that it will have a material impact on its
financial statements or disclosures.

Derivative
Financial Instruments   The Company conducts business globally in several currencies and
as such, it exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. The Company uses derivative instruments to
manage certain of these risks in accordance with the objectives
to reduce earnings volatility due to movements in the foreign
currency exchange rates and to manage exposures related to
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The Company
minimizes credit risk by limiting its counterparties to major
financial institutions.   The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to
reduce short-term effects of foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations on certain foreign currency intercompany
obligations. The gains and losses on these foreign exchange
contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on these
certain foreign currency obligations. These gains and losses are
recognized in earnings as they do not qualify for hedge
accounting. During 2005, a number of contracts were settled.
These settlements resulted in the net outflow of
$63million of cash, resulting in the reduction of the
cumulative
mark-to-market
balance of the forward contracts. Certain of these contracts
were swapped forward.   The Company also enters into foreign currency forward and option
contracts to hedge certain foreign currency forecasted
transactions related to certain operating expenses. These
transactions are designated as cash flow hedges and meet the
Companys objective to minimize the impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on expenses over the contract period. In accordance
with FASNo133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities
FAS133, the Company formally documents its
hedge relationships, including the identification of the hedging
instruments and the hedge items, as well as its risk management
objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction.
Hedge effectiveness is measured quarterly. The effective portion
of the derivatives change in fair value   
76 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss
until the underlying hedge transaction is recognized in
earnings. Should some portion of the hedge be determined to be
ineffective, the portion of the unrealized gain or loss is
realized in the statement of income in the period of
determination. At December31, 2005, the three forward and
option contracts outstanding all had maturity dates of
January17, 2006. At December31, 2005, mark to market
net gains of approximately $02million on the revaluation
of these forward and option contracts were recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding
entry to the forward or option contract asset liability.
Realized net gains of $17million on the settlement of
option contracts were recorded in the statement of income during
2005.   At December31, 2005, the Company had assessed that all
forward and option contracts for which hedge accounting was
applicable still met the criteria to be classified as cash flow
hedges.   The Companys derivative financial instruments are

Acquisitions   The Company completed the following acquisitions in 2005   
Acquisition of SRC Software, Inc., a privately-held vendor
specializing in financial planning, budgeting and performance
management software, on August24, 2005. The results of
operations were included in the consolidated financial
statements after the date of the acquisition. The Companys
wholly owned subsidiary Business Objects Americas, acquired all

assumed outstanding stock options through a statutory merger of
an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary with and into SRC.   
Acquisition of Medience S.A., an enterprise information
integration company, on September16, 2005. The results of
operations were included in the consolidated financial
statements after the date of the acquisition. The Company
acquired all the outstanding capital stock.   
Acquisition of Infommersion, Inc., a leading vendor of
interactive visual analytics, on October31, 2005. The
results of operations were included in the consolidated
financial statements after the date of the acquisition. The
Companys wholly owned subsidiary Business Objects

1484     11     281     36     15     1141   Under the terms of definitive agreements, the purchase price for
the acquisitions consisted of cash, the fair value of stock
options assumed, and transaction costs. In addition, an earn-out
payment of $29million will be paid to former Medience
shareholders in two equal installments in September 2006 and
2007, subject to the satisfaction of certain milestones as
described in the purchase agreement. The earn-out payments to be
made under the Medience agreement, if any, will be recorded as
an additional cost of the acquisition at such time as they are
paid.   Deferred compensation, or unearned compensation cost, on assumed
unvested stock options was based on the intrinsic value of the
unvested options as calculated on the acquisition date. The
amortization of non-cash stock-based unearned compensation is
reflected in the applicable operating expense lines on the
statement of income.   A total of $259million included in the purchase price for
the acquisitions was retained in escrow accounts, which amounts
are payable to the applicable entitys former shareholders,
subject to any indemnification claims at the end of the
applicable escrow period. In addition, another $30million
was placed in an employee escrow account representing retention
payments due to former Infommersion executives, and will be
available for release from April 2007 through October 2007. See
Note15 for a summary of the balance of outstanding escrows
payable.   The acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting.

either individually or in the aggregate.   Significant
Prior Year Acquisition   Crystal
Decisions   On December11, 2003, the Company, Crystal Decisions, SSCH
and three wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company merged in
accordance with an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
July18, 2003, as amended August29, 2003 the
Merger Agreement.   Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Crystal Decisions and SSCH
merged with and into wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company
and ceased to exist as separate entities on December11,
2003. The results of Crystal Decisions operations were
included in the consolidated financial statements after that
date. The Crystal Decisions Acquisition was accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting.   The total purchase price of $12billion for the Crystal
Decisions Acquisition consisted of: $3076million in cash
which was paid out of cash on hand; approximately
233million newly issued ordinary shares or ADSs; the fair
value of approximately 63million stock options assumed in
connection with the Crystal Decisions Acquisition entitling
holders to purchase approximately 63million Business
Objects ADSs at a weighted average exercise price of
$1488 after conversion using the stock option exchange ratio
of 04021; and $139million of estimated transaction
costs. The allocation of the purchase price resulted in
$9780million of goodwill. The purchase price under the
Merger Agreement was fixed and there was no contingent
consideration. The Company determined that the purchase price
allocation period was closed at December31, 2004, with the
exception of items related to years subject to tax audit.   
79 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial

$608million to net tangible assets acquired from Crystal
Decisions; $1707million to the fair value of intangible
assets, including $280million of in-process research and
development that was written off during December 2003;
$198million to deferred unearned compensation on unvested
stock options assumed; and $9780million to goodwill. No

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   In accordance with FASNo142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets FAS142,
the Company tests for impairment at least annually at
June30 of each year or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill or
other intangible assets may not be recoverable. These tests are
performed at the reporting unit level using a two step, fair
value based approach. The Company has determined that it has
only one reporting unit. The first step compares the fair value
of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including
goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount, a second step is performed to measure the
amount of impairment loss. The second step allocates the fair
value of the reporting unit to the Companys tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities. This derives an implied fair
value for the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying
amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied
fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized
equal to that excess. The Company completed the annual
impairment tests and concluded that no impairment existed at
June30, 2005. No subsequent events or changes in
circumstances including, but not limited to, an adverse change
in market capitalization, occurred through December31,
2005 that caused the Company to perform an additional impairment
analysis. No indicators of impairment were identified as of
December31, 2005.   The change in the carrying amount of goodwill was as follows in

Medience and Infommersion, resulting in total goodwill of

$156million of valuation allowance and tax liability
accruals, which comprised a component of the Crystal
Decisions purchase price and a component of Acta
Technology, Inc.s which was acquired in
2002purchase price, were no longer required since they no
longer represented specific identifiable liabilities. Therefore,
goodwill was reduced by $156million in 2005. This

Rent expense, net of sublease income, under all operating leases
was $405million, $378million and
$269million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Sublease income totaled $13million, $18million and
$27million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
total future minimum sublease rental income estimated to be
earned under all non-cancelable subleases at December31,
2005 was $06million, $01million, $01million
and $01million for 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009,
respectively.   The Company leases certain facilities under operating leases
that contain free rent periods and or rent escalation clauses.
Rent expense under these leases has been recorded on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. The difference between
amounts paid and rent expense is recorded as accrued rent and is
included in other current liabilities and other long-term
liabilities. The total liability for accrued rent was
$90million and $69million at December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The Companys obligations
under its SanJose, California lease facility are
collateralized by letters of credit totaling $70million.
The letters of credit are renewable and are secured by
restricted cash.   Legal
matters   On October17, 2001, the Company filed a lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against MicroStrategy Incorporated
MicroStrategy for alleged patent infringement. The
lawsuit alleged that MicroStrategys software infringed on
the Companys U.S.Patent No5,555,403. The
Companys complaint requested that MicroStrategy be
enjoined from further infringing the patent and sought monetary
damages. On August29, 2003, the District Court granted
MicroStrategys motion for summary judgment and ruled that
the Companys patent was not literally infringed, that the
Company was estopped from asserting the doctrine of equivalents
and dismissed the case. The Company appealed the District
Courts judgment to the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. On January6, 2005, the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit decided that the District Court incorrectly
concluded that MicroStrategys products did not violate the
Companys patent and determined that the Company was not
precluded from arguing that MicroStrategys products were
equivalent to a claim of the Companys patent. As a result
of the Federal Circuits ruling, the case was remanded to
the District Court for further proceedings. On July26,
2005, the District Court granted MicroStrategys motion for
summary judgment of non-infringement. The Company filed a Notice
of Appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on
August19, 2005. This appeal remains pending and is being
briefed by the parties. The Company cannot reasonably estimate
at this time whether a monetary settlement will be reached or a
favorable judgment will be obtained in this case.   On October30, 2001, MicroStrategy filed an action for
alleged patent infringement in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Virginia against the Company and its
subsidiary, Business Objects Americas. The complaint alleged
that the Companys software infringed MicroStrategys
U.S.Patent Nos. 6,279,033 and 6,260,050. In December 2003,
the Court dismissed MicroStrategys claim of infringement
on U.S.Patent No6,279,033 without prejudice. On
June7, 2004, the District Court advised the parties that
it was of the opinion that summary judgment should be granted in
the Companys favor as to non infringement of   
82 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   MicroStrategys patent No6,260,050 and that the
trial scheduled to begin on June15, 2004 would not occur.
On August6, 2004, the District Court entered a formal
opinion and order formalizing this decision. On
September3, 2004, MicroStrategy filed a Notice of Appeal
with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The District
Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on August3, 2005 and
took the matter under submission. On November17, 2005, the
Court of Appeals affirmed the District Courts ruling that
the Company was not infringing MicroStrategys patent.   In April 2002, MicroStrategy obtained leave to amend its patent
claims against the Company to include claims for
misappropriation of trade secrets, violation of the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act, tortious interference with contractual
relations and conspiracy in violation of the Virginia Code,
seeking injunctive relief and damages. On December30,
2002, the Court granted the Companys motion for summary
judgment and rejected MicroStrategys claims for damages as
to the causes of action for misappropriation of trade secrets,
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and conspiracy in violation of the
Virginia Code. On October28, 2003, the Court granted
judgment as a matter of law in favor of the Company and
dismissed the jury trial on MicroStrategys allegations
that the Company tortiously interfered with certain employment
agreements between MicroStrategy and its former employees. The
Court took MicroStrategys claim for misappropriation of
trade secrets under submission. On August6, 2004, the
Court issued an order rejecting all of MicroStrategys
claims for misappropriation of trade secrets, except for a
finding that a former employee of the Company had
misappropriated two documents. The Court issued a limited
injunction requiring the Company not to possess, use or disclose
the two documents as to which it found misappropriation. The
Court also denied MicroStrategys request for
attorneys fees. On September3, 2004, MicroStrategy
filed a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit appealing each of the rulings. The Court of
Appeals heard oral arguments on August3, 2005 and took the
matter under submission. On November17, 2005, the Court of
Appeals affirmed the District Courts decisions rejecting
MicroStrategys claims except for a claim alleging
interference with a non-solicitation clause in
MicroStrategys employment agreement which has been
remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. On
December1, 2005, MicroStrategy filed a petition with the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for panel rehearing and
rehearing en banc. The Company filed its opposition to
MicroStrategys petition on January12, 2006. On
January25, 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit denied MicroStrategys petition for rehearing and,
as a result, the only claim remaining pertaining to interference
with a non-solicitiation clause in MicroStrategys
employment will be remanded to the District Court for further
proceedings   On December10, 2003, MicroStrategy filed an action for
patent infringement against Crystal Decisions in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware. The Company
became a party to this action when it acquired Crystal
Decisions. The complaint alleged that the Crystal
Decisions software products: Crystal Enterprise, Crystal
Reports, Crystal Analysis and Crystal Applications, infringe
MicroStrategys U.S.Patent Nos. 6,279,033, 6,567,796
and 6,658,432. MicroStrategy has since alleged that
BusinessObjects XI, Crystal Reports XI and OLAP Intelligence XI,
successors of the products initially accused, also infringe the
patents named in the suit. The complaint seeks relief in the
form of an injunction, unspecified damages, an award of treble
damages and attorneys fees. Summary judgment motions were
filed by both parties. A claim construction and summary judgment
hearing was held on November21, 2005 and the District
Court took the matter under submission. On January 23, 2006, the
District Court issued a Memorandum Opinion granting our motion
for summary judgment as to non-infringement of
MicroStrategys U.S. Patent No. 6,279,033 and for summary
judgment as to the invalidity of MicroStrategys U.S.
Patent Nos. 6,567,796 and 6,658,432. As a result,
MicroStrategys claims that we infringed these three
patents have all been dismissed and will not proceed to trial.   We believe that we have meritorious defenses to
MicroStrategys various allegations and claims in each of
the suits and we intend to continue to vigorously to defend the
actions. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of
litigation in general, and the fact that the discovery related
to certain of these suits is ongoing, we cannot assure you that
we will ultimately prevail. Should MicroStrategy ultimately
succeed in the prosecution of its claims, we could be
permanently enjoined from selling some of our products and
deriving related maintenance revenues. In addition, we could be
required to pay substantial monetary damages to MicroStrategy.   
83 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   Litigation such as the suits MicroStrategy has brought against
us can take years to resolve and can be expensive to defend. An
adverse judgment, if entered in favor of any MicroStrategy
claim, could seriously harm our business, results of operations
and financial position and cause our stock price to decline
substantially. In addition, the MicroStrategy litigation, even
if ultimately determined to be without merit, will be time
consuming to defend, divert our managements attention and
resources and could cause product shipment delays or require us
to enter into royalty or license agreements. These royalty or
license agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to
us, if at all, and the prosecution of the MicroStrategy
allegations and claims could significantly harm our business,
financial position and results of operations and cause our stock
price to decline substantially.   In November 1997, Vedatech Corporation Vedatech
commenced an action in the Chancery Division of the High Court
of Justice in the United Kingdom against Crystal Decisions UK
Limited, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Business Objects
Americas. The liability phase of the trial was completed in
March 2002, and Crystal Decisions prevailed on all claims except
for the quantum meruit claim. The High Court ordered the parties
to mediate the amount of that claim and, in August 2002, the
parties came to a mediated settlement. The mediated settlement
was not material to Crystal Decisions operations and
contained no continuing obligations. In September 2002, however,
Crystal Decisions received a notice that Vedatech was seeking to
set aside the settlement. The mediated settlement and related
costs were accrued in the Crystal Decisions consolidated
financial statements.   In April 2003, Crystal Decisions filed an action in the High
Court of Justice seeking a declaration that the mediated
settlement agreement is valid and binding. In connection with
this request for declaratory relief Crystal Decisions paid the
agreed settlement amount into the High Court.   In October 2003, Vedatech and Mani Subramanian filed an action
against Crystal Decisions, Crystal Decisions UK Limited and
Susan J. Wolfe, then Vice President, General Counsel and
Secretary of Crystal Decisions, in the United States District
Court, Northern District of California, SanJose Division,
which alleged that the August 2002 mediated settlement was
induced by fraud and that the defendants engaged in negligent
misrepresentation and unfair competition. The Company became a
party to this action when it acquired Crystal Decisions. In July
2004, the United States District Court, Northern District of
California, SanJose Division granted the defendants
motion to stay any proceedings before such court pending
resolution of the matters currently submitted to the English
High Court.   In October 2003, Crystal Decisions UK Limited, Crystal
Decisions Japan K.K. and Crystal Decisions filed an
application with the High Court claiming the proceedings in the
United States District Court, Northern District of California,
SanJose Division were commenced in breach of an exclusive
jurisdiction clause in the settlement agreement and requesting
injunctive relief to restrain Vedatech from pursuing the United
States District Court proceedings. On August3, 2004, the
High Court granted the anti-suit injunction but provided that
the United States District Court, Northern District of
California, SanJose Division could complete its
determination of any matter that may be pending. Vedatech and
Mr.Subramanian made an application to the High Court for
permission to appeal the orders of August3, 2004, along
with orders which were issued on May19, 2004. On
July7, 2005, the Court of Appeal refused this application
for permission to appeal. At a case management conference on
January11, 2006, the judge dismissed Vedatechs
application for summary judgment and gave directions for the
matter to proceed to trial.   Although the Company believes that Vedatechs basis for
seeking to set aside the mediated settlement and its claims in
the October 2003 complaint is without merit, the outcome cannot
be determined at this time. If the mediated settlement were to
be set aside an ultimate damage award could adversely affect the
Companys financial position, liquidity and results of
operations.   On July15, 2002, Informatica Corporation
Informatica filed an action for alleged patent
infringement in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California against Acta. The Company became
a party to this action when it acquired Acta in August 2002. The
complaint alleged that the Acta software products infringed
Informaticas U.S.Patent Nos. 6,401,670, 6,339,775
and 6,208,990. On July17, 2002, Informatica filed an
amended complaint that alleged that the Acta software products
also infringed U.S.Patent No6,044,374. The   
84 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   complaint seeks relief in the form of an injunction, unspecified
damages, an award of treble damages and attorneys fees.
The parties presented their respective claim construction to the
District Court on September24, 2003 and on August2,
2005, the Court issued its claim construction order. The parties
are currently engaged in discovery and no trial date has been
set. The Company is vigorously defending the action. Should an
unfavorable outcome arise, there can be no assurance that such
outcome would not have a material adverse affect on the
Companys liquidity, financial position or results of
operations.   Although we believe that Informaticas basis for its suit
is meritless, the outcome cannot be determined at this time.
Because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation in general and
that fact that this litigation is ongoing, we cannot assure you
that we will prevail. Should Informatica ultimately succeed in
the prosecution of its claims, we could be permanently enjoined
from selling some of our products and be required to pay damages.   On September29, 2004, Decision Warehouse Consultoria E
Importacao Ltda. filed an action in the Superior Court for the
State of California, County of SantaClara against Business
Objects Americas and Business Objects Do Brasil, Ltda. for
unspecified damages alleging breach of contract, intentional
interference with prospective economic advantage and contract
relationships, misappropriation of trade secrets, promissory
fraud and unlawful business practices. The parties are currently
engaged in discovery. No trial date has been set. We intend
vigorously to defend this action. Should an unfavorable outcome
arise, there can be no assurance such outcome would not have a
material adverse affect on our results of operations, liquidity
or financial position.   On December22, 2004, Business Objects Americas and
Business Objects Do Brasil, Ltda. filed a lawsuit in the
Superior Court for the State of California, County of
SantaClara against Decision Warehouse Consultoria E
Importacao Ltda. The lawsuit alleges violations of Brazilian
copyright law, breach of contract, unfair business practices,
account stated, open book account and for an accounting. Our
complaint requested damages according to proof,
moral damages under Brazilian law and award of sums
found due after accounting. No trial date has been set.   We announced on October21, 2005, that, in a follow-on to a
civil action in which MicroStrategy unsuccessfully sought
damages for its claim that we misappropriated trade secrets, the
Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia
decided not to pursue charges against us or our current or
former officers or directors. We are taking steps to enhance our
internal practices and training programs related to the handling
of potential trade secrets and other competitive information. We
will use an independent expert to monitor these efforts. If
during the next two years, the Office of the U.S. Attorney
concludes that we have not adequately fulfilled our commitments
we could be subject to adverse regulatory action.   The Company is also involved in various other legal proceedings
in the ordinary course of business, none of which is believed to
be material to its financial condition and results of
operations. Where the Company believes a loss is probable and
can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss is accrued in
the consolidated financial statements. Where the outcome of
these matters is not determinable, no provision is made in the
financial statements until the loss, if any, is probable and can
be reasonably estimated or the outcome becomes known. While the
outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we
do not believe that the outcome of any of these claims or any of
the above mentioned legal matters will have a material adverse
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

shares. On October20, 2005, the Company
cancelled 30million treasury shares as authorized by the
Companys shareholders at the annual shareholders
meeting on June14, 2005 pursuant to the tenth resolution
of the Companys shareholders.   Stock
Repurchase Programs   On June14, 2005, the shareholders approved a share
repurchase program under which the Board of Directors is
authorized to purchase shares for a maximum of 10% of the
Companys share capital, at a maximum purchase price of
3000per share excluding costs or its
U.S.dollar equivalent. The maximum amount of funds
dedicated to the share repurchase program cannot exceed
2500million or its U.S.dollar equivalent. The
authorization specified that the total number of treasury shares
shall not exceed 10% of the Companys issued share capital.
This authorization, which superseded the authorization approved
by shareholders on June10, 2004, is valid for
18months and will expire on December14, 2006.   In May 2005, in compliance with the Companys authorized
share repurchase programs and the new regulations of the
European Union and the Autorit des Marches Financier
the AMF, a French securities regulatory
agency, the Company allocated 124,698shares to future

authorized to repurchase a maximum of 50million of the
Companys ordinary shares at a maximum purchase price of
2500per share with the aggregate purchase price not

valid for 18months and expired on November15, 2004.
On May14, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors
approved a share repurchase of up to 35million ordinary
shares at or below 2500per share in accordance with
a share repurchase program authorized by shareholders on
May15, 2003. In May and August 2004, the Company
repurchased an aggregate of 20million of its ordinary
shares under this program. The total U.S.dollar equivalent
purchase price was approximately $210million with the
average share price at purchase of 1751.   Stock
Option Exchange Programs   2002
Stock Option Exchange Program   On October11, 2002, the Company announced a voluntary
stock option exchange program for its eligible employees. This
program included two separate offers: one to eligible France
based employees the 2002 French Offer and the
other to eligible international employees, including employees
in the U.S.the 2002 International Offer.
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of each offer, as amended,
eligible employees were given the opportunity to renounce the
right to the benefit of all outstanding stock options having an
exercise price of 3000per share or higher granted
under the Companys 1999 and 2001 Stock Option Plans, as
amended. In exchange, new stock options were granted on
May22, 2003 equal to the amount obtained by multiplying
the number of shares to which a benefit had been renounced by
the applicable exchange percentage. If an eligible employee
renounced the right to the benefit of any one option, the
employee was required to renounce the right to the benefit of
all stock options granted to the employee during the six-month
plus one day period prior to the commencement of the offer
regardless of the stock options exercise price.   Both offers expired on November19, 2002. In total, the
Company accepted for cancellation stock options to subscribe to
approximately 28million ordinary shares and granted an
aggregate of approximately 10million new stock options.
Pursuant to the 2002 International Offer, the Company accepted
for cancellation stock options to subscribe to approximately
25million ordinary shares and granted approximately
09million new stock options with an exercise price of
1730per share, except for Italian-based employees
who received new stock options with an exercise price of
1932per share in accordance with the terms of the
exchange agreement. Pursuant to the 2002   
86 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   French Offer, the Company accepted for cancellation stock
options to subscribe to 03million ordinary shares and
granted 01million new stock options with an exercise
price of 1839per share. All grants were made either
at or above fair market value of the ordinary shares on the date
of grant.   The new stock options granted under the 2002 International Offer
retained the vesting schedule of the old stock options they
replaced. The new stock options granted under the 2002 French
Offer retained substantially the same vesting schedule as the
old stock options, except that the new stock options did not
become exercisable until one year following the date of grant of
the new stock options, or May22, 2004.   The offers were not available to: ithe Companys
officers who were also members of the Board of Directors;
iiformer employees; and iiiany of the
Companys employees resident in Sweden and Switzerland. In
addition, new stock options were not granted to individuals who
were not employees of the Company as of the grant date of the
new stock options.   Dividend
Rights   The Company is required to maintain a legal reserve equal to 10%
of the aggregate nominal value of its issued share capital. This
legal reserve is funded by the transfer of at least 5% of the
Companys net income per year to such legal reserve, until
such time as the reserve equals10% of the aggregate nominal
value of issued share capital. The legal reserve balance was
$11million and $13million as of December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, and represents a component of
retained earnings in the balance sheet. The legal reserve is
distributable only upon the liquidation of the Company. The
Companys bylaws also provide that distributable profits,
after deduction of any amounts required to be allocated to the
legal reserve, can be allocated to one or more special purpose
reserves or distributed as dividends as may be determined by the
ordinary general meeting of shareholders. The Company currently
does not have any special purpose reserves.   Net income in each year after deduction for legal reserves is
available for distribution to shareholders of the Company as
dividends, subject to the requirements of French law and the
Companys status or bylaws. Dividends may also be
distributed from reserves of the Company, subject to approval by
the shareholders and certain limitations.   Payment of dividends is fixed by the ordinary general meeting of
shareholders at which the annual accounts are approved following
recommendations of the Board of Directors. If net income is
sufficient, the Board of Directors has the authority, subject to
French law and regulation and without the approval of
shareholders, to distribute interim dividends. The Company has
not distributed any dividends since its inception.   Liquidation
Rights   In the event that the Company is liquidated, the assets of the
Company remaining after payment of debts, liquidation expenses
and all remaining obligations will be distributed first to repay
in full the capital of any outstanding shares. The surplus, if
any, will then be distributed pro rata among the shareholders in
proportion to the nominal value of their share holdings and
subject to special rights granted to holders of priority shares,
if any.   Preemptive
Subscription Rights   Under French corporate law, shareholders generally have
preemptive rights to subscribe for additional shares issued by
the Company for cash on a pro rata basis. Shareholders may waive
such preemptive subscription rights at an extraordinary general
meeting of shareholders under certain circumstances. Preemptive
subscription rights, if not previously waived, are transferable
during the subscription period relating to a particular offer of
shares.   Unearned
Compensation   In conjunction with the assumption of unvested stock options
held by former Crystal Decisions optionees, the Company
recorded $198million of unearned compensation as part of
shareholders equity. At December31, 2005   
87 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   this balance had decreased to $29million from
$81million at December31, 2004 as a result of:
icharges of $43million and $67million,
respectively, to the statements of income as stock-based
compensation expense in 2005 and 2004; and iia reduction
of $09million in 2005 and $36million in 2004 to
account for the forfeiture of unvested stock options. On
January1, 2006 upon adoption of FAS123R, the
remaining balance of unearned compensation will be reversed
against additional paid-in capital and no further deferred
compensation will be charged to the statements of income from
this source.   In conjunction with the SRC acquisition, the Company recorded
$08million of deferred compensation to unearned
compensation as part of shareholders equity. At
December31, 2005, $07million of this balance
remained in shareholders equity with $01million
charged to the statement of income as stock-based compensation
expense. The remaining balance of unearned compensation on
adoption of FAS123R will be reversed against unearned
compensation and no further deferred compensation will be
charged to the statements of income from this source.   In conjunction with the Infommersion acquisition, the Company
recorded $06million of deferred compensation to unearned
compensation as part of shareholders equity. At
December31, 2005, $06million of this balance
remained in shareholders equity with less than
$01million charged to the statement of income as
stock-based compensation expense. The remaining balance of
unearned compensation on adoption of FAS123R will be
reversed against unearned compensation and no further deferred
compensation will be charged to the statements of income from
this source.   In conjunction with the grant of 292,744 restricted stock units
RSUs to the Companys chief executive
officer, the Company recorded $105million of deferred
compensation to unearned compensation as part of
shareholders equity. At December31, 2005,
$80million of this balance remained in shareholders
equity with $25million charged to the statement of income
as stock-based compensation expense. The remaining balance of
unearned compensation on adoption of FAS123R will be
reversed against unearned compensation and no further deferred
compensation will be charged to the statements of income from
this source.   Stock
Based Compensation Plans   The Company grants stock options and RSUs and provides employees
the right to purchase its shares pursuant to shareholder
approved stock option and employee stock purchase plans. The
Company also issues share warrants to its non-employee
directors. RSUs were granted in November 2005 to some executive
officers under an employee stock incentive sub-plan.   The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans
under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by
APB25 and related interpretations with the exception of
assumed options in business combinations and restricted stock
awards. All stock options granted and warrants issued had an
exercise price equal to at least the fair market value of the
underlying ordinary shares on the date of grant.

determines the price at which stock options are granted in
accordance with French regulations applicable to companies
listed on the Eurolist by
Euronexttm
and also in accordance with U.S.laws and accounting
standards. The Companys 2001 Plan provides and the 1999
Stock Option Plan the 1999 Plan provided that the
option price set by the Board of Directors may not be less than
the higher of: i100% of the closing price as reported on
the Eurolist by EuronextTM on the last trading day prior to the
date of grant; or ii80% of the average of the opening
price as reported on such market over the twenty trading days
immediately preceding the grant date.   The 2001 Plan is intended to qualify as incentive stock option
plans within the meaning of Section422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Board of Directors
determines the vesting schedule of stock option grants, which
generally vest at a rate of 25%per year subject to a
minimum of one year of continued service with the Company. The

United Kingdom and Ireland, which have a contractual life of
seven years less one day.   In December 1996, the French parliament adopted a law that
requires French companies to pay French social contributions and
certain salary-based taxes of up to 45% for France-based
employees on the difference between the exercise price of a
stock option and the fair market value of the underlying shares
on the exercise date, if the beneficiary disposes of the shares
before a five-year period four years for stock options granted
after May 2000following the grant of the option. For
stock options issued to France-based employees after
January1, 1997, holders of such stock options are not
permitted to sell or dispose of their shares within five years
of the date of grant four years for stock options granted after
May 2000and, therefore, no social charges should be due
on these stock options. Certain stock options previously issued
by Crystal Decisions to France-based employees allow for
exercise within four years of the date of grant, and therefore,
social charges may be due on these stock options should the
employee exercise within four years. No liability had been
assessed to the Company at December31, 2005 or 2004.   2001 Stock Incentive Plan.During February
2001, the shareholders of the Company approved a stock option
plan in the form of an evergreen plan pursuant to
which the Board of Directors was authorized to issue stock
options corresponding to 345million shares, plus an
annual increase to be added on June30 of each year equal
to the lesser of i45million shares; ii5%
of the total shares of the Company on such date; or iiia
lesser amount determined by the Board. During 2003, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized and reserved
approximately 32million additional shares under the 2001
Plan. On December11, 2003, the shareholders approved the
amendment of the terms of the 2001 Plan and authorized the Board
of Directors to increase annually, on one or more occasions, the
number of shares of the Company that may be subscribed for or
purchased upon the exercise of stock options granted pursuant to
the 2001 Plan, within the limit of the lowest of the following
amounts: i65million shares with nominal value of
010 each per share; iithe number of shares
corresponding to 5% of the total number of the Companys
ordinary shares outstanding as of June30; or
iiiany lesser amount as determined by the Board of
Directors.   During 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized
and reserved approximately 14million additional shares
under the 2001 Plan.   In June 2004, the Companys Shareholders amended the 2001
Stock Option Plan to rename it the 2001 Stock Incentive
Plan approved the adoption of the Subsidiary Stock
Incentive
Sub-Plan as
a sub-plan under the Companys 2001 Stock Incentive Plan
the 2001
Sub-Plan.
The 2001
Sub-Plan
provides for the grant of RSUs or performance shares units
collectively the awards. The shareholders approved
that awards granted under this 2001
Sub-Plan
were restricted to a maximum of 25million shares, limited
by the total number of stock awards under the 2001 Plan. On
November22, 2005, the Administrator of the 2001
Sub-Plan
granted 439,115 RSUs under the 2001
Sub-Plan of
which 50,000 vested on December31, 2005. Of the
50,000shares, 20,400shares were withheld by the
trust, which administers grants of RSUs, to cover withholding
taxes. As of December31, 2005, 389,115shares were
outstanding in the trust which was created to hold shares until
awards are vested under the 2001 sub-plan. These shares are
deemed to be issued but not outstanding and are not entitled to
voting rights until such time as the awards vest and are
transferred to the recipient.   1999 Stock Option Plan.During May 1999, the
shareholders of the Company approved the 1999 Plan pursuant to
which the Board of Directors were authorized to issue stock
options corresponding to 2625million shares.   During June 2000, the shareholders approved the reservation of
an additional 45million shares for issuance under the
1999 Plan. In May 2004, the remaining stock options, which were
authorized but unissued under the 1999 Plan, expired.   Business Objects Americas 1999 Stock Option
Plan.During December 2003, the Company assumed
the as-converted outstanding stock options of former Crystal
Decisions optionees which were granted under the Crystal
Decisions 1999 Stock Option Plan. The former Crystal Decisions
1999 Plan now exists as part of Business Objects   
91 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   and is hereafter known as the Business Objects Americas BOSA
1999 Plan. The grant agreements under this plan continue to be
in force with all terms of the previous grant agreements
remaining unchanged. The Company did not assume any authorized
but ungranted stock options under the Crystal Decisions 1999
Plan and may not regrant any stock options from forfeited stock
options.   An aggregate of approximately 63million ordinary shares
were issued to Business Objects Option LLC. As Business Objects
Option LLC is an indirectly, wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, the shares are not deemed to be outstanding and will
not be entitled to voting rights until such time as the option
holders exercise their stock options. From December11,
2003 to December31, 2005, Crystal Decisions
optionees exercised approximately 37million of these
stock options. In August 2005 and in October 2005, the Company
assumed the as-converted 163,872 and 110,752 outstanding stock
options of former SRC and Infommersions optionees. During
the three months ended December31, 2005, 01million
of those stock options were exercised and relinquished by
Business Objects Option LLC. When any of the 63million
ordinary shares are not needed to satisfy obligations under
outstanding stock options, the Company has the right to sell
such shares on the open market or use them for other corporate
purposes.   With the exception of stock options outstanding under the BOSA
1999 Plan and those options assumed from Infommersion, all stock
options granted by the Company are for ordinary shares and are
priced in euros. The assumed BOSA 1999 Plan stock options and
those options assumed from Infommersion are for ADSs, which
until exercise are held by Business Objects Option LLC, with the
exercise price for these stated in U.S.dollars for
Infommersion and Crystal Decisions assumed options, and in euros
for SRC assumed options.   While the Companys 1994 Stock Option Plan expired in 1999,
approximately 07million stock options remained
outstanding as of December31, 2005 and exercisable under
this plan with contractual lives ending between 2006 and July
2009.   Warrants.Warrants to purchase an aggregate of
435,000shares were outstanding as of December31,
2005 at exercise prices ranging from 1704 to
3613per share with a weighted average exercise
price of 2021per share for all outstanding warrants
and a weighted average exercise price of 2313 for
warrants issued in 2005. There were 210,000 warrants vested and
exercisable of the total outstanding at December31, 2005.
Warrants issued in 2005 expire on the earlier of seven years
from the issue date or 90days after the date the director
vacates their position. Warrants issued in 2004, 2003 and 2001
expire on the earlier of five years from the issue date or
90days after the date the director vacates his position.   On June14, 2005, the Companys shareholders approved
the issuance of warrants to two directors to purchase an
aggregate of 90,000shares. On July21, 2005, the
Board of Directors issued these warrants at an exercise price of
2313per share. The warrants vest at a rate of
3333%per year on June1, 2006, 2007 and 2008. All
warrants were outstanding as of December31, 2005.   On June10, 2004, the Companys shareholders approved
the issuance of warrants to eight directors to purchase an
aggregate of 300,000shares. On June15, 2004, the
Board of Directors issued these warrants at an exercise price of
1704per share. The warrants vest at rates of
either: 3333%per year on July1, 2004, June1,
2005 and 2006; 3333%per year on June1, 2005, 2006
and 2007; or 50%per year on July1, 2004 and
June1, 2005, as the case may be. As of December31,
2005, 255,000 warrants were outstanding and 135,000 warrants
were vested and exercisable. On November19, 2004, 45,000
of these unvested warrants were cancelled due to the departure
of one of the directors from the Company.   On December11, 2003, the Companys shareholders
approved the issuance of warrants to a director to purchase
15,000shares. On January27, 2004, the Board of
Directors issued these warrants at an exercise price of
2695per share. The warrants vest at a rate of
3333%per year on June1, 2004, 2005 and 2006. As of
December31, 2005, all warrants were outstanding and 10,000
were vested and exercisable. The director to whom these warrants
were granted resigned from the Companys board in January
2006 and the unvested portion terminated. In February 2006, the
10,000shares subject to the warrants were exercised.   
92 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   On July22, 2003, the Companys Board of Directors
authorized the issuance of warrants to three directors to
purchase an aggregate of 45,000shares at an exercise price
of 1945per share. The warrants for two of the
directors vest at the rate of 3333%per year on
June1, 2004, 2005 and 2006. The warrants for the other
director vest at a rate of 50%per year on June1,
2004 and 2005. As of December31, 2005, all warrants were
outstanding and 35,000 were vested and exercisable.   On June12, 2001, the Companys shareholders approved
the issuance of warrants to three directors to purchase an
aggregate of 45,000shares at an exercise price of
3613per share. The warrants vested at the rate of
3333%per year on June1, 2002, 2003 and 2004. On
February17, 2005, 15,000 of these warrants expired
unexercised due to the departure of one of the directors from
the Company. As of December31, 2005, 30,000 warrants were
outstanding and exercisable.   On February6, 2001, the Companys shareholders
approved the issuance of warrants to a director to purchase
22,500shares at an exercise price of 5797per
share. The warrants vested at the rate of 3333%per year
on May1, 2001, 2002 and 2003. On March31, 2005, all
of the warrants expired unexercised due to the departure of the
director from the Company.   Employee Stock Purchase Plans.The Company has
two International Employee Stock Purchase Plans intended to
qualify under the provisions of Sections421 and 423 of the
U.S.Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These plans
include the 1995 International Employee Stock Purchase Plan
1995 IESPP and the 2004 International Employee
Stock Purchase Plan 2004 IESPP. Under the terms of
these plans, employees may contribute via payroll deductions up
to 10% of their eligible compensation to purchase shares at a
price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value as of
the beginning or end of the six-month offering period. During
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, the Company issued
approximately 206,888, 293,000 and 273,600shares to
employees pursuant to the 1995 IESPP. During 2005, the Company
issued approximately 219,000shares to employees pursuant
to the 2004 IESPP. The Companys shareholders periodically
approve the issuance of additional shares to the total pool. For
the 2004 IESPP, 700,000 additional shares were authorized in
2005 and 956,000shares remained available for issuance
under the plan at December31, 2005. When the 1995 IESPP
expired in June 2005, there were 375,110shares remaining
in the pool for future issuance.   In addition, the Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase
Plan available to the Companys French employees the
French Plan, who are excluded from participating in
the International Employee Stock Purchase Plans. The French plan
is part of the Employee Savings Plan, which is qualified under
the provisions of French tax regulations. All full-time French
employees who have completed at least three months of service
are eligible to contribute up to 25% of their pre-tax earnings
to the French Plan, of which a maximum of 10% of pre-tax
earnings may be used to purchase the Companys shares
during a set six-month period before the end of the offering
period. The Company does not match Employee Savings Plan
contributions. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, the
Company issued approximately 170,888, 82,700 and
114,900shares to employees pursuant to the French Plan.
The Companys shareholders periodically approve the
issuance of additional shares to the total pool; 100,000
additional shares were authorized in 2005. There are
approximately 121,696shares that remained available for
issuance under the French Plan at December31, 2005.   During 2005, 2004 and 2003, 170,888shares,
82,700shares and 114,900shares were purchased under
the French ESPP, respectively, which had intrinsic values of
$886, $414 or $276per share, respectively. During 2005,
2004 and 2003, 484,358shares including a portion of
approximately 175,000shares expected to be subscribed
under the 2004 IESPP at the beginning of May 2006,
293,000shares and 273,600shares were purchased under
the 1995 and the 2004 IESPP, respectively. For pro forma
presentation purposes, the stock-based compensation expense
calculated for the French ESPP, the 1995 IESPP and the 2004
IESPP is amortized over the purchase period and included in the
FAS148 pro forma table presented in Note1.   Restricted Stock Units RSUs.On
November22, 2005, the Companys Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman and Chief Strategy Officer were granted
389,115 and 50,000 RSUs, respectively. RSUs totaling   
93 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   146,371 are subject to the achievement of performance measures
as specified by the Compensation Committee. As the grant date
for the 146,371 performance RSUs had not occured as of
December31, 2005, no stock-based compensation expense was
recorded in 2005. The probability that the performance measures
will be achieved on each vesting date will be estimated for each
reporting period and applied to the number of restricted stock
units expected to vest. The expense will be recognized on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. During 2005, the
Company recorded stock based compensation expense of
$25million related to the 292,744 RSUs not subject to
performance measures. This amount was also included in the
pro-forma stock-based compensation expense disclosed in
Note1. Under FAS123, the fair value of RSUs is equal
to the market price of an ordinary share of the Company at the
grant date, i.e. weighted average fair value of $3594 for the
292,744 RSUs not subject to performance measures.   Pro
forma Effect of Stock-based Compensation   The Company has elected to measure compensation expense for its
compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed
by APB25 and related interpretations. Pro forma
information regarding net income and net income per share is
required by FAS123, as amended by FAS148, and has
been determined as if the Company had accounted for its
stock-based compensation plans under the fair-value based method
of FAS123. See Note1 under the caption
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation. For
purposes of the pro forma disclosure, management estimates fair
value of stock options, warrants and IESPP options using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model or the
binomial-lattice option-pricing valuation model as further
described in Note1.   The weighted average assumptions used and the resulting
estimates of weighted average fair value of stock options
granted under the Companys stock option plans, warrants
and shares under IESPP granted or purchased during the following
years were as follows

The expected life of stock awards is an output of the
binomial-lattice model used in 2005 versus an input for the
Black-Scholes model used previously.

The turnover assumption used in Black-Scholes model has no
impact on the fair value but only on the number of options
expected to vest during the vesting period. The post-vesting
turnover impact in the Black-Scholes model was included in the
weighted average expected term of three years.   
3 
The turnover assumptions used for the 2005 grants was determined
by pool of employees, using 0% for the Directors, 12% for
France, 14% for the executives and 20% for the rest of the world.   Options and warrants.For 2005, the change in
the valuation model had no impact on reported total expenses,
net income or net income per share as stock-based compensation
expense is currently only reported in the financial statement
notes in accordance with APB25. Commencing on
January1, 2006, the unvested portion of the options will
be amortized into the statements of income over the remaining
requisite service period. If the Company had   
94 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   continued to use the Black-Scholes model and the previous
historical input assumptions, the total expense used in the
calculation of pro forma net income loss related to stock
options and warrants granted during 2005 would have been
approximately $05million lower, before the impact of
taxes, than that calculated using the binomial-lattice
option-pricing model used since January1, 2005.

Employer
Sponsored Employee Savings Plans   French corporate law requires the Company to provide for and
contribute to a Legal Profit Sharing Plan the Legal
Plan for substantially all of the employees of its French
entity. Contributions under the Legal Plan are based on a
formula prescribed by French law and are based on the
achievement of certain goals established by the Board of
Directors. In addition, employees of the Companys French
entity may receive contributions from a separate statutory
profit sharing plan sponsored by the Company. Contributions made
under this statutory plan are reduced by contributions required
to be made under the Legal Plan. The Company accrued for
contributions in the aggregate of $52million for 2005,
$63million for 2004 and $58million for 2003.   The Companys U.S.subsidiary has a defined
contribution 401k Plan covering substantially all of its
U.S.employees. Participants may contribute up to 20% of
their annual compensation to the 401k Plan, limited to a
maximum annual amount as set periodically by the
U.S.Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee
contributions at a rate of $050 for each U.S.dollar
contributed up to a maximum of $2,000per year per person,
subject to a three-year vesting schedule. Company matching
contributions to the 401k Plan totaled approximately
$17million in 2005, $13million in 2004 and
$08million in 2003.   The Companys Canadian subsidiary has a registered
retirement savings plan RRSP covering
substantially all of its Canadian employees. Participants may
contribute up to a maximum annual amount as set periodically by
the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency. The Company matches
employee contributions at a rate of Canadian $050 for each
Canadian dollar contributed up to a maximum of Canadian
$2,500per year per person or 6% of their annual salary,
whichever is less. Company matching contributions to the RRSP
totaled approximately Canadian $23million and Canadian
$21million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. No material
matching contributions were made in 2003.   The Companys U.S.subsidiary has a nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan which permits eligible officers and
employees to defer up to a maximum of 85% of their base salary
and up to 100% of their bonuses each year. The Company does not
contribute to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Participants may
elect to receive distributions from the plan at a pre-determined
date or upon termination of employment or retirement, based upon
years of service. The assets are held by the Company in a rabbi
trust, which is subject to the claims of the general creditors
of the Company. The trusts assets, consisting of an
investment in a variable universal life insurance policy backed
by insurance dedicated mutual funds, totaled $47million
and $38million at December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and were classified as short-term investments in
accordance with FAS115. The Deferred Compensation Plan
does not allow participants to invest the deferred compensation
in the Companys ordinary shares or ADSs. The liability
under the Deferred Compensation Plan was approximately
$56million and $45million at December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, and was included in other current
liabilities. Changes to the fair value of the obligation to
reflect the amount owed to the employee are adjusted through a
corresponding charge to compensation expense. Changes to the
fair value of the asset are charged to other income and were not
material in total during any of 2005, 2004 or 2003. The
difference between the asset and the liability amount represents
the unfunded portion of the liability.   Pension
Plans and Termination Indemnities   The Company has one pension plan the French Pension
Plan which is accounted for in accordance with
FASNo87, Employers Accounting for
Pensions FAS87. The French Pension
Plan is managed by a third party financial institution and aside
from the net liability due to fund the benefit obligation, the
asset and total benefit obligation are not included on the
Companys consolidated balance sheet. In December 2003, the
FASB   
95 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   issued FASNo132 Revised, Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefitan amendment of FASB Statements
No87, 88 and 106 FAS132R.
FAS132R did not change the measurement or recognition
provisions for pensions and other postretirement benefits set
forth under FAS132, but instead expanded employers
disclosure requirements for pension and postretirement benefits
to enhance information about plan assets, obligations, benefit
payments, contributions and net benefit cost. The Company has
determined that the pension plan meets the scope of
FAS132R; however, it is not material to the Companys
financial position or operating results and thus limited
disclosures of the pension plan are described below.   French
Pension Plan   French law requires the Company to provide for the payment of a
lump sum retirement indemnity to French employees based upon
years of service and compensation at retirement under the French
Pension Plan. Benefits do not vest prior to retirement. The
Companys benefit obligation was approximately
$14million, $12million, $10million as of
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
increase in the balance is the result of increases to the
obligation for service and interest cost, adjusted by the
actuarial valuation and overall impact by the translation of
this eurodenominated obligation to
U.S.dollars. The benefit obligation is calculated as the
present value of estimated future benefits to be paid, using the
following assumptions: aRetirement age: 65years;
bDiscount rate: 40%; cRate of compensation
increase: see table below; and dturnover rate: see table

Pension Plan during the year, with employer contributions of
$02million in 2005, $01million in 2004 and
$06million in 2003 charged to the statement of income.   The French Pension Plan assets are held in debt and equity
instruments and for 2005 represented approximately 80% of the
total benefit obligation due to the timing of employer
contributions. Under the arrangement with the third party,
payments of indemnity amounts in the future are paid to
employees directly by the Company, as funded by the third party
financial institution.   Italian
Indemnity   The Company provides for a termination indemnity for Italian
employees whereby a specified amount, as required by Italian
law, is accrued as a liability for future payment to employees
on termination of employment with a corresponding charge to
compensation expense in the period of accrual. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, the balance of
approximately $21million and $22million was
recorded as other current liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet. The Company made employer contributions of
$06million, $07million and $06million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

27million and 19million stock options were
exercised, respectively, of which approximately
13million, 20million and 06million
represented exercises of options held by Business Objects Option
LLC. At December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
139million, 139million and 163million stock
options, RSUs and share warrants were outstanding in aggregate.   For 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, 46million,
66million and 47million weighted average
outstanding options and warrants to purchase ordinary shares or
ADSs were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income
per share because the option or warrant exercise prices of those
options and warrants during the respective periods was greater
than the average market price of the ordinary shares or ADSs and
therefore, the effect would have been anti-dilutive. These
options could be dilutive in future periods.   In December 2003, the Company issued approximately
233million ordinary shares as partial consideration for
the Crystal Decisions acquisition. In addition, during December
2003, the Company assumed stock options to acquire approximately
63million of ordinary shares or ADSs on the exercise of
stock options by former Crystal Decisions optionees.

14,304     4,220        14,334   During May 2002, the Company entered into an agreement in
settlement of its patent infringement lawsuit against Cognos,
Inc. and Cognos Corporation collectively Cognos.
Under the terms of the agreement, Cognos licensed the rights to
the Companys technology under U.S.Patent
No5,555,403 in exchange for payments totaling
$240million. The license covers both past and future use
of the Companys technology. A $100million first
installment representing past use was received during June 2002
and was classified as interest and other income, net on the
consolidated statements of income for the quarter ended
June30, 2002, net of $31million of related legal
expense. The remaining balance representing future use was paid
in eight quarterly installments of $175million commencing
in the quarter ended September30, 2002. The Company
recognized $35million in 2004 and $70million in
2003 of other income related to this settlement. There are no
further payments required or expected.   The Company operates largely in the U.S., Europe and Canada and
during the course of 2005, the currency exchange rates between
the U.S.dollar, the euro, and the Canadian dollar
fluctuated significantly. The Company is generally naturally
hedged at an operating income level as levels of foreign
currency revenues and expenses are for the most part similar
with the exception of its Canadian subsidiary. During 2005, the
majority of the net exchange gains were the result of currency
purchases to settle quarterly intercompany accounts in euro and
Canadian dollars. The weakening of the euro compared to the U.S.
dollar early in 2005 allowed for significant gains on the
purchase of euro to settle intercompany accounts between the
U.S. and Irish entities. Significant gains were also realized on
the purchase of Canadian dollars by the U.S. and Irish entities.
In 2005, the Company employed an option hedging strategy to
hedge the quarterly forecasted intercompany flows between these
entities. Favorable option contracts in place resulted in gains
despite the strengthening Canadian dollar in 2005. This strategy
permits the Company to mitigate its exposure to the Canadian
dollar by protecting against the strengthening Canadian dollar
while providing opportunity for participation should it weaken.
Since April 2004, the Company has also used forward contracts to
mitigate the impact on the statement of income by matching the
mark to market adjustments on the forward contracts to the gain
on revaluation of intercompany loans.

At December31, 2005, balance sheet classification
included: $136million in current deferred tax assets,
$171million in long-term deferred tax assets, offset by
$29million of long-term deferred tax liabilities. At
December31, 2004, balance sheet classification included:
$83million in current deferred tax assets,
$21million in long-term deferred tax assets and offset by
$76million of long-term deferred tax liabilities.   The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by
$355million in 2005 and decreased by $04million,
as revised, in 2004. The reported valuation allowance for 2004
has been decreased by $112million, deferred tax assets
decreased by $96million and deferred tax liabilities
increased by $16million, from previously disclosed
amounts to reflect adjustments to deferred items assumed in
connection with the acquisition of Crystal Decisions. The
Companys valuation allowance at December31, 2005
reflected the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may
not be realized due to Section382 limitation on acquired
net operating losses. The increase in net deferred tax assets
during 2005 of $249million was primarily due to a
$355million release of a valuation allowance of
$226million to equity and $129million to goodwill.
There was no valuation allowance release to continuing
operations that created a tax rate benefit during 2005 and 2004.   The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
those temporary differences become deductible. As of
December31, 2005, based on historical taxable income and
projections for future taxable income over the periods that the
deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes it is
more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits
of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance
on acquired net operating losses, subject to limitations.   At December31, 2005, the Company had U.S.federal and
state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$861million and $159million, respectively. These
net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various times
from 2018 through 2024 if not utilized. The Companys
future ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards
of Acta and Infommersion, which approximated $642million
and $34million, respectively, of   
100 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   the federal total, is subject to limitation under the
Section382 change of ownership rules of the
U.S.Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As of
December31, 2005, the Company had alternative minimum tax
credit carry forwards of $22million, that do not expire,
generated from the Companys 2003 U.S. federal tax return
filing.   As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by
various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in
proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in
the Company owing additional taxes. The Company establishes
reserves when, despite the Companys belief that its tax
return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax
law, the Company believes certain positions are likely to be
challenged and that it may not succeed in realizing the tax
benefit. The Company evaluates these reserves each quarter and
adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of
changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of
realizing tax benefits, such as the progress of a tax audit or
the expiration of a statute of limitations. The Company believes
its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has
adequately provided for any known tax contingencies.   At December31, 2005, the Company had not recognized a
deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings for certain
foreign subsidiaries, because these earnings are intended to be
permanently reinvested. If such earnings were distributed, some
countries may impose withholding taxes. It is not practicable to
determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income
tax liability.

Business
Restructuring Charges   Crystal
Decisions, Inc.   In December 2003, prior to the Crystal Decisions acquisition,
management began to assess and formulate a plan to restructure
the combined operations to eliminate duplicative activities,
focus on strategic products and reduce the Companys cost
structure. The Board of Directors and management approved and
committed the Company to the plan shortly after the completion
of the Crystal Decisions acquisition.

approximately $22million of charges related to costs
incurred in connection with exiting eight facilities, of which
$08million was paid in 2004 and $10million was
paid in 2005. The remaining liability balance at

the Company reduced the number of planned employee terminations
by approximately 34 employees, which   
103 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial

the restructuring liability and goodwill balances. At
December31, 2005, the remaining liability balance of less
than $01million related to legal costs associated with
employee terminations.   The restructuring charge to abandon facilities of
$27million at December31, 2003 related to estimated
costs for future minimum lease payments associated with the
planned closure of 11 facilities, net of estimated sublease
income to be earned on these premises. At December31,
2005, the remaining liability related to two facilities the
Company is subletting with lease terms extending through 2008.
The decrease in the liability of $02million during 2005
primarily resulted from the payment of minimum lease payments of
$03million which was offset by an increase of
$02million resulting from the adjustment of various
rents, the result of which was included in general and
administrative expenses. At December31, 2005, the
remaining liability balance of $06million is expected to
be paid over the remaining lease terms.   The balances of accrued restructuring charges capitalized as a

All amounts are subject to indemnification obligations and are

includes an additional $30million related to an employee
escrow account representing retention payments due to former
executives, and will be available for release from April 2007
through October 2007. As of December31, 2005, these
amounts are not yet earned and are not considered payable at

2004. In July 2002, Informatica filed an action for alleged
patent infringement against Acta, which was not resolved as of
December31, 2005 and therefore remains in the escrow
account.   In accordance with the escrow agreement, one-third of the total
amount in the escrow available to former Acta shareholders and
employees was paid during the three months ended June30,
2004. The escrow agreement provides that the remaining
two-thirds in the escrow account may be used by the Company to
offset costs incurred in defending itself against the
Informatica action and any damages arising therefrom. The
remaining balance, if any, will be distributed once all claims
related to the Informatica action are resolved. At
December31, 2005, the Company had incurred
$26million of costs associated with defending its
position against Informatica, which the Company will be eligible
to claim against the remaining amount in escrow.

Credit
Agreement   On December8, 2004, Business Objects entered into an
unsecured credit facility the Credit Agreement,
which was scheduled to terminate on December2, 2005.
This agreement was amended in December 2005 and January 2006 and
amended and restated in March 2006 and the Credit Agreement now
terminates in December 2006. The terms of the renewal were
essentially unchanged. The Credit Agreement provides for up to
100million which can be drawn in euros,
U.S.dollars or Canadian dollars. The Credit Agreement
consists of 60million to satisfy general corporate
financing requirements and a 40million bridge loan
for the purpose of acquiring companies
and/or for
medium- and long-term financings. The Credit Agreement restricts
certain of the Companys activities including the extension
of a mortgage, lien, pledge, security interest or other rights
related to all or part of its existing or future assets or
revenues, as security for any existing or future debt for money
borrowed.   Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the amount available is
reduced by the aggregate of all outstanding drawings. Drawings
are limited to advances in duration of 10days to
12months and must be at least equal to
1million or the converted currency equivalent in
U.S.dollars or Canadian dollars or a whole number multiple
of these amounts. All drawings and interest amounts are due on
the agreed upon credit repayment date determined at the time of
the drawing. Interest is calculated dependent on the currency in
which the draw originally occurs. The line is subject to a
commitment fee on the available funds, payable on the first day
of each quarter which is estimated at less than
$02million per annum. The terms of the agreement do not
allow for the prepayment of any drawings without the prior
approval of the lender. The Company has the option to reduce the
credit available in multiples of 5million, without
penalty. At December31, 2005, there were no balances
outstanding against this Credit Agreement.

Accounting
for and Disclosure of Guarantees   Guarantors Accounting for
Guarantees.From time to time, the Company enters
into certain types of contracts that require it to indemnify
parties contingently against third party claims. These contracts
primarily relate to: icertain real estate leases, under
which we may be required to indemnify property owners for
environmental and other liabilities, and other claims arising
from its use of the applicable premises; iicertain
agreements with the Companys officers, directors and
employees and third parties, under which we may be required to
indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their
duties to the Company; and iiiagreements under which the
Company indemnifies customers and partners for claims arising
from intellectual property infringement. The terms of such   
106 Table of Contents   Business Objects S.A.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not
explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts of these types
of agreements often are not explicitly stated, the overall
maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably
estimated. Historically, the Company has not been obligated to
make significant payments for these obligations, and as such no
liabilities were recorded for these obligations on the
Companys balance sheets as of December31, 2005 or
December31, 2004. The Company carries coverage under
certain insurance policies to protect it in the case of any
unexpected liability; however, this coverage may not be
sufficient.   The Company entered into an agreement to guarantee the
obligations of two of its subsidiaries to a maximum of
$1200million to fulfill their performance and payment of
all indebtedness related to all foreign exchange contracts with
a bank. At December31, 2005, there were two option
contracts with the bank under this guarantee in the aggregate
notional amount of Canadian $170million. In addition,
there were two forward contracts with the bank under this
guarantee denominated in various currencies in the aggregate
notional amount of $34million as converted to
U.S.dollars at the period end exchange rate. There was no
liability under this guarantee as the subsidiaries were not in
default of any contract at December31, 2005.   As approved by Board resolution on September30, 2004 and
executed during the three months ended December31, 2004,
the Company guaranteed the obligations of its Canadian
subsidiary in order to secure cash management arrangements with
a bank. At December31, 2005 there were no liabilities due
under this arrangement.   Product Warranties.The Company warrants to
its customers that its software products will operate
substantially in conformity with product documentation and that
the physical media will be free from defect. The specific terms
and conditions of the warranties are generally 30days but
may vary depending upon the country in which the product is
sold. For those customers purchasing maintenance contracts, the
warranty is extended for the period during which the software
remains under maintenance. The Company accrues for known
warranty issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably
estimated, and accrues for estimated incurred but unidentified
warranty claims, if any. Due to extensive product testing, the
short time between product shipments and the detection and
correction of product failures, no history of material warranty
claims, and the fact that no significant warranty issues have
been identified, the Company has not recorded a warranty accrual
to date.   Environmental Liabilities.The Company engages
in the development, marketing and distribution of software, and
has never had an environmental related claim. As such, the
likelihood of incurring a material loss related to environmental
indemnifications is remote and the Company is unable to
reasonably estimate the amount of any unknown or future claim.
As a result, the Company has not recorded any liability in
accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of
FASNo143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations FAS143.   Other Liabilities and Other Claims.The
Company is responsible for certain costs of restoring leased
premises to their original condition in accordance with the
recognition and measurement provisions of FAS143. The fair
value of these obligations at December31, 2005 or 2004 did
not represent material liabilities. These liabilities were not
associated with the Crystal Decisions restructuring plan.

Controls
and Procedures   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15e
as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on
Form10-K. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded these disclosure
controls and procedures are effective.   Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting for Business
Objects. Business Objects internal control system was
designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and
board of directors regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the fair presentation of published financial
statements.   There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any
internal control, including the possibility of human error and
the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even
effective internal controls can provide only reasonable
assurances with respect to financial statement preparation.
Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of
internal controls may vary over time.   Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005.
In making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework.   Based on our assessment using those criteria, we concluded that,
as of December31, 2005, our internal control over
financial reporting is effective.   As permitted under Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
we excluded the acquisitions of SRC, Infommersion and Medience
from the scope of the internal control evaluation. These
acquisitions represented approximately less than two percent of
total assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets as of
December31, 2005 and approximately less than one percent
of revenues for the year then ended.   Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein.   Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There were no significant changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2005.

SECTION16a
BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE   Section16a of the Exchange Act requires our executive
officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of our
registered class of equity securities to file reports of
ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Such executive
officers, directors and 10% stockholders are also required by
SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all forms that they file
pursuant to Section16a of the Exchange Act.   Based solely on our review of copies of Forms3 and 4 and
amendments thereto furnished to us pursuant to
Rule16a-3
and Forms5 and amendments thereto furnished to us with
respect to our last fiscal year, and any written representations
referred to in Item405b1 of
RegulationS-K
of the Securities Act stating that no Forms5 were
required, we believe that, during 2005, all Section16a
filing requirements applicable to our officers and directors
were complied with.   113 Table of Contents   THE AUDIT
COMMITTEE   The Audit Committee currently consists of Messrs.Heitz,
Lauk and Peterschmidt. The regulations of the Nasdaq National
Market require the Audit Committee to be comprised of at least
three independent members. Our Board of Directors has determined
that Messrs.Heitz, Lauk, and Peterschmidt meet the
independence requirements of the listing standards of the Nasdaq
National Market and that Mr.Heitz and Mr.Lauk are
audit committee financial experts as defined in the
rules of the SEC. Our Board of Directors created the Audit
Committee in October 1993 and the Audit Committee adopted a
written charter in June 2000. Our Board of Directors most
recently amended the Audit Committee charter in October 2005. A
copy of the charter is available on our web site at
www.businessobjects.com. The Audit Committee is
responsible for, among other things   
retaining, evaluating and terminating our independent and
statutory auditors subject to the powers that are expressly
reserved under French corporate law to the board of directors
and to the shareholders at annual general meetings   
reviewing the annual report of the independent and statutory
auditors   
reviewing the audit plan and scope with the independent and
statutory auditors and internal auditors   
reviewing with management, the independent, statutory and
internal auditors our quarterly financial statements,
semi-annual financial statements, annual financial statements
and disclosures, including disclosure controls and procedures
and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations prior to the public release
or filing of these statements

reviewing with them the results of their quarterly review,
annual audit and other examinations

services   
reviewing and approving any material accounting policy changes
affecting our operating results   
reviewing effectiveness and operation of our system of internal
controls and internal control over financial reporting   
reviewing and approving, subject to board of directors and
shareholders ratification if applicable, all related party
transactions;and

complaints regarding accounting, controls or auditing matters
and/or
corporate attorneys reports of evidence of a material
violation of securities laws   
reviewing and evaluating its performance and report such
evaluation to the board of directors at least once a year   
reviewing and evaluating whether it complies with its membership
requirements and take corrective action, as necessary, at least
once a year.   On June15, 2004, we sent a letter to the Nasdaq National
Market notifying the exchange of the Companys reliance on
an exemption to the requirements of Nasdaq National Market
Rule4350 on the basis of our status as a foreign issuer
subject to a law, regulation or rule of a public authority that
is contrary to the provisions of such Nasdaq National Market
rule. Nasdaq National Market Rule4350d3 requires audit
committee compliance with Exchange Act
Rule10A-3b2,
which in turn requires that the audit committee be
directly responsible for the appointment, compensation,
retention and oversight of the work of any registered public
accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing
an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest
services for the listed issuer, and each such registered public
accounting firm must report directly to the audit
committee. However,
ArticleL225-228
of the French Commercial Code requires that auditors be proposed
for appointment by the general meeting of the shareholders in a
draft resolution from the board of directors. French law
requires that the auditors are to be solely removed and
appointed by the shareholders and not the audit committee. Based
on the foregoing, compliance with Exchange Act
Rule10A-3b2
would be contrary to the law of the authority exercising
jurisdiction over our company and contrary to generally accepted
business practice in France, and we are thus exempted from
compliance with such Exchange Act Rule. As a result of this
exemption, the Audit Committee does   
114 Table of Contents   not have the powers of direct oversight over auditing firms
generally contemplated by the Nasdaq National Market listing
standards. We do not, however, believe that reliance on this
exemption has a material adverse affect on the performance of
the Audit Committee or the independence of our auditors.   In order to achieve its mission more effectively, the Audit
Committee holds a minimum of 4 meetings per year, meets with the
independent auditors without management and may consult with
external counsel when necessary.   We have adopted a Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and
Senior Financial Officers which applies to our principal
executive officer, unless we have both a Chief Executive Officer
and a President, in which case it is applicable to both, our
principal financial officer, our principal accounting officer,
controller and divisional vice presidents of finance. We have
also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to
all our employees with the exception of our French employees.
Finally, in order to comply with French law requirements, we
have also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for
French Employees which applies to all our directors, officers
and employees who are located in France. Our codes of ethics are
publicly available on our website at
www.businessobjects.com or are also available,
without charge to you, upon written request made to us at
157/159 rue
Anatole France, 92300 Levallois-Perret, France Attention: Legal
Department. Any waiver or amendment to any of our codes of
ethics pertaining to a member of our board or one of our
executive officers will be disclosed on our website at
www.businessobjects.com or in a Current Report on
Form8-K
filed with the SEC. The information contained on or connected to
our Internet website is not incorporated by reference into this
Annual Report on
Form10-K
and should not be considered part of this or any other report
that we file with or furnish to the SEC.   Procedure
for Submitting Shareholder Proposals   Under French corporate law, owners of our ordinary shares
holding, either alone or together with other owners of our
