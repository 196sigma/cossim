Item 8.      Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
HCIA INC. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HCIA Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1996. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of HCIA Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

HCIA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
On April 28, 1995, the Company acquired all of the capital stock of Datis
Corporation Datis for $14,250,000 in cash. Datis provided databases and
related analyses to hospitals and hospital systems. The goodwill amortization
period is based on the nature of Datis' products and markets and the historical
rates of change in the products and markets.
On December 15, 1995, the Company acquired the assets constituting the CHAMP
unit of William M. Mercer, Incorporated CHAMP for $17,500,000 in cash. CHAMP
provides database and analytical reporting services to large employers to assist
them in the management of their healthcare costs.
On May 15, 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Response
Healthcare Information Management, Inc. Response for $6,261,000 in cash.
Response develops and markets information products which capture and analyze
point-of-care, patient-centered data relating to disease-specific outcomes
measurement and member/patient satisfaction.
On August 9, 1996, the Company acquired all of the capital stock of LBA
Holdings, Inc. formerly HealthVision, Inc. and its operating subsidiary LBA
Health Care Management, Inc. LBA. The purchase price including acquisition
expenses was $128,829,000,  of which $100,114,000 was paid in cash and
$28,715,000 was paid through the delivery of 492,961 shares of the Company
common stock. LBA develops and markets information products that analyze and
benchmark detailed clinical and productivity outcomes. The cash portion of the
purchase price was funded primarily through a credit facility obtained from
First Union National Bank of North Carolina First Union consisting of a
$50,000,000 term loan and a $36,000,000 draw on a $50,000,000 revolving line of
credit see note 9. These loans were repaid with a portion of the proceeds from
the Company August 1996 public offering.
On December 2, 1996, the Company purchased all of the capital stock of Equifax
Health Analytical Services, Inc. HealthChex for $11,503,000 in cash. The
parties have agreed to make an election under Internal Revenue Code Sec.
338h10 to treat this acquisition as an asset purchase for tax purposes.
HealthChex provides physician profiling and medical claims review systems to
health care providers and payors.
The values and lives of the intangible assets and in-process research and
development costs obtained in the CHAMP,  Response,  LBA and HealthChex
acquisitions were determined by an independent appraiser. The lives and values
of the intangible assets were based on, among other things, employee retention
rates, customer retention rates and the historical rates of change in the
products and markets. The current fair value of in-process research and
development costs was determined, based on the risk-adjusted cash flows at
discount rates of 19% to 22%, of specifically identified technologies for which
technological feasibility had not yet been established pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed SFAS No. 86 and for which
future  alternative  uses did not exist.  Consideration of technological
feasibility for purposes of these calculations was given on a basis consistent
with that normally utilized by the Company see note 2d. Non-recurring charges
to write off these costs were recorded on the date of each acquisition. These
charges are recorded as operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.
During November 1995, the Company acquired an additional 36% interest in CHKS
Limited CHKS. As a result of this acquisition, CHKS became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company. The Company issued notes payable to the former
shareholders in the principal amount of $2,795,000. This acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and resulted in additional
goodwill of $2,709,000. The goodwill is being amortized over its estimated
useful life of 15 years. The estimate of the amortization period is based on the
nature of the products and markets of CHKS and the historical rate of change in
the products and markets.                    20 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
HCIA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Also during 1995, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of John Froehlich Associates, MetriCor Inc. and MetaGenerics. The
aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was $1,677,000, consisting of
cash of $1,166,000 and notes payable of $511,000. These acquisitions resulted in
increases in furniture and equipment of $75,000, increases in other intangible
assets of $1,938,000 and increases in current liabilities of $336,000. The other
intangible  assets consist of goodwill  which is being  amortized on a
straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of 10 to 15 years. The estimate
of each amortization period is based on the nature of the products and markets
of the acquired entities and the historical rate of change in the products and
markets.
During 1996 the Company also acquired all of the stock of IASIST S.A. and all of
the interests in Managed Marketing LLC. The aggregate purchase price for these
acquisitions was $2,713,000 and was paid in cash. These acquisitions resulted in
increases in current assets of $496,000, furniture and equipment of $85,000,
software of $303,000 and goodwill of $2,159,000, offset by increased current
liabilities of $330,000. The goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over its estimated useful life of 15 years. The estimate of each
amortization period is based on the nature of the products and markets of the
acquired entities and the historical rates of change in the products and
markets.
Unless otherwise noted, funding for the acquisitions discussed above was
provided from the proceeds of the Company public offerings. All of these
acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Unaudited pro forma combined results of the operations of the Company for the
years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996 are presented below and have been
prepared assuming that the acquisitions discussed above had been made as of
January 1, 1995.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries. The minority interest of CHKS for the periods before it became
wholly owned is stated separately on the financial statements. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
b Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid securities with original maturities of
three months or less at the date acquired by the Company. At December 31, 1995
and 1996, the Company short-term investments, which are classified as an
available for sale securities portfolio, consist of the following                        1995                 1996
Fair Value     Cost      Fair Value     Cost
Auction Market Preferred Stock  $ 7,000,000    $ 7,000,000     $   --     $   Variable Rate Debentures      5,500,000     5,500,000        --        Municipal Bonds          10,780,000    10,736,000     510,000     506,000
Total            $23,280,000    $23,236,000     $510,000     $506,000
The portfolio is carried at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities. All securities mature within one year. Realized gains and
losses are recorded using the specific identification basis to determine costs.
During 1995 and 1996, proceeds from sales of the securities totaled $46,077,000
and $82,370,000, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses on sales of the
securities were immaterial in 1995 and 1996.
c Furniture and Equipment
Furniture and equipment are stated at cost. Included in furniture and equipment
are computer hardware, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements. These
costs are being depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated
useful lives of three to five years.
d Computer Software Costs
Computer software costs include the cost of internally developed software and
the fair market value assigned to computer software obtained in purchase
transactions. Costs for internally developed software are capitalized in
accordance with SFAS No. 86. These costs relate primarily to the building of
production systems and extending existing applications to new markets or
platforms using existing technologies and programming methods. The Company
capitalizes only those costs incurred after a detailed program design or, in the
absence of such, a working prototype has been developed. The Company generally
develops its applications in connection with customer contracts and includes the
related costs as a component of operating expenses in the period incurred. The
Company capitalized or purchased a total of $2,603,000,  $7,260,000 and
$13,229,000 of computer software costs in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively,
including  $1,092,000 in 1995 and $558,000 in 1996 related to business
acquisitions.
Capitalized costs are amortized, beginning with market availability, over the
economic useful life of the product. Typically, this life is five years. The
annual amortization expense is the greater of the amount computed using a the
ratio that current gross revenues for a product bears to the total of current
and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight-line
method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the
period being reported.  Amortization  expense for computer  software was
$1,456,000, $2,048,000 and $3,816,000 during 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
Accumulated amortization for computer software was $6,510,000 and $10,326,000 at
December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, the recoverability of capitalized
software costs on the basis of whether such costs are fully recoverable from
projected undiscounted cash flows of individual system and product lines.                    22 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
e Revenue Recognition
Revenue from license fees for access to the Company databases is
recognized when access to the database is made available to the customer.
Revenue from custom system or database development and implementation contracts
is recognized on a percentage of completion  basis using the
cost-to-cost method. This method of accounting has resulted in unbilled accounts
receivable of $3,073,000 and $3,686,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1996,
respectively. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses whether the current
estimate of total contract costs for each of these contracts indicates a loss is
expected and accrues any such losses on the entire contract in that quarter.
Where the Company has contracted to provide both access to a Company database
and development of a custom database, the contract value is segmented into its
discrete elements according to their relative values, and revenue is recognized
separately on each element in accordance with the above.
Revenue from group data contracts, which obligate the Company to process data,
produce reports and update databases on periodic intervals, is recognized as the
contracted obligations are fulfilled.
Revenue from licensing of software products is recognized upon shipment,
provided that no vendor obligations remain outstanding. While the Company has no
significant post-contract support PCS obligations, any revenue related to
insignificant PCS obligations on software licenses is deferred and recognized
over the contract term. The Company determines the component of revenue
applicable to PCS obligations based upon its experience in fulfilling such
obligations.
Revenue on all other products is recognized when the product is shipped.
During 1994, one customer accounted for 12% of the Company revenue. At
December 31, 1994, receivables from that customer represented 12% of the
Company trade accounts receivable.  Consistent with Company policy, no
collateral or other security was held with respect to such trade accounts
receivable. During 1995 and 1996, no single customer accounted for 10% or more
of the Company revenue or trade accounts receivable.
f Foreign Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign operations are translated at
year-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at rates
prevailing during the period. Accordingly, translation adjustments that arise
due to fluctuations in exchange rates are excluded from operations and are
reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
g Income Taxes
Prior to the completion of the Company initial public offering in February
1995, the Company was party to a federal tax-sharing agreement with AMBAC and
was included in AMBAC consolidated federal income tax return. The tax-sharing
agreement provided for the determination of tax expense or benefit based on the
contribution of the Company to AMBAC tax liability, computed substantially as
if the Company filed a separate income tax return. The tax liability due AMBAC
was settled quarterly, with a final settlement taking place after the filing of
the consolidated federal tax return. Commencing February 22, 1995, the Company
was no longer included on a consolidated basis for tax purposes with AMBAC and
is responsible for filing its own federal income tax return.
The Company uses the asset and liability method required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting For Income Taxes, to
account for deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are
recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases of
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards based on enacted rates expected to be in effect when
such amounts are realized or settled. The effects of changes in tax laws or
rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in the period that
includes the enactment date.
h Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share has been calculated based upon the weighted average number of
shares outstanding and using the treasury stock method for outstanding stock
options. The number of shares used in this calculation has been adjusted to
reflect a one-for-three reverse stock split and the conversion of Class A and
Class B common stock into a single class of common stock see note 10. For
1994, the fair market value per share for the purpose of the calculation of the
weighted average shares outstanding was assumed to be $1100, which was the
mid-point of the Company initial public offering price range.                    23 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
i Accounting for Stock Options
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, APB No. 25 in accounting for its stock options.
Additional information required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS No. 123 is
discussed in Note 10.
j Use Of Estimates
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
k Reclassifications
Certain amounts for 1994 and 1995 have been reclassified to conform to the
presentation for 1996.

Databases consist of the fair market value of various acquired databases, the
cost of acquiring data and internal development costs direct labor and related
overhead incurred in standardizing data for use in internally developed
databases. These assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives of five years. Amortization expense for databases was
approximately $839,000, $962,000 and $1,067,000 during 1994, 1995 and 1996,
respectively.
24 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During 1992, the Company acquired an exclusive license to access and sell the
databases and certain other assets of the  Commission on Professional
and Hospital Activities CPHA. This license was recorded at its estimated
fair value of $8,073,000 at the date of acquisition and is being amortized
on a straight-line basis over 17 years. The amortization period was
determined to be the estimated economic life cycle of the licensed properties,
as corroborated by an independent appraisal, and reflected the remainder of the
existing term of the license at the date of acquisition plus one renewal term
provided under the terms of the agreement. Under the terms of the license, the
Company paid royalties to CPHA based on revenues earned utilizing the licensed
assets. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company and CPHA entered into a new
license agreement. Under the terms of the new agreement, the Company paid
$5,958,000 to CPHA in lieu of future royalty obligations. The payment is
recorded as prepaid CPHA royalties and is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over 17 years, consistent with the estimated economic life of the licensed
properties.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net
assets acquired. Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 to
20 years. Such amortization periods are estimated based on the nature of the
products and markets of the acquired companies and the historical rates of
changes in these products and market areas.
Customer bases, methodologies and assembled workforces were obtained through the
CHAMP, Response, LBA and HealthChex acquisitions. The values and lives of these
assets were determined by an independent appraiser based on factors such as
going concern value, employee turnover and historical customer retention rates.
Other intangibles consist of a trade name obtained in the CHAMP acquisition and
certain non-competition agreements. The value and life of the tradename was
determined by an independent appraiser. The non-competition agreements are
amortized over their 1 to 2 year terms commencing with the date the employees
are no longer employed by the Company.

The Company applies APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
stock options. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized in
connection with its stock options. Had compensation expense for the Company
stock options been determined consistent with SFASNo. 123, the Company net
income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts
indicated below                      1994      1995      1996
Net Income       As reported   $1,021     $2,405    $42,267
Pro forma   $ 812     $2,996    $43,795
Earnings per share   As reported   $ 019     $ 031    $ 419
Pro forma   $ 015     $ 039    $ 434
The fair value of the options for purposes of the above pro forma disclosure was
calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following
assumptions: a risk-free interest rate of 658%, weighted average expected life
of six to seven years, no dividend payments and a volatility of 3129% based on
the annualized 10 year industry average. The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 in
the pro forma net income and earnings per share for 1994, 1995 and 1996 may not
be representative of the effects on such pro forma information for future years.                    29 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
11 DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable,
other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and capital lease
obligations approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these
instruments. The fair value of short-term investments is estimated based on
quoted market prices for these or similar investments. The Company has notes
payable to individuals relating to certain of its business acquisitions. It is
not practicable to estimate the fair value of these notes since they are not
traded, no quoted values are readily available for similar financial instruments
and the Company believes it is not cost-effective to have valuations performed.
However, management believes that there has been no permanent change in the
value of such notes.                    30 Item 4.      Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
