Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Rockwell Automation, Inc. the Company or Rockwell Automation is a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a
competitive advantage for their businesses. Basis of Presentation Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto relate to our continuing operations.
In March 2006, we sold the assets of our ElectroCraft Engineered Solutions ElectroCraft business. ElectroCraft is
reported as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. On
January31, 2007, we divested our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses to Baldor Electric Company Baldor. These were the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. These
businesses are reported as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned and controlled majority owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which we have the ability to exert significant influence, but that
we do not control and are not the primary beneficiary of, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our proportional share of the respective affiliate earnings or losses is included in other income in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. Investments in affiliates over which we do not have the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. These affiliated companies are not material individually or in the
aggregate to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. We use estimates in accounting for, among other items, customer returns, rebates and incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete inventory; share based compensation; acquisitions; product warranty
obligations; retirement benefits; litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental matters, conditional asset retirement obligations and contractual indemnifications; and income taxes. We account for changes to estimates and assumptions
prospectively when warranted by factually based experience. Revenue Recognition Product and solution revenues consist of industrial automation power, control, information and custom-engineered hardware and software
products and systems. Service revenues include multi-vendor customer technical support and repair, asset management and optimization consulting and training. For approximately 85 percent of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is
reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered.

We recognize revenue for software products and related services in accordance with
Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction-type contracts using either the percentage-of-completion or completed contract method of accounting. We record sales relating to these
contracts using the percentage-of-completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we recognize
sales and gross profit as work is performed using either ithe relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or iiunits-of-delivery. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we adjust sales and
gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified. We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and customer
acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility
based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Returns, Rebates and Incentives Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturer OEM customer to whom our
distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program
criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations. We record
accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of sale based primarily on historical experience. Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates
and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of set-off exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable.
Taxes on Revenue Producing Transactions Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing transactions, including sales, value added, excise and use taxes, are recorded on a net basis excluded from revenue. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Receivables We record allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of
$174 million at September30, 2008 and $124 million at September30, 2007. In addition, receivables are stated net of an allowance for certain customer returns, rebates and incentives of $132 million at September30, 2008 and $81
million at September30, 2007.

Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out FIFO or average cost methods. Market is determined
on the basis of estimated realizable values. Property Property, including internal use software, is stated at cost. We calculate depreciation of property using the straight-line method over 15
to 40 years for buildings and improvements, 3 to 14 years for machinery and equipment and 3 to 10 years for computer hardware and internal use software. We capitalize significant renewals and enhancements and write off replaced units. We expense
maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amounts. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions. We account for business acquisitions by allocating the
purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values; the excess of the purchase price over the allocated amount is recorded as goodwill. SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives to be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may be present. Any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. We perform an annual
impairment test during the second quarter of our fiscal year. We amortize certain customer relationships on an accelerated
basis over the period of which we expect the intangible asset to generate future cash flows. We amortize all other intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful lives assigned range
from 7 to 20 years for customer relationships, 3 to 17 years for technology and 3 to 10 years for other intangible assets. Intangible assets also include costs of software developed by our software business to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed, as accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed SFAS 86. Amortization of developed computer software products is calculated on a product-by-product basis as the greater of athe unamortized cost at the beginning of the
year times the ratio of the current year gross revenue for a product to the total of the current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product, bthe straight-line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product
or cone-fourth of the total deferred software cost for the project. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired,
we measure the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair
value using a discounted future cash flow analysis. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to
manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. We use foreign currency forward 
45  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies Continued 
exchange contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with certain third-party sale and intercompany transactions expected to
occur within the next two years cash flow hedges and changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. We sometimes use
interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt. Our accounting method for derivative financial instruments is based upon the designation of such instruments as hedges under accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. It is our policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All foreign currency forward
exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. Foreign Currency Translation
We translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States with a functional currency
other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the end of the respective period. We translate sales, costs and expenses at average exchange rates effective during the respective period. We report foreign currency translation
adjustments as a component of other comprehensive income. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations in the period incurred. Research and Development Expenses We expense research and
development RD costs as incurred; these costs were $1913 million in 2008, $1669 million in 2007 and $1485 million in 2006. We include RD expenses in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Income Taxes Prior to October1, 2007, we recorded a liability for income tax exposures when they were probable and the amount could be reasonably estimated. Tax benefits related to claims were also recognized when they became probable and
reasonably estimable. When determining the probability and the estimability of the liability or tax benefit, we considered the relevant tax law as applied to us by the particular country, state, or other taxing authority. Beginning October1, 2007, we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. For tax
positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the tax position to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
tax expense. Earnings Per Share We present basic and diluted earnings per share EPS amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted
EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding share-based compensation awards, which requires us to
compute total employee proceeds as the sum of athe amount the employee must pay upon exercise of the award, bthe amount of unearned share-based compensation costs attributed to future services and cthe amount of tax benefits,
if any, that would be credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of the award. Share-based compensation awards for which the total employee proceeds of the award exceed the average market price of the same award over the period have an
antidilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, we exclude them from the calculation. Antidilutive share-based compensation awards for the years ended September30, 2008 28 million shares, 2007 14 million shares and 2006 09 million shares
were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.

1799 Share-Based Compensation We recognize share-based compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards generally on a straight-line basis over the
service period of each award recipient. We report the tax benefit from the tax deduction related to share-based compensation that is in excess of recognized compensation costs excess tax benefits as a financing cash flow rather than as an
operating cash flow as required by SFAS 123R, Share Based Payment. Product and Workers Compensation
Liabilities We record accruals for product and workers compensation claims in the period in which they are
probable and reasonably estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product liability and workers compensation where we self-insure up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered
by policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority of the self-insured claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued. Environmental Matters We record accruals for environmental
matters in the period in which our responsibility is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. We make changes to the accruals in the periods in which the estimated costs of remediation change. At environmental sites for which more than one
potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or
unidentified parties. At environmental sites for which we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount to their present value future expenditures for environmental remediation
obligations. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable, we record a receivable for the estimated recovery. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations We account for conditional asset retirement
obligations under Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations FIN 47. We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a
tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may
be conditional.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS 158, became effective for us as of September30, 2007. SFAS 158 requires us to recognize an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheet reflecting the funded status of our pension
and other postretirement benefit plans, with current-year changes in the funded status recognized in shareowners equity. SFAS 158 did not change the existing criteria for measurement of periodic benefit costs, plan assets or benefit
obligations. Additionally, SFAS 158 will require us to measure the funded status on the date of our annual audited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September30, 2009. In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities FSP EITF
03-6-1. FSP EITF 03-6-1 specifies that unvested share-based awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the
two-class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for us beginning in 2010. We are evaluating FSP EITF 03-6-1 to determine the effect on our financial statements and related disclosures. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets FSP FAS 142-3. FSP FAS 142-3
intends to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141
Revised 2007, Business Combinations SFAS 141R and other accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. FSP FAS 142-3 will apply to us beginning in 2010. We are evaluating FSP FAS 142-3 to determine the effect on our
financial statements and related disclosures. In March 2008, the FASB issues SFAS No161, Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No133 SFAS 161. SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosures required by SFAS 133 so that they provide an enhanced understanding of how and why a company
uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and
cash flows. SFAS 161 will apply to us beginning in the second quarter of 2009. We do not believe SFAS 161 will have a material effect on our financial statements; we will expand our disclosures in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 161 upon
adoption. In March 2008, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No08-3, Accounting by Lessees
for Maintenance Deposits Under Lease Arrangements EITF 08-3. EITF 08-3 requires that all nonrefundable maintenance deposits be accounted for as a deposit, and expensed or capitalized when underlying maintenance is performed. If it is
determined that an amount on deposit is not probable of being used to fund future maintenance, it is to be recognized as expense at the time such determination is made. EITF 08-3 is effective for us beginning in 2010. We are evaluating EITF 08-3 to
determine the effect on our financial statements and related disclosures. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No141R. SFAS 141R requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. SFAS 141R also
requires the acquirer to recognize and measure the goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and prescribes how to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. It also provides guidance
for the accounting of pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies and acquisition-related transaction costs. SFAS 141R will apply to us beginning in 2010. We are evaluating the statement to determine the effect on our financial statements and
related disclosures.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB No51 SFAS 160. SFAS 160 amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and establishes a single method of accounting for
changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in deconsolidation. SFAS 160 will apply to us beginning in 2010. We are evaluating the statement to determine the effect on our financial statements and related
disclosures. In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends
on Share-Based Payment Awards EITF 06-11. EITF 06-11 specifies how companies should recognize the income tax benefit received on dividends that are apaid to employees holding equity-classified nonvested shares, equity-classified
nonvested share units, or equity-classified outstanding share options and bcharged to retained earnings under SFAS 123R. EITF 06-11 is effective for us beginning in 2009. We do not believe EITF 06-11 will have a material effect on our
financial statements and related disclosures. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS 159. SFAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and certain other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS
159 is effective for us beginning in 2009. We have not elected the fair value option allowed under SFAS 159. In September
2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It also establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability. SFAS 157 will apply to us beginning in fiscal 2009 for financial assets and liabilities and fiscal 2010 for non-financial assets and
liabilities. We do not believe SFAS 157 will have a material effect on our financial statements for financial assets and liabilities; we will expand our disclosures for financial assets and liabilities in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 157
upon adoption. We are evaluating the statement to determine the effect on our financial statements and related disclosures for non-financial assets and liabilities.  2.
Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions During 2008, our Architecture Software segment acquired
CEDES Safety Automation AG CEDES, Incuity Software, Inc. Incuity, and Pavilion Technologies, Inc. Pavilion. The aggregate purchase price of these three acquisitions was $1129 million in cash. We acquired CEDES in May 2008. Swiss-based CEDES is a supplier of safety and measuring light curtains, as well as other safety and
non-safety optoelectronics, control units and related accessories for industrial applications. We also acquired Incuity, which is a supplier of Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence EMI software, in May 2008. Incuitys software provides
real-time intelligence for business decision support to improve operations and reduce production waste by providing valuable management insight into a companys operations. We acquired Pavilion, a company that is a recognized leader in advanced
process control, production optimization and environmental compliance solutions for process and hybrid industries, in November 2007. We recorded intangible assets of $419 million and goodwill of $699 million resulting from the preliminary purchase price allocations of the CEDES, Incuity and Pavilion acquisitions, which are pending the
finalization of the intangible asset valuations and other matters. Preliminary intangible assets assigned include $323 million to

technology 15-year weighted average useful life, $11 million to customer relationships 16-year weighted average useful life and $85 million to other
intangible assets 9-year weighted average useful life. We assigned the full amount of goodwill to our Architecture Software segment. None of the goodwill recorded is expected to be deductible for local tax purposes. In fiscal 2007, our Control Products Solutions segment acquired Industrial Control Services Group Limited, which does business
as ICS Triplex, and ProsCon Holdings Ltd. ProsCon. The aggregate purchase price of these two acquisitions was approximately $2688 million in cash. ICS Triplex, headquartered in the United Kingdom and acquired in July 2007, is a leading global supplier of critical control and safety solutions to process industries. It develops, delivers and maintains advanced
products and solutions for high availability, fault-tolerant applications in process industry segments worldwide. It serves primarily the oil and gas, chemicals and power generation industries. ProsCon is a process solutions systems integrator headquartered in Ireland that we acquired in February 2007. Its areas of expertise
include process technology and control systems and information technology, and it serves customers primarily in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. We recorded intangible assets of $1217 million resulting from the final purchase price allocations of the ICS Triplex and ProsCon acquisitions. Intangible assets assigned include $495 million
to customer relationships 12-year weighted average useful life, $283 million to technology 10-year weighted average useful life, $144 million to other intangible assets 7-year weighted average useful life and $295 million to intangible
assets not subject to amortization related to the ICS Triplex trademark. We recorded a charge of $13 million during the fourth quarter of 2007 for in-process research and development in cost of sales related to the acquisition of ICS
Triplex. We recognized goodwill of $1420 million related to these transactions, none of which is expected to be deductible for local tax purposes. We assigned the full amount of goodwill to our Control Products Solutions segment.
In May 2006, our Architecture Software segment acquired GEPA mbH, a provider of change management software for
industrial automation, process control and industrial information technology. In January 2006, our Control Products Solutions segment acquired Caribbean Integration Engineers, Inc. CIE. CIE offers engineering services in control systems
integration, process automation, computer system validation and IT solutions. Our Architecture Software segment also acquired Datasweep, Inc., a provider of production management software, in December 2005. During 2006, in connection with the purchase price allocations of Datasweep, Inc., CIE and GEPA mbH, we recorded intangible assets of
$223 million, of which $108 million was assigned to technology and $41 million was assigned to customer relationships. The remainder is classified as other intangible assets. The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations since the
dates of acquisition. Pro forma financial information and allocation of the purchase price is not presented as the individual effects of these acquisitions are not material to our results of operations and financial position. Divestitures On January31, 2007, we divested our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses to Baldor. These were the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. See Note 13 for more

565% notes due 2017 and 625% debentures due 2037. The debt offering yielded approximately $4935 million of proceeds, which were used to repay at maturity our 615% notes due January15, 2008 and for general corporate purposes. We issued an aggregate of $800 million principal amount of our 615% notes, 670% debentures and 520% debentures in January 1998. The
debt offering yielded approximately $7500 million of proceeds. We issued the 520% debentures at a discount, and the 615% notes and 670% debentures at par. In September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract the Swap that effectively converted our $3500 million aggregate principal amount of 615% notes, payable in 2008, to floating
rate debt based on six-month LIBOR. The floating rate was 780 percent at September30, 2007. As permitted by SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, as amended, we designated the Swap
as a fair value hedge. Accordingly, the fair value of the Swap was recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the underlying debt at September30, 2007. The fair
value of the Swap, based upon quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities, was a liability of $18 million at September30, 2007. The Swap matured on January15, 2008.

Long-term and Short-term Debt Continued 
On October26, 2004, we entered into a five-year $6000 million unsecured
revolving credit facility. Our $6000 million credit facility remains in effect and we have not drawn down under it at September30, 2008 or 2007. Borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market rates in
effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of our credit facility contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt-to-total-capital ratio was to exceed 60 percent. We were in compliance with all covenants
under our credit facility at September30, 2008 and 2007. In addition to our $6000 million credit facility, short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $1677 million at September30, 2008 were available to foreign
subsidiaries. There were no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under any of our credit facilities. Borrowings under our credit facilities during 2008 and 2007 were not significant. Our short-term debt obligations primarily relate to commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding were $1000
million at September30, 2008 and $1730 million at September30, 2007. At September30, 2008 the weighted average interest rate and maturity period of the commercial paper outstanding were 225 percent and six days, respectively. At
September30, 2007 the weighted average interest rate and maturity period of the commercial paper outstanding were 51 percent and three days, respectively. Interest payments were $634 million during 2008, $643 million during 2007 and $586 million during 2006.  7.

Product Warranty Obligations We record a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical warranty experience. Most of our products are covered under a warranty period that runs for twelve months
from either the date of sale or from installation to an end-user or OEM customer. We also record a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and reasonably estimable. Our product warranty obligations are included in other
current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in product warranty obligations are in millions:

Financial Instruments Our financial instruments include long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and an interest rate swap that matured on January15, 2008. The following is a summary of the carrying value and fair

We base the fair value of long-term debt upon quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues. We base the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange rates. At September30, 2008 and 2007, we had outstanding foreign
currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts relating to the Swiss franc, euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Singapore dollar. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts were recorded in other current
assets in the amounts of $61 million as of September30, 2008 and $52 million as of September30, 2007, other assets in the amount of $51 million as of September30, 2008, other current liabilities in the amounts of $162 million
as of September30, 2008 and $382 million as of September30, 2007 and other liabilities in the amount of $84 million as of September30, 2008. We designated certain foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to certain
forecasted third-party sales and intercompany transactions as cash flow hedges. The amount recognized in earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was not significant. We also hold financial instruments consisting of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt. The carrying value of
these assets and liabilities as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair value.

Shareowners Equity Common Stock At September30, 2008, the authorized stock of the Company
consisted of one billion shares of common stock, par value $100 per share, and 25million shares of preferred stock, without par value. At September30, 2008, 181million shares of common stock were reserved for various incentive
plans. Changes in outstanding common shares are summarized as follows in millions:  2008 2007 2006 Beginning balance

of September30, 2008 will be reclassified into earnings during 2009. We expect that these unrealized losses will be offset when the hedged items are recognized in earnings. Unrealized gains on investment securities as of September30, 2007 includes $25 million of unrealized income, net of tax, related
to our remaining investment in Baldor common stock acquired in the sale of the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. The investment was recorded in other current assets as an available-for-sale security with a fair
value of $340 million at September30, 2007. We sold all of the remaining Baldor common stock during 2008, in connection with which we recognized a pre-tax gain of $62 million.

Share-Based Compensation During 2008, 2007, and 2006 we recognized $325 million, $290 million and $256 million in share-based compensation expense in income from continuing operations, respectively. The total income tax benefit related to
share-based compensation recorded in continuing operations was $110 million during 2008, $102 million during 2007 and $88 million during 2006. We recognize compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards generally on a
straight-line basis over the service period of each award recipient. As of September30, 2008, total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards was $326 million, net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to
recognize over a weighted average period of approximately 18 years. Our 2008 Long-Term Incentives Plan 2008 Plan
authorizes us to deliver up to 72million shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options, or upon grant or in payment of stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units, restricted stock units and restricted stock.
Our 2003 Directors Stock Plan, as amended, authorizes us to deliver up to 05million shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options or upon grant of shares of our common stock and restricted stock units. Shares relating to awards
under our 2008 Plan or our 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan that terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance or delivery of shares will be available for further awards under the 2008 Plan. Approximately
73million shares under our 2008 Plan and 04million shares under our 2003 Directors Stock Plan remain available for future grant or payment at September30, 2008. After September30, 2008, 02million potential shares to
be delivered under performance share awards were forfeited under the 2000 Plan and are now available for future awards under the 2008 Plan. We use treasury stock to deliver shares of our common stock under these plans. Our 2008 Plan does not permit
share-based compensation awards to be granted after February6, 2018. Stock Options We have granted non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase our common stock under various incentive plans at prices equal to
the fair market value of the stock on the grant dates. The exercise price for stock options granted under the plans may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares. Stock options expire ten years after the grant date
and vest ratably over three years. The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years
ended September30, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $1757, $2002 and $1767, respectively. We estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions:  2008 2007 2006 Average risk-free interest rate
334 459 435 Expected dividend yield
178 147 156 Expected volatility
028 031 032 Expected term years
53 54 53
The average risk-free interest rate is based on the five-year U.S. treasury
security rate in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using a weighted
average of daily historical volatility of our stock price over the past five years. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data adjusted for the estimated exercise dates of unexercised options.

Performance Share Awards Certain officers and key employees are also eligible to receive shares of our common stock in payment of performance share awards granted
to them. Grantees of performance shares will be eligible to receive shares of our common stock depending upon our total shareowner return, assuming reinvestment of all dividends, relative to the performance of the SP 500 over a three-year
period. A summary of performance share activity for the years ended September30, 2008, 2007, and 2006 is as follows:  Shares inthousands Outstanding at September 30, 2005 Granted

The per share fair value of performance share awards granted during the year ended September30, 2008, 2007 and 2006

Retirement Benefits We sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for our employees. The pension plans cover most of our employees and provide for monthly pension payments to eligible employees after retirement. Pension
benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit amounts and years of service. Our policy with respect to funding
our pension obligations is to fund the minimum amount required by applicable laws and governmental regulations. We may, however, at our discretion, fund amounts in excess of the minimum amount required by laws and regulations, as we did in 2007 and
2006. Other postretirement benefits are primarily in the form of retirement medical plans that cover most of our United States employees and provide for the payment of certain medical costs of eligible employees and dependents after retirement.

September30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also in 2007, we recognized a pension curtailment loss of $04 million, an other postretirement benefits curtailment gain of $451 million and an additional other postretirement benefits settlement
gain of $110 million. These costs, loss and gains are related to our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses and the sale thereof and are reflected in income from discontinued operations in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, we retained the pension liability related to eligible Power Systems participants in our U.S.
Plan and Canada Salary Plan and the other postretirement benefit liability for eligible U.S. non-union and Canada Salary retirees as of the date of the sale, which will result in ongoing net periodic benefit cost for us. Pension liabilities for our
Canada Hourly Plan and Mexico Dodge Plan, as well as other postretirement liabilities, including for U.S. union active and retiree participants, have been transferred with the sale of these businesses.

other comprehensive loss at September30, 2007. We expect to recognize prior service credits of $151 million $93 million net of tax, net actuarial losses of $267 million $170 million net of tax and a net transition obligation of $04
million $03 million net of tax in pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit cost in 2009, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at September30, 2008. In 2007 and 2006 we voluntarily contributed $80 million and $4500 million, respectively, to our U.S. qualified pension plan trust.
The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans is $2,3167 million as of the 2008 measurement date and $2,3164
million as of the 2007 measurement date. We use an actuarial measurement date of June30 to measure our benefit
obligations, plan assets and to calculate our net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. Net Periodic Benefit Cost Assumptions Significant assumptions used in determining net periodic benefit cost

The healthcare cost trend rate reflects the estimated increase in gross medical claims costs as required to be disclosed by SFAS No132, Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. As a result of the plan amendment adopted effective October1, 2002, our effective per person retiree medical cost increase is zero percent beginning in 2005 for the majority of
our postretirement benefit plans. For our other plans, we assume the gross healthcare cost trend rate will decrease to 550% in 2017.  2
Decreasing to 450% in 2017. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we equally consider the historical performance and the future expected performance for returns for each asset category, as well as the target
asset allocation of the pension portfolios. This resulted in the selection of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Our global weighted-average asset allocations at September30, by asset category, are: AllocationRange TargetAllocation September30 Asset Category 2008 2007 Equity Securities
50%-70 56 54 65 Debt Securities
20%-75 41 42 34 Other
0%-15 3 4 1 The investment objective for pension funds related to our defined benefit plans is
to meet the plans benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without undue risk. We strive to achieve this objective by investing plan assets within target allocation ranges and diversification within asset
categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring of
investment manager performance relative to the investment guidelines established for each manager. As of
September30, 2008 and 2007, our pension plans do not own our common stock. In certain countries in which we operate,
there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, we typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they become due, rather than by creating a separate pension
fund.

million with no income tax effect. We also recorded a net charge of $16 million $10 million after tax related to resolutions of certain claims and professional service fees related to discontinued operations matters, offset by a benefit related
to legal matters associated with the former Rockwell International Corporations RICs operation of the Rocky Flats facility for the U.S. Department of Energy DOE. In 2006, we recorded a $50 million $30 million after tax accrual for legal contingencies related to RICs operation of the Rocky

Special Charges 
In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded special charges of $507 million $340
million after tax or $023 per diluted share related to restructuring actions designed to better align resources with growth opportunities and to reduce costs as a result of current and anticipated market conditions. This current year charge was
partially offset by the reversal of $40 million $36 million net of tax or $002 per diluted share of severance accruals established as part of our 2007 restructuring actions, as employee attrition differed from our original estimates.
The 2008 restructuring actions include workforce reductions aimed at streamlining administrative functions, realigning
selling resources to the highest anticipated growth opportunities and consolidating business units. The majority of the charges relate to severance benefits recognized pursuant to SFAS No112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits An Amendment of FASB Statements No5 and 43. In the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September30, 2008, $41 million of the special charges was recorded in cost of sales, while $466 million was
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. We expect total cash expenditures associated with the 2008 actions to be approximately $507 million. We made no significant payments related to these charges before September30, 2008.
During 2007, we recorded special charges of $435 million $277 million after tax or $017 per diluted share related to
various restructuring actions designed to execute on our cost productivity initiatives and to advance our globalization strategy. Actions include workforce reductions, realignment of administrative functions, and rationalization and consolidation of
global operations. In the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September30, 2007, $218 million of the special charges was recorded in cost of sales, while $217 million was recorded in selling, general and administrative
expenses. We paid $166 million related to these charges during the year ended September30, 2008 and $53 million during the year ended September30, 2007. Accruals remaining under our 2007 restructuring actions were $158 million at

We have not provided U.S. deferred taxes for any portion of $1,2390 million of
undistributed earnings of the Companys subsidiaries, since these earnings have been, and under current plans will continue to be, permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes
which may be payable upon distribution. We believe it is more likely than not that we will realize current and long-term
deferred tax assets through the reduction of future taxable income, other than for the deferred tax assets reflected below. Significant factors we considered in determining the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include our

retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the
jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the
final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as of October1, 2007. As a result, we recognized a $67 million decrease in shareowners equity. As of the date of adoption, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was
$1165 million $714 million, net of $451 million of offsetting indirect tax benefits. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would have reduced our effective tax rate if recognized was $376 million. The balance of $338 million was
attributable to discontinued operations and would not have impacted the effective tax rate for continuing operations if recognized.

A reconciliation of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and
penalties, for 2008 is as follows in millions:  Balance as of October1, 2007 1165 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 145 Additions based on tax positions related to prior years 01 Reductions based on tax positions related to prior years 13 Reductions related to settlements with taxing authorities 23 Reductions related to lapses of statute of limitations 08 Reduction due to effect of foreign currency translation 09 Balance as of September30, 2008 1258 As of September30, 2008, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $1258
million $766 million, net of $492 million of offsetting indirect tax benefits. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized was $432 million. The balance of $334 million was attributable to
discontinued operations and would not impact the effective tax rate for continuing operations if recognized. We believe it
is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to $10 million during the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of worldwide tax matters and the lapses of statutes of limitations. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were $240
million and $20 million at September30, 2008 and $168 million and $20 million at September30, 2007, respectively. We recognized $83 million of interest and $03 million of penalties during 2008. We conduct business globally and are routinely audited by the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Our U.S. federal tax returns
for 2006 through 2008, Wisconsin tax returns for 2003 through 2008, and tax returns for other major states and foreign jurisdictions for 1998 through 2008 remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.  17.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Environmental Matters Federal, state and local requirements relating to the
discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have and will continue to have an effect on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with environmental
requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. We have been designated as a potentially responsible party at 12 Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose no
involvement or as to which our potential liability has been finally determined and assumed by third parties. We estimate the total reasonably possible costs we could incur for the remediation of Superfund sites at September30, 2008 to be $100
million, of which $42 million has been accrued. Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against
us alleging violations of federal, state and local environmental protection requirements, or seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously owned properties. As of September30, 2008, we have estimated the
total reasonably possible costs we could incur from these matters to be $876 million. We have recorded 
72  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  17.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Continued 
environmental accruals for these matters of $291 million. In addition to the above matters, we assumed certain other environmental liabilities related to
Federal Pacific Electric, a former subsidiary of Reliance, in connection with the 1995 acquisition of Reliance, which we have retained following the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses. We
are substantially indemnified by ExxonMobil Corporation Exxon for matters for which we gave Exxon notice by December29, 2006. At September30, 2008, we have recorded a liability of $227 million and a receivable of $216 million for
these matters. We estimate the total reasonably possible costs for these matters to be $273 million for which we are substantially indemnified by Exxon. Matters arising after December29, 2006 are not indemnified by Exxon. Based on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with
present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. We
cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations 
Effective September30, 2006, we adopted FIN 47, which clarifies the guidance included in SFAS No143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. Under FIN 47, companies must accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction,
development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and
previously divested facilities. We estimated conditional asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. The application of FIN 47 resulted in a charge, net of tax, of $177 million included in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September30, 2006 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. At September30, 2008, we have recorded liabilities for these asset retirement obligations of $51
million in other current liabilities and $228 million in other liabilities. We recorded $53 million in other current liabilities and $218 million in other liabilities for these obligations at September30, 2007. Pro forma amounts, as if FIN 47 had been applied for all periods, are in millions, except per share amounts:  2006 Net income, as reported 6070 Add: FIN 47 cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax 177 Less: FIN 47 depreciation and accretion expense, net of tax 10 Pro forma net income 6237 Earnings per share Basic as reported 344 Basic pro forma 353 Diluted as reported 337 Diluted pro forma 347 Pro forma asset retirement obligation, end of period 287

lease terms in excess of one year aggregated $37 million as of September30, 2008 and are primarily receivable in 2009. Most leases contain renewal options for varying periods, and certain leases include options to purchase the leased
property. During 2006, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction of eight properties, including the land, buildings and
improvements affixed to the properties. The lease terms vary from five to fifteen years depending on the property and are classified as operating leases. The net proceeds on sale were approximately $899 million. Two of the sold properties resulted
in a loss of $16 million that we recognized during 2006, with the remaining properties resulting in a gain on sale of $211 million that will be amortized to rent expense over the term of the respective leases. The net book value of the sold assets
has been removed from our balance sheet. Other Matters Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our
business, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or
proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. We including our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos
that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. Currently there are thousands of claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of other companies. In some cases, the claims involve products from
divested businesses, and we are indemnified for most of the costs. However, we have agreed to defend and indemnify asbestos claims associated with products manufactured or sold by our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair
services businesses prior to their divestiture by us, which occurred on January31, 2007. We are also responsible for half of the costs and liabilities associated with asbestos cases against RICs divested measurement and flow control
business. But in all cases, for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the
integrity of the products, the encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the
vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Continued 
We have maintained insurance coverage that we believe covers indemnity and defense
costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for claims arising from our former Allen-Bradley subsidiary. Following litigation against Nationwide Indemnity Company and Kemper Insurance, the insurance carriers that provided liability insurance
coverage to Allen-Bradley, we entered into separate agreements on April1, 2008 with both insurance carriers to further resolve responsibility for ongoing and future coverage of Allen-Bradley asbestos claims. In exchange for a lump sum payment,
Kemper bought out its remaining liability and has been released from further insurance obligations to Allen-Bradley. Nationwide will receive and administer the Kemper buyout funds and has entered into a cost share agreement to pay the substantial
majority of future defense and indemnity costs for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims once the Kemper buy-out funds are depleted. We believe that these arrangements will continue to provide coverage for Allen-Bradley asbestos claims throughout the
remaining life of the asbestos liability. The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict
accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on our
experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with such divestitures, lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the
businesses. In connection with the divestiture of our former aerospace and defense businesses the AD Business to
The Boeing Company Boeing, we agreed to indemnify Boeing for certain matters related to operations of the AD Business for periods prior to the divestiture. We have recorded an accrual of $45 million for these matters. In connection with the
spin-offs of our former automotive component systems business, semiconductor systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to indemnify us for substantially all contingent liabilities
related to the respective businesses, including environmental and intellectual property matters. In conjunction with the
sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, we agreed to indemnify Baldor for costs and damages related to certain legal, legacy environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses, including
certain damages pertaining to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, arising before January31, 2007, for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the amount received for the sale. We estimate the potential future payments we could incur under
these indemnifications may approximate $276 million, of which $105 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and $129 million has been accrued in other liabilities at September30, 2008. We recorded $96 million and $161 million
in other current liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, at September30, 2007 for these indemnifications. In many countries we provide a limited intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms and conditions of sale. We also at times provide limited intellectual property indemnities in other contracts with third parties, such as contracts
concerning the development and manufacture of our products, the divestiture of businesses and the licensing of intellectual property. Due to the number of agreements containing such provisions, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential future
payments.

upon segment operating earnings before income taxes, interest expense, costs related to corporate offices, certain nonrecurring corporate initiatives, gains and losses from the disposition of businesses, earnings and losses from equity affiliates
that are not considered part of the operations of a particular segment and incremental acquisition related expenses resulting from purchase accounting adjustments such as intangible asset amortization, depreciation, inventory and purchased research
and development charges. Depending on the product, intersegment sales within a single legal entity are either at cost or cost plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market price. Sales between legal entities are at an appropriate
transfer price. We allocate costs related to shared segment operating activities to the segments using a methodology consistent with the expected benefit.

79  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Rockwell Automation, Inc. Milwaukee, Wisconsin We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rockwell Automation, Inc. the Company as of September30, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareowners equity, cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended September30, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
a2.We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk.Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion
or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Rockwell Automation, Inc. as of September30, 2008 and 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September30, 2008, in conformity 
80  
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of September30, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on October1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on September30, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard
No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106, and 132R. /s/DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin November17, 2008 
81  Item1B.Unresolved Staff Comments  None. Item2.Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness, as of September30, 2008, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15e and Rule
15d-15e of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September30, 2008. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based upon that evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of September30, 2008. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September30,
2008 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, as stated in their report that is included on the previous two pages. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting As previously disclosed, we are in the process of
developing and implementing common global process standards and an enterprise-wide information technology system. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we deployed new business processes and functionality of the system related to our travel and expense
reporting, time reporting, and purchasing functions to certain locations. In doing so, we modified and enhanced our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f as a result of and in connection
with the implementation of the new system and processes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we also launched a pilot deployment to one business at a location in Mexico. Additional implementations will occur to most locations of our company over a
multi-year period, with additional phases scheduled throughout fiscal 2009-2012. There have not been any other changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September30, 2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item9B.Other Information  None.
