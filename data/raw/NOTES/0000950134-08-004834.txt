period-to-period
comparisons of our consolidated financial results should not be
relied upon as an indication of future performance. The
operating results of many software companies reflect seasonal
trends, and our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be affected by such trends in the future. These
trends may include higher revenues in the fourth quarter as many
customers complete annual budgetary cycles and lower revenues in
the first quarter and summer months when many businesses
experience lower sales, particularly in the European market. For
additional factors that may impact our results of operations,
see PartI, Item1A. Risk Factors.   The consolidated financial statements required by this item are
submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report on
Form10-K.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in
Rule13a-15e
and
15d-15e
under the Exchange Act required by
Rule13a-15
of the Exchange Act under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e
and
15d-15e
under the Exchange Act as of December31, 2007.   The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
included a review of our processes and implementation and the
effect on the information generated for use in this Annual
Report on
Form10-K.
In the course of this evaluation, we sought to identify any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our
disclosure controls and procedures, to determine whether we had
identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a
significant role in our disclosure controls and procedures, and
to confirm that any necessary corrective action, including
process improvements, had been taken. This type of evaluation is
done every quarter so that our conclusions concerning the
effectiveness of these controls can be reported in the reports
we file or submit under the Exchange Act. The overall goals of
these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure
controls and procedures and to make modifications as necessary.
We intend to maintain these disclosure controls and procedures,
modifying them as circumstances warrant.   Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on
Form10-K.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable
assurance level to ensure that information we are required to
disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 iis recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and forms, and iiis
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to provide reasonable assurance that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management. Our disclosure
controls and procedures include components of our internal
control over financial reporting. Managements assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance
because a control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control
systems objectives will be met.   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined
in
Rule13a-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making
this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our
management has concluded that, as of December31, 2007, our
internal controls over financial reporting are effective to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principals. Our independent
registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP,
has audited the consolidated financial statements included in
this Annual Report on
Form10-K
and has issued its report on the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007.   
47 Table of Contents   Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting
will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within Interwoven have been detected.   Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three months ended December31, 2007
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on
Form10-K
are certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with
Rule13a-14
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This section
includes information concerning our internal control over
financial reporting and the evaluations referred to in those
certifications.  of this Annual Report on
Form10-K
sets forth the report of Ernst Young LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, regarding its
audit of our internal control over financial reporting set forth
below in this section.
