Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Williams Scotsman International,Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Williams Scotsman International,Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31,
2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at  a2. These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Williams Scotsman International,Inc. and subsidiaries at December31,
2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 2 lto the consolidated
financial statements, on January1, 2006 the Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No123 R, Share-Based
Payment, and changed its method of accounting for share-based
payments using the modified prospective transition method.
We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Williams
Scotsman International,Inc.s internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated March9, 2007 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

1. Organization and
Basis of Presentation
Williams Scotsman International,Inc. Holdings
or when including its subsidiaries, the Company was organized in
November1993 for the purpose of acquiring Williams Scotsman,Inc.
Scotsman. Holdings conducts business solely as a holding company, the only
significant assets of which are the capital stock of Scotsman, Williams
Scotsman Europe, S.L. WS Europe, and Williams Scotsman Mexico S. de R.L. de
C.V. WS Mexico. Therefore any cash dividends to be paid on Holdings common
stock, or cash interest to be paid on the debt of the Company are dependent
upon the cash flow of Scotsman, WS Europe, and WS Mexico.
The operations of the Company consist primarily of the
leasing and sale of mobile offices, modular buildings and storage products
equipment and their delivery and installation throughout the United States,
Canada, Spain, and Mexico.
The Company completed the acquisition of Wiron
Construccciones Modulares, S.A. Wiron on August18, 2006. The results
of Wirons operations have been included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements since August18, 2006. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
On May25, 2005, the
Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a
Certificate of Amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation. The amendment
changed the name of the Company from Scotsman Holdings,Inc. to Williams
Scotsman International,Inc.
2. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies
a Use of
Estimates
The preparation of the
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
b Principles of
Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and its 100% owned
subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
c Cash and Cash
Equivalents
The Company considers all
highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. Substantially all cash and cash equivalents
are invested in a money market investment account. These amounts are stated at
cost, which approximates market value.
d Fair Value of
Financial Instruments
Because of their
short-term nature, the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for
cash, receivables, the revolving credit facility and accounts payable
approximate fair value. The fair value of long-term debt is based on quoted
market prices. The fair market value and cost of the Companys long-term debt,
net were $660,297 and $619,464 at December31, 2006 and $505,449 and
$505,296 at December31, 2005. The Company does not have a significant
amount of credit risk associated with the fair  47 value of
its assets and liabilities. Prior to the Companys acquisition of 915% of the
common stock of Wiron during 2006, the Company owned an 85% minority interest.
This interest was not readily marketable and it was not practicable to estimate
the fair value at December31, 2005.
e Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Companys accounts
receivable consist of amounts due from customers throughout the United States,
Canada, Spain, and Mexico. Collateral is generally not required. The Company
provides for the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable through a charge to
operations in amounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred in
collection of the accounts. The estimated losses are based on historical
collection experience, days sales outstanding trends, and a review of specific
past due receivables. Customer accounts are written-off against the allowance
for doubtful accounts when an account is determined to be uncollectible.
f Leasing
Operations
Equipment is leased generally under operating leases
and, occasionally, under sales-type lease arrangements. Operating lease terms
generally range from 3months to 60months, and contractually
averaged approximately 16months at December31, 2006. Rents billed
in advance are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of
the operating leases. Rental equipment is depreciated by the straight-line
method using an estimated economic useful life of generally 20years and
an estimated residual value of typically 50% in North America and 10% in Spain.
Costs of improvements and
betterments are capitalized, whereas costs of replacement items, repairs and
maintenance are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for equipment to meet particular
lease specifications are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term.
However, costs aggregating less than $1 per unit are generally expensed as
incurred.
g Property and
Equipment
Property and equipment is
stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives ranging from 15 to 40years for buildings and
improvements, 3 to 10years for furniture and equipment, and 3 to 5 for
computer software. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
h Deferred
Financing Costs
Direct and incremental
costs of obtaining debt are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line
method, which approximates the effective interest rate method, over the term of
the related debt.
i Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the
cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill, but rather reviews its
carrying value for impairment annually, and whenever an impairment indicator is
identified.
The goodwill impairment
test involves a two-step approach. Under the first step, the Company determines
the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned. The
geographically based operating segments of the Company are the reporting units
for the impairment test. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting
unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company estimates the fair
values of its reporting units by utilizing market operating data multiples of
similar publicly traded companies, as well as its own. If the estimated fair
value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized. If the
carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill is considered  48 potentially
impaired and the second step is completed in order to measure the impairment
loss. Under the second step, the Company calculates the implied fair value of
goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets,
including any unrecognized intangible assets, of the reporting unit from the
fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step. The Company
then compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of
goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value
of goodwill, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference.
j Other
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist
principally of non-compete agreements and customer relationships acquired in
business combinations. These intangible assets are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from
24months to 216months. Amortization expense was approximately
$1,701 and $800 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The weighted-average remaining
life of these identified intangible assets is 79months.
k Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible
assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be
fully recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances may include a
significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or
changes in anticipated future cash flows. If an impairment indicator is
present, the Company evaluates recoverability by a comparison of the carrying
amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be
generated by the assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there
is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows
generated by other asset groups. If the assets are impaired, the impairment
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the
fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined by estimates of
discounted cash flows. The discount rate used in any estimate of discounted
cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk.
Assets
to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair values,
less estimated costs of disposal.
l Stock-based
Compensation
Effective
January1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123-R, Share-Based Payment SFAS No123-R,
using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition method,
compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes compensation cost for all
share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January1,
2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS No123, Stock-Based
Compensation. The adoption of SFAS No123-R did not have
a significant impact on the Companys financial position or its results of
operations. Prior to the Companys adoption of SFAS No123-R,
benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were
reported as operating cash flows. SFAS No123-R requires excess tax
benefits be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash
flow.
In applying the fair value accounting provisions of
SFAS No123-R, the Company uses a generally accepted option
valuation model, the Cox Rubenstein binomial valuation model. This model
requires specified inputs to determine the fair value of stock-based awards,
consisting of ithe fair value of the Companys common stock on the
grant date, iithe expected volatility of the Companys common stock
over the expected option life, iiithe risk-free interest rate, ivthe
expected dividend yield, and vthe expected option life. 49 An explanation of
these inputs is as follows Fair-Value
of Common StockPrior to issuing publicly
traded common stock in September2005, the Company
estimated the fair value of its common stock using valuations performed by an
experienced investor in the Company. Subsequent to September2005, the
date the Company first issued publicly-traded common stock, the Company uses
the opening quoted market price of its common stock on the grant date.
VolatilityA measure of the
amount by which the share price is expected to fluctuate over a period
commensurate with the expected life of the award. Because of limited or no
historical information regarding its own historical stock volatility during the
financial statement periods, the Company considered the expected volatility of
similar entities in developing this input. In selecting guideline companies,
the Company considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle, size, and
financial leverage.
Risk-Free
Interest RateAn assumption to take into account,
among other things, the time value of money. The risk-free interest rate is the
implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining
term equal to the expected life of the award at the grant date.
Dividend
YieldDividends paid on the underlying
common stock will impact an awards value. The Company has never declared or
paid dividends and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
Expected
Life of Stock-based AwardsThe period of time for
which the stock-based award is expected to be outstanding, or the period of
time from the service inception date to the date of expected exercise or other
expected settlement. Prior to issuing publicly-traded common stock in
September2005, the Company estimated the expected life of awards
considering the estimated dates of liquidity events likely to be triggered by
the Companys private equity investors. Upon the adoption of SFAS No123-R
in 2006, the Company adopted a temporary shortcut approach allowed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission to develop the estimate of the expected term
of awards. Under this approach, the expected term is presumed to be the
mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. This
shortcut approach is not permitted for options granted, modified or settled
after December31, 2007.
The weighted-average fair value of options granted in
2006, 2005, and 2004 were $1122, $759, and $511, respectively. The following

Gross compensation cost
recognized related to stock-based compensation for the year ended
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
$2,657, $3,756 and $736, respectively. During 2005, the Company recorded
$2,387 of stock compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of
options as a result of the Companys initial public offering. During 2004, a
modification was made for the continuation of certain employees options after
their termination from the Company. The weighted-average fair value of their modified
options, risk free interest rate at the modification date, expected life and
volatility as estimated based upon a historical average of comparable stock
indices was $793, 278%, 311years, and 399% for 2004. 50 m Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the
year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in net income in the period that includes the enactment
date.
n Advertising
costs
Advertising costs are
generally expensed as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended
December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $4,638, $4,622, and $4,345,
respectively, and is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses
in the consolidated statements of operations.

2005 and 2004, respectively, due to their anti-dilutive nature, which resulted
from the Companys net loss for such periods.
p Revenue Recognition
The Company earns revenue from leasing, sales of new
and used rental equipment, and delivery and installation services. Where
applicable, the Companys revenue recognition policy takes into consideration
the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.
Revenue from delivery and installation services
associated with rental activities is generally recognized upon their
completion, as the Company has objective evidence of the fair value of the
remaining equipment leasing element of the arrangements. This evidence consists
of rental rates associated with units leased without corresponding delivery and
installation services. Leasing revenue is recognized ratably over the lease
term. Billings in excess of earned revenue is recorded as deferred revenue in
the balance sheet caption, rents billed in advance.
Revenue from the sale of new units and used rental
equipment, including delivery and installation revenue, is generally recognized
at the time the units are installed. Certain arrangements to sell units under
long-term construction-type sales contracts are recognized under the percentage
of completion method. Under this method, income is recognized in proportion to
the incurred costs to date under the contract compared to estimated total
costs.
Sales of new units are typically covered by warranties
provided by the manufacturer of products sold. The Company provides a limited
30-day warranty for certain sales of rental equipment. The Companys
warranty expense is estimated and accrued at the time of sale. Warranty expense
was not material for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. 51 Other revenue consists
principally of revenue from the rental or sale of ancillary items associated with
the rental or sale of related equipment. These items typically consist of
steps, ramps and other products, insurance waivers and other miscellaneous
revenue. If these items are associated with equipment under operating leases,
revenue is recognized over the related lease term. Otherwise, revenue is
recognized when the item is delivered or the service is performed.
q Hedging
Activities
The Company utilizes foreign currency hedging
instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations
in exchange rates underlying the value of an intercompany note denominated in a
foreign currency. The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments
foreign currency forward contract in accordance with SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities SFAS No133. The forward contract the Company
holds is designated as a cash flow hedge and therefore, the effective portions
of changes in the fair value of this derivative is recorded in other
comprehensive income OCI, and the ineffective portion is recognized in
earnings. To date, the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of
derivatives have not been material.
r Foreign
Currency Translation
The financial statements
of the Companys foreign subsidiaries for which the local currency is the
functional currency have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance SFAS
No52, Foreign Currency Translation.
Assets and liabilities have been translated using the exchange rate in effect
at the balance sheet date. Income statement amounts have been translated using
the average exchange rates during the year. Translation gains and losses
resulting from the changes in exchange rates from year-to-year have been
reported in other comprehensive income. The effect on the consolidated
statements of operations of all transaction gains and losses was $600, $0 and
$0 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
s Operating
Segments
The Company manages its operations on a geographic
basis. Financial results of geographic regions are aggregated into one
reportable segment since their operations have similar economic
characteristics. These characteristics include similar products and services,
processes for delivering these services, type or class of customer, and
long-term average gross margins.
t Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In September2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.SAB 108 which
provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal
of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year
misstatement. The guidance is applicable for fiscal years ending after
November15, 2006, or December31, 2006 for the Company. The guidance
had no effect on the Companys financial statements.
In June2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued Interpretation 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes FIN 48, an interpretation of SFAS No109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a consistent recognition threshold
and measurement attribute, as well as criteria for subsequently recognizing,
derecognizing and measuring tax positions for financial statement purposes. The
interpretation also requires expanded disclosure of uncertain tax positions.
The interpretation is effective for the Company on January1, 2007. The
Company does not anticipate that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material
impact on its financial position or results of operations. 52 In September2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair
Value Measurements SFAS No157. SFAS No157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally
accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS No157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based
measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and states that a fair value
measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. This Statement
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements, the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting
pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute.
Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements.
SFAS No157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007, and the Company intends to adopt the standard on
January1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any,
that SFAS No157 will have on its financial position, results of
operations and cash flows, but does not believe the effect will be material.
u Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The effect
of these reclassifications is not material to the consolidated financial
statements.
3. Acquisitions
Acquisition of
Wiron Construcciones Modulares, SA
On August18, 2006, the Company acquired a 915%
interest in Wiron Construcciones Modulares, S.A. Wiron for approximately
$53,100.
The purchase price was primarily financed with cash
borrowed from the Companys amended and restated credit facility. In addition,
the Company repaid certain shareholder debt in the transaction approximating
$3,400. The purchase price includes approximately $7,700 of funds that are
subject to bank guarantee agreements pending the resolution of certain
pre-acquisition contingencies. To the extent these contingencies are resolved
in favor of the Sellers, these funds will be released to the Sellers. If the
contingent liabilities are satisfied by the Company, the funds will be
recovered from the bank.
Wiron is headquartered in Parla, Spain and is one of
the largest modular space providers in Spain with 14 branch locations. Wiron
manufactures and leases mobile offices and had a lease fleet at acquisition of
approximately 14,000 units. With the Companys acquisition in July2004 of
an 85% minority interest for approximately $4,700, the Company now owns 100%
of the share capital of Wiron. 53 The
following table presents the preliminary allocation of purchase price related
to the Wiron business as of the date of acquisition. The allocation of the
purchase price is based on preliminary estimates, subject to revision, after
the tax basis of assets has been finalized. Any revisions to the allocation
will be reported as changes to various assets and liabilities including
goodwill and other intangible assets

The intangible assets are amortized using the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives. The purchase price allocation
resulted in the recognition of approximately $6,100 of goodwill. Total goodwill
as a result of the acquisition of an 85% minority interest in July2004
and this acquisition was $10,320. This goodwill is a result of the value of the
assembled workforce acquired and the ability to earn a higher rate of return
from the acquired business than would be expected if those net assets had to be
acquired or developed separately. Management believes the goodwill recorded as
a result of this acquisition will be deductible for income tax purposes;
however, management is still making a final determination of the tax basis of
the assets. 54 The
following table provides pro forma results of operations for the year ended
December31, 2006 and 2005 as if Wiron had been acquired as of the
beginning of each period presented. The pro forma results include certain
purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation
and amortization expense on acquired tangible and intangible assets as well as
interest expense on borrowings used to finance the acquisition. However, pro
forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of
the planned integration of Wiron. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily
indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisition had occurred
on the dates indicated or that may result in the future.

Acquisition of
American Homes Internacional, S.A. de C.V.
On February17, 2006,
the Company acquired American Homes Internacional, S.A. de C.V., a Monterrey,
Mexico-based company that leased and sold mobile office units. This purchase
resulted in the acquisition of approximately 300 units and the related customer
base. The transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
with a purchase price of $5,100. The excess purchase price over the estimated
fair value of the net tangible assets purchased was $2,400. The purchase price
was financed with cash borrowed from the Companys credit facility.
Acquisition of
Mobile Space Inc.
On February24, 2005,
the Company acquired Mobile Space Inc., a Chicago-based company that leased and
sold modular space units. This purchase resulted in the acquisition of
approximately 640 units and the related customer base. The transaction was
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with a purchase price of $4,800,
of which approximately $710 was recorded as goodwill. The acquisition was
financed with borrowings under the Companys credit facility.
Purchase of
California Classroom Units
On March26, 2004,
the Company acquired nearly 3,800 relocatable Division of State Architect
classroom units located in the state of California from Transport International
Pool,Inc. d/b/a GE Modular Space for approximately $43,500. The assets
were acquired using available funds under the Companys revolving credit facility.
The acquisition included the purchase of units, equipment associated with these
classroom units as well as rights under all outstanding leases related to these
classroom units and certain other assets. The Company did not acquire
employees, physical facilities, sales force, or other business related items.
In addition, the customer base, which is primarily related to public and
private educational institutions in the State of California, is similar to, and
in many cases duplicative of, the Companys existing customer base. As a
result, the Company considers the purchase of these assets an asset purchase
rather than an acquisition of a business. 55 4. Property and

On June28, 2005, the Company entered into an
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the net proceeds of which were used to
refinance the then existing credit agreement. The amended and restated credit
facility provides for a $500,000 revolving credit facility and a $150,000 term
loan, both maturing on June28, 2010. Interest on borrowings under the
revolver and term loan is payable at a rate of either prime plus 1% or the
Eurodollar rate plus 25%. The interest rate margin is subject to pricing
adjustments based on excess availability and a ratio defined in the credit
agreement. In connection with the refinancing, approximately $5,200 of deferred
financing costs related to the prior credit facility were expensed immediately
and included in loss on early extinguishment of debt. The weighted-average
interest rates of the revolver under the credit agreement were 689% and 637%
at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The weighted-average interest
rates of the term loan under the credit agreement were 685% and 664% at
December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
On April12, 2006, Scotsman entered into an
amendment to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The amendment extended
the maturity of the Amended and Restated Credit Facility to April12,
2011, provided for more favorable borrowing base calculations, revised the
restrictive covenants to grant greater flexibility to incur debt and make
acquisitions, and revised the change of control provisions. In addition, the
amendment changed the interest rate on borrowings under the revolver and term
loan from a rate of either prime plus 1% or the Eurodollar rate plus 25% to
either prime plus 050% or the Eurodollar rate plus 20%. The interest rate
margin is also subject to pricing adjustments based on excess availability and
a ratio of total funded debt to EBITDA as defined in the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement.
On November10, 2006, the Company entered into a
second amendment to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to further revise
the definition of change of control. A change of control is an event of default
under the credit agreement. The amendment eliminates the requirement that the
Equity Investors,  57 including related parties
of The Cypress Group L.L.C. and Keystone Group, L.P., as more specifically
defined in the credit agreement, retain a minimum ownership percentage of
Holdings capital stock. Instead the amendment provides that it is a change of
control if 25% or more of the economic or voting interest in Holdings capital
stock is acquired on a fully diluted
basis, by any person or group, other than the Equity Investors.
The total commitment under the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement including the term loan and revolver facility was $650,000
at December31, 2006. Borrowings under this facility, which are based upon
a borrowing base calculation, are secured by a first priority lien on and
security interest in rental equipment, accounts receivable, property and
equipment and other assets. The credit facility contains affirmative and
negative covenants customary for such financings including restrictions on the
amount of dividends that Scotsman and its subsidiaries can pay to Holdings. In
addition, if Scotsman does not meet certain excess availability requirements,
the Company will be required to comply with a senior secured leverage ratio, a
consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum utilization test. During the
year ended December31, 2006, Scotsman met the excess availability
requirements and did not have to comply with the financial covenants. Excess
availability calculated in accordance with the credit agreement under this
facility was approximately $205,500 at December31, 2006.
On September29, 2005, Scotsman issued $350,000
of 85% Senior Notes due 2015 the 85% Notes. The Company used the net
proceeds of approximately $340,900 received from this offering together with
the proceeds from the Companys initial public offering and the borrowings
under the amended and restated credit facility to repurchase or redeem the
9875% Notes due 2007 9875% Notes and repurchase $148,200 of the 100% Notes
due 2008 100% Notes. The repurchase or redemption of the 9875% and 100%
Notes together, the Notes was conducted through a tender offer and consent
solicitation whereby the Company offered to purchase all outstanding 100%
Notes at a cash price of 109522% of the aggregate principal amount of such
notes and all outstanding 9875% Notes at a cash purchase price of 1005% of
the aggregate principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
In connection with the tender offer of the Notes, the Company purchased the
9875% Notes and $148,200 of the 10% Notes. In connection with the debt
extinguishment, $30,678 in deferred financing fees and premium costs related to
the tender offer and the extinguished debt were expensed and included in loss
on early extinguishment of debt. Also, on April18, 2006, Scotsman issued
$100,000 of additional 85% Senior Notes due 2015 the 85% Notes at a cash
price of 10175% of their principal amount. The Company used the proceeds to
repay a portion of its indebtedness under the revolver portion of the Amended
and Restated Credit Facility and pay related fees and expenses.
The 85% Notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Holdings and certain subsidiaries of
Scotsman. Willscot has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 85% Notes on a
subordinated basis. None of the foreign subsidiaries of Scotsman other than
its Canadian subsidiary guarantee the notes. The 85% Notes are due on October1,
2015, with interest payable semi-annually on April1 and October1 of
each year. On October1, 2010, the 85% Notes will become redeemable at
the option of the Company, at a redemption price of 10425% during the 12 month
period beginning October1, 2010, declining to 1000% during the 12 month
period beginning October1, 2013 and thereafter.
In connection with the acquisition of Wiron, the
Company assumed debt. Wirons debt was primarily acquired to finance the
purchase of rental equipment and other property and equipment as well as
support operating activities. As of December31, 2006, total debt
outstanding of Wiron was $35,505, including revolving credit agreements
totaling $21,874 that expire within one year, with average interest rates of
40%, as well as capital lease obligations. These amounts are included in the
debt balances above. 58 Letter of credit
obligations at December31, 2006 and 2005 were approximately $19,514 and
$20,464, respectively. Maturities of debt during the years subsequent to
December31, 2006 are $27,003 in 2007, $6,099 in 2008, $3,691 in 2009 2,538 in 2010, $425,777 in 2011, and $451,248 thereafter.
7. Hedging
Activities
The Company operates in various countries, and its
earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency
exchange rates. The Company addresses these risks through a risk management
program that may include the use of derivative financial instruments. The
Company does not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative
purposes.
During December, 2006, the Company entered into a
foreign currency forward contract to manage its currency transaction exposure
for an intercompany receivable which arose from the acquisition of Wiron see
Note 3 with a notional amount of EUR 20 million. This intercompany receivable
is expected to be repaid during 2007. This currency forward contract is
designated as a cash flow hedge under SFAS No133 and, therefore, the
effective portions of changes in the fair value of this derivative is recorded
in other comprehensive income OCI, and the ineffective portion is
recognized in earnings.
To date, the ineffective portions of changes in the
fair value of derivatives have not been material. The Company did not enter into any derivative
contracts designated as cash flow hedges in 2005 or 2004. Transaction gains,
which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations, were not material for the
three years ended December31, 2006.
8. Stockholders
Equity
On May16,
2006, the Company and selling shareholders sold 9,990,793 shares of its common
stock at $2625 per share. Of the shares, 2,101,724 shares were sold by the
Company and resulted in proceeds to the Company of approximately $51,526 net
of underwriting fees and other offering expenses of approximately $3,550. In
addition, 7,889,069 shares were offered by selling stockholders of the Company,
which include related parties of The Cypress Group L.L.C. and Keystone Group,
L.P. and certain members of senior management. Also, 380,000 stock options were
exercised and the shares were sold by management in connection with this
offering, which resulted in additional net proceeds to the Company of
$2,000. The Company used its proceeds
from this stock offering to repay a portion of its indebtedness under the
revolver portion of the Amended and Restated Credit Facility and pay related
fees and expenses.
On
September23, 2005, the Company completed an initial public offering of
14,705,882 shares of common stock. Further, on October18, 2005,
the underwriters exercised over-allotment options to purchase 400,000 shares of
the Companys common stock. Total
proceeds of the initial public offering and over-allotment options was
$223,092 net of underwriting fees and
other offering expenses of $18,602. In addition, in connection with the
initial public offering, 454,365 stock options were exercised by management of
the Company and sold, resulting in additional net proceeds to the Company of
$945. The Company recorded an excess income tax benefit of approximately
$2,300 related to the exercise of these stock options as additional paid-in
capital. Proceeds of the initial public
offering were used to reduce debt. 59 9. Income Taxes

At December31, 2006, the Company had net
operating loss carryovers available for federal and foreign income tax purposes
of approximately $221,000. These net operating loss carryovers expire at
various dates from 2008 to 2024.
Net operating losses in the amount of $7,800 and $371
expired in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Valuation allowances of $2,258 related
to U.S. and Mexico net operating loss carryovers were reversed in 2006 based on
changes in estimates regarding the ability of the Company to use these loss
carryovers to reduce future taxable income. A valuation allowance of $862 is
recorded based on the assessment that certain net operating loss carryovers in
Spain are not currently expected to be realized.
Alternative minimum tax credit carryovers of
approximately $2,459 are available without expiration limitations. 60 Income

During 2006, income tax decreased by $1,032 related to
changes in the estimated future effects of income taxes on cumulative temporary
differences resulting from recent changes to enacted tax rates for Canada and
certain of its provinces. During 2004, the income tax expense increased by
$2,549 related to a change in the estimate of the future effects of state
income taxes on cumulative temporary differences, resulting from a change in
the estimated income apportionment among states in which the Company does
business.

Deferred U.S. income taxes
have not been recorded for basis differences related to investments in foreign
subsidiaries. These basis differences were approximately $281 million at
December31, 2006 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings. Those
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S.
federal and state income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of
those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be
subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax
credits and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign  61 countries.
Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings
is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on
circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.
10. Commitments and
Contingencies
The
Company is obligated under noncancelable leases for certain equipment, vehicles
and parcels of land. At December31, 2006 approximate future minimum

Rent expense was $13,708 in 2006, $13,555 in 2005, and
$12,869 in 2004.
The Company maintains insurance coverage for its
operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and
deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines is necessary or prudent
based upon current operations and historical experience. The majority of these
coverages have large deductible amounts which allow for potential improved cash
flow benefits based on the Companys loss control efforts. The current per
incident deductibles are $125 for employee group health insurance and $500 for
workers compensation, auto, and general liability.
The Company expenses the deductible portion of the
individual claims. However, the Company generally does not know the full amount
of its exposure to a deductible in connection with any particular claim during
the fiscal period in which the claim is incurred and for which the Company must
make an accrual for the deductible expense. The Company makes these accruals
based on a combination of the claims review by its staff and insurance
companies, and, periodically, the accrual is reviewed and adjusted based on the
Companys loss experience. A high degree of judgment is required in developing
these estimates of amounts to be accrued, as well as in connection with the
underlying assumptions. In addition, the Companys assumptions will change as
its loss experience is developed. All of these factors have the potential for
significantly impacting the amounts the Company has previously reserved in
respect of anticipated deductible expenses, and the Company may be required in
the future to increase or decrease amounts previously accrued.
Currently, the Company is
involved in various lawsuits and claims arising out of the normal course of its
business. The nature of the Companys business is such that disputes
occasionally arise with vendors, including suppliers and subcontractors, and
customers over warranties, contract specifications and contract interpretations
among other things. The Company assesses these matters on a case-by-case basis
as they arise. Reserves are established, as required, based on the Companys
assessment of its exposure. As noted above, the Company has insurance policies
to cover general liability and workers compensation related claims. In the
opinion of management, the ultimate amount of liability not covered by
insurance, if any, under pending litigation and claims will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company. 62 11. Employee
Benefit Plans
Defined
contribution plan. The
Company has adopted a defined contribution plan the 401kPlan which is
intended to satisfy the tax qualification requirements of Sections 401a,
401k, and 401mof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 the Code. The
401kPlan covers substantially all employees and permits participants to
contribute up to the dollar limit described in Section402gof the
Code $15 in 2006. All amounts deferred under this salary reduction feature
are fully vested. In accordance with the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of
2001, the Plan also allows employees over the age of 50 to contribute an
additional $5 as a catch-up contribution.
The 401kPlan has a matching contribution
feature under which the Company may contribute a percentage of the amount deferred
by each participant, excluding the catch-up contribution. Such percentage, if
any, is determined by Company management at its discretion. The Plan also has a
discretionary profit sharing feature, under which the Company may contribute,
at its discretion, an additional amount allocable to the accounts of active
participants meeting the aforementioned eligibility requirements. Company
contributions to the 401kPlan participant vest ratably during the first
five years of a participants employment and 100% thereafter. Matching
contributions by the Company to the 401kPlan were $671 in 2006, $582 in
2005, and $315 in 2004. No contributions were made by the Company under the
profit-sharing feature for the years ended December31, 2005 or 2004.
During 2006, $633 of contributions were made by the Company under the
profit-sharing feature.
Deferred
compensation plan. The
Company has adopted a Deferred Compensation Plan for Executives which is meant
to be an unfunded deferred compensation plan maintained for a select group of
management within the meaning of Sections 2012, 301a3and
401a1of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. This
plan allows key employees to defer a specified amount of their compensation
until termination or upon the occurrence of other specified events. All amounts
credited to participants accounts are deemed invested in the investment
vehicles of the employees choice. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, the
total amount deferred under this plan, including earnings, was approximately
$481 and $321, respectively.
Restricted
Stock Units. The
Company awards members of its board of directors restricted stock units RSU. The RSU awards granted prior
to June30, 2006 fully vest in six months from the award date, and were
settled at that time in shares of the Companys common stock. The shares
received in respect of the RSU awards cannot be sold or transferred until one
year after the recipient has ceased to serve as a director of the Company. RSU awards granted after June30, 2006
fully vest in six months from the award date, and become available for
settlement in shares of the Companys common stock at the earliest of
ithe recipients death, ii, a change in control, or iiione
year after the recipient has ceased to serve as a director of the Company. For
the year ended December31, 2006, 14,668 restricted stock units were
granted at a weighted-average grant price of $2147 per share and remain
unvested at December31, 2006. For the year ended December31, 2005,
16,872 restricted stock units were granted at a weighted-average grant price of
$1604 per share and are vested at December31, 2006. The Company has
recorded approximately $293 and $113 of stock compensation related to these
awards for the year ended December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of
December31, 2006, there are 14,668 unvested RSUs.
Stock
options. The
Company has adopted stock option plans for certain key employees of the
Company. In 2005, the Company adopted the 2005 Employee Stock Option Plan the
2005 Plan which allowed for up to 18 million options to be granted. In 2003
the Company adopted the 2003 Employee Stock Option Plan the 2003 plan which
allowed for up to 874,690 options to be granted. Under the 1997 Employee Stock
Option Plan the 1997 Plan, up to 1,823,538 options to purchase the
Companys outstanding common stock could be granted. Prior to the Companys
recapitalization in 1997, the Company had adopted the 1994 Employee Stock
Option Plan the 1994 plan for
certain key employees. All options outstanding under the 2003 Plan and 1997
Plan eligible for vesting became fully vested in  63 conjunction with the
Companys 2005 initial public offering. As a result of this accelerated
vesting, the Company recorded approximately $2,400 of additional stock
compensation for the year ended December31, 2005.
The options under the Stock Option Plans are granted
with an exercise price equal to the estimated fair value of the shares as of
the date of grant. All
options issued under plans, other than the Companys 2005 Omnibus Award Plan,
are vested. Under the Companys 2005 Plan, nonqualified stock options have been
granted to officers and employees. One half of employee stock options vest over
four years and expire ten years from the date of grant. The other half of these
options vest over four years, contingent upon certain performance goals of the
Company being met. All options expire 10years from the date of
grant.

Damage and Recovery
During the third quarter of 2004, approximately 500
mobile office and storage units, the majority of which were not on rent, with a
book value of approximately $3,400 were destroyed as a result of several
hurricanes the 2004 Hurricanes experienced in the southeast region of the
United States. In addition, approximately 200 units as well as certain other
Company assets were damaged. The total costs related to these storms
approximated $4,600. During 2005, the Company settled with its insurance
companies for approximately $8,600 to cover losses from these storms, of which
$5,000 was received as of December31, 2004 and the remainder during 2005.
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded in other revenues approximately
$3,300, representing the realized gain from the involuntary conversion of these
assets lost in the 2004 Hurricanes. In addition, during the third quarter of
2005, the Company reduced the amount of losses accrued for damage to rental
units from the 2004 Hurricanes by approximately $700 as a result of a final
settlement with insurers.
During the third quarter
of 2005, certain of the Companys assets were damaged or destroyed as a result
of hurricanes the 2005 Hurricanes experienced in the southern region of the
U.S. The Companys losses were primarily related to units on rent, for which
rental customers have elected the Companys insurance waiver program, and
damages to other company assets. The Company self-insures units under the
waiver program. Based on the Companys assessment of the damages, approximately
200 units have been either damaged or destroyed as a result of the hurricanes
for which some portion of the damage was not recoverable from either the
customer or through insurance. Based on the Companys assessment of its
probable loss, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $1,700 in
September2005. As noted above, during the third quarter of 2005, the
Company reduced the amount of losses accrued for damage to rental units from
2004 Hurricanes by approximately $700 as a result of a final settlement with
insurers. The net charge of $1,000 was recorded in other expenses.

Events
On March9, 2007, Scotsman entered into an
amendment to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Under the amendment, WS
Canada was released as a guarantor under the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, and WS Canadas pledge of its assets was terminated. In addition,
the amendment provides that Scotsmans pledge of WS Canadas stock will be
reduced to 65% from 100%. As a result of the release of WS Canada from its guarantee
under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, its guarantee under the 85%
Notes indenture was also released.
On March8, 2007, the Company acquired the assets
of Honolulu-based Hawaii Modular Space,Inc., and its sister company,
Alaska Modular Space,Inc. for a purchase price of $425 million and
additional payments totaling $30 million, subject to the acquired companies
achieving certain financial targets. Hawaii Modular operates three branch
locations across state, while Alaska Modular manages operations based in
Anchorage. The purchased assets include 1,300 units consisting of mobile
offices, storage containers, classrooms and custom modular buildings and the
related customer base. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the
Companys Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 70 Item 1.

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and
with the participation of Corporations management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Corporation evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporations disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15eand 15d-15eunder
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act as of
December31, 2006. Based upon that evaluation, the Corporations Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporations
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Corporations
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15fand
15d-15fof the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
participation of Corporations management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Corporation evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, the
Corporations Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Corporations internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December31, 2006.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING
There were no changes in the Corporations internal
controls over financial reporting for the year ended December31, 2006
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Corporations internal control over financial reporting.
It should be noted that any system of controls,
however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition,
the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent
limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that our
controls will succeed in achieving their stated goals under all potential
future conditions.
Ernst Young
LLP, the Corporations independent registered public accounting firm, audited
managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting and, based on that audit, issued the report set forth below. 71 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Williams Scotsman International,Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, that Williams Scotsman International,Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based
on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO
criteria. Williams Scotsman International,Inc.s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that Williams
Scotsman International,Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Williams
Scotsman International,Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2006, based on the COSO criteria.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Williams Scotsman International,Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006, and our
report dated March9, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP
