We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Journal Register Company as of December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Journal Register Company at December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

43 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Journal Register Company
We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that Journal Register Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Journal Register Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on ma
nagements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that Journal Register Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Journal Register Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss and cash flows for the years then ended of Journal Register Company and our report dated March 16, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

49 JOURNAL REGISTER COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.Organization
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include Journal Register Company JRC and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries the Company. The Company primarily publishes, in print and online, daily and non-daily newspapers serving markets in Philadelphia and its surrounding areas, Michigan, Connecticut, the Greater Cleveland area of Ohio, New England, and the Capital-Saratoga and Mid-Hudson regions of New York. The Company owns and manages commercial printing operations in Connecticut and Pennsylvania. The Company also owns JobsInTheUS, a network of 19 premier employment Web sites throughout the eastern United States of America. The Company was incorporated on March 
11, 1997 and became a publicly traded company in May of 1997.
The Company has authorized 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, none of which were issued or outstanding during the periods presented.
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Fiscal Year
The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday, closest to the end of the calendar year. The Companys 2006 fiscal year ended on December 31, 2006 and encompassed a 53-week period. The Companys 2005 and 2004 fiscal years encompassed 52-week periods and ended on December 25 and December 26, respectively.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JRC and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany activity transactions and profits.
Segment Reporting
The Company is primarily engaged in the publishing of daily and non-daily newspapers in print and online in the United States of America. Newspapers are typically distributed through local distribution channels, which consist primarily of contract carriers, single copy outlets and through the world wide web. The Company considers its business to be one operating segment. This operating segment consists of several geographically diverse operating units, which are locally managed, but are aggregated into one segment because each of our units is engaged in the same essential business activity in each local market served. The combined operating units have similar economic characteristics based on similar products, services, customers,
production processes and distribution systems. The Company believes this presentation of our financial condition and performance is consistent with the way in which our operations are managed.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, investments, remaining useful lives of long-lived assets, impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, as well as contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its judgments about estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and l
iabilities and disclosure of contingent matters on historical experience, actuarial studies and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
50 JOURNAL REGISTER COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policiescontinued Concentration of Credit Risk
In 2006, no single customer accounted for more than one percent of total revenues or two percent of accounts receivable. Approximately 17 percent of the Companys employees were employed under collective bargaining agreements at December 31, 2006. The Company anticipates that collective bargaining agreements at 7 newspapers, representing approximately 65 percent of the employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, will be renegotiated in 2007.
Critical Accounting Policies
Critical accounting policies for the Company involve its assessment of the recoverability of its long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, which are based on such factors as estimated future cash flows and current fair value estimates of its operations. The Companys accounting for pension and retiree medical benefits requires the use of various estimates concerning the work force, interest rates, plan investment return, and involves the use of advice from consulting actuaries. The Companys accounting for income taxes is sensitive to interpretation of various laws and regulations therein, and to Company policy and determination as to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards availabl
e to offset the Companys future consolidated taxable income.
In addition to the Companys critical accounting policies, the remaining part of this footnote is devoted to the specifics of the Companys significant policies.
Reclassifications
The Companys Form 8-K and earnings release dated February 7, 2007 reflected the charge for a write-down of goodwill as a reduction in income/loss from continuing operations, but not as a reduction of operating income. The Consolidated Statements of Operations contained herein includes the write down of goodwill as a component of operating income. Consequently, the operating income numbers for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2006 presented in the February 7, 2006 8-K containing the Companys Press Release entitled Journal Register Company Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2006 Results differs from the operating income listed in this report. The
re are no changes to income from continuing operations, discontinued operations or net income loss, or net income loss per share.
In 2005, certain balance sheet, circulation revenue and expense items were reclassified for all years presented. The reclassifications had no effect on working capital, net income or earnings per share. The 2006 items have been presented consistent with the changes made in 2005. Certain items presented in the cash flows statement have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
Discontinued Operations
As a result of the sale of the New England newspaper properties, more fully discussed in Note 10, the Companys previously reported financial statements for 2005 and 2004 have been revised to present the New England newspaper operations as discontinued operations separate from continuing operations of the Company. Results of discontinued operations include an allocation of interest based on a ratio of net assets of the discontinued operations to the total consolidated net assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At times throughout the year, the Companys deposits in banks may exceed the federal depository insurance limitation amount. The Company does the majority of its banking with large money center banks.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to the Company from normal business activities. The Company does not accrue interest on its accounts receivable and collateral is not required 
51 JOURNAL REGISTER COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policiescontinued from its customers. Allowances for doubtful accounts provide for the estimated loss because of the inability to collect required payments from customers. The Company uses historical collection experience as well as current market information in determining this estimate. The Company determines the status of customer payments based on days past due its normal trade terms or on contractual terms. The Company writes-off accounts receivable, which are deemed uncollectible after all collection efforts are exhausted, on a specific identification basis. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Credit losses have generally been within managements expectations.
Inventories
Inventories, consisting of newsprint, ink and supplies, are stated at the lower of cost primarily on the first-in, first-out method or market.
Property and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less impairment, if any. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while costs of major additions and betterments are capitalized. The Company capitalizes interest costs as part of the cost of constructing major facilities and equipment. Depreciation is primarily provided for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives Buildings and improvements 2 to 30 years Machinery and equipment 2 to 30 years Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company reviews the recoverability of intangibles and other long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are only recognized when the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is not recoverable. Recoverability is determined when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset. If it is determin
ed that the carrying amount is not recoverable, an impairment loss is measured through use of estimates for future market growth, forecasted revenue and costs, remaining useful life and appropriate discount rates. The carrying amount of the long-lived asset is reduced by the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value with a corresponding charge to expense.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of publications or businesses generally consist of the values assigned to subscriber lists, mastheads, non-competition covenants and the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of the publications or businesses acquired and deferred financing costs. Intangible assets, excluding goodwill and mastheads, are being amortized using the straight-line method over a period of their useful life generally 3 to 15 years.
Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 SFAS 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually, or more frequently if required, for impairment. For purposes of accounting for its indefinite lived intangibles, the Company has established reporting units at a level below the operating segment level. These reporting units consist principally of the aggregated newspaper print and online operations within six regional groups and the 
52 JOURNAL REGISTER COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policiescontinued JobsInTheUS business. This asset impairment review assesses the fair value of assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected form the disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset. This approach uses estimates for future market growth, forecasted revenue and costs, expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates. Changes to these estimates, including the inability to attain forecasted revenue and cost expectations, could result in the recognition of a future impairment loss.
Investments
Investments in non-public businesses in which the Company does not have control or does not exert significant influence are carried at cost. Gains and losses resulting from periodic evaluations of the carrying value of these investments are included as a non-operating expense.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes, SFAS 109. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when realization is not considered to be more likely than not.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is earned from the sale of advertising, circulation and commercial printing. Advertising revenues are recognized, net of agency discounts, in the period when advertising is printed in the Companys publications or placed on the Companys Web sites. Circulation revenues, net of discounts, are recognized when purchased newspapers are distributed. Amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilities. Amounts charged for the Companys newspapers vary among the Companys newspapers and depend on the type of sale, such as subscription or single copy and distributor arrangements.
In 2005, the Company reclassified certain circulation revenues and expenses related to discounts, promotions and carrier compensation in equal amounts, reflecting a change in the reporting of certain of the Companys carrier compensation and certain discount and promotional items from prior years. The impact was a decrease in circulation revenues offset entirely by a decrease in operating expenses. This reclassification has no impact on operating income, income before taxes, or net income. In fiscal years 2005 and 2004, the impact on circulation revenues was $41 million and $66 million, respectively.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Retirement Plans
Pension costs under the Companys retirement plans are actuarially determined. The Companys policy is to fund costs accrued under the qualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The Company recognizes the cost of post retirement medical benefits on an accrual basis over the working lives of employees expected to receive such benefits.
Accounting for Share-Based Payments
The Company adopted SFAS No123R Accounting for Share-Based PaymentSFAS 123R, as of the beginning of fiscal 2006 using the modified prospective method. This statement addressed the 
53 JOURNAL REGISTER COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policiescontinued accounting for share-based payment transactions and requires all share-based payment to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values. It requires that share based payments be accounted for using a fair value based method to recognize compensation expense. It also requires that the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as was required under previous accounting pronouncements.
There was no effect on income before continuing operations, income before taxes, net income, cash flow from operations, cash flow from financing activities and on basic and diluted earnings per share on the adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006. The standard requires that for years presented in which there were unvested options that pro forma disclosures of the impact be presented See Note 5.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company followed the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based employee compensation. Under APB 25, no compensation expense was recognized because the exercise price of employee stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant.
On October 27, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested outstanding stock options to October 27, 2005. In total the vesting of 1,445,960 outstanding stock options was accelerated. These stock options were awarded under the Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan Amended and Restated. All other terms and conditions of such outstanding stock options remain applicable. Generally these options were scheduled to vest annually over 5 years beginning on the first anniversary of their grant date.
Derivative Risk Management Policy and Strategy
In accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to maintain certain Interest Rate Protection Agreements IRPAs on a portion of its debt, to reduce the potential exposure of the Companys future cash flows to fluctuation in variable interest rates on which the interest of the outstanding debt is calculated. The minimum requirement varies depending on the Companys Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. From time to time, the Company may enter into additional IRPAs for nominal amounts on the outstanding debt that will, at a minimum, meet the requirements of the Credit Agreement. Each IRPA is designated for all or a portion of the princip
al balance and term of a specific debt obligation.
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 137 and No. 138, specifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for interest rate derivatives. In accordance with these pronouncements, all effective hedges, as defined, are recorded as an asset or liability with a corresponding offset to Other Comprehensive Income OCI in the equity section of the balance sheet. Any ineffective portion of a hedging instrument or trading derivative is recorded as an asset or liability with a corresponding charge or credit to the income statement.
Amounts in accumulated OCI are reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transactions affect earnings. In the event of the early extinguishment of a designated debt obligation, any unrealized gain or loss included in OCI is recognized in the income statement coincident with the extinguishment. The Company considers its current IRPAs to be highly effective cash flow hedges. The Company measures the effectiveness of each IRPA quarterly.
Self-Insurance
The Company is self-insured for a portion of its insurable risks, including workers compensation, employee benefits, and general liability. The Company analyzes its claims experience and other information provided by the Companys administrators to determine an adequate liability for self-insured claims.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policiescontinued Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans SFAS 158. SFAS 158 amends SFAS No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 88 Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, SFAS No. 106 Employers Accounting for Postreti
rement Benefits Other than Pensions and SFAS 132 Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The amendments retain most of the existing measurement and disclosure guidance and will not change the amounts recognized in the Companys statement of operations. SFAS 158 requires companies to recognize a net asset or liability with an offset to equity, by which the  obligation is over or under-funded. SFAS 158 requires prospective application, and the recognition and disclosure requirements will be effective for the Companys fiscal year ending December 31, 2006.
The effect of adopting the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS 158 is shown in the following table Before Application ofSFAS 158 Adjustments After Application ofSFAS 158 Current liabilities 419 419 Non-current liability for post-retirement benefits 12,793 774 12,019 Deferred taxes 10,026 147 9,879 Accumulated other comprehensive loss income 24,136 355 23,781 Total stockholders equity 199,635 208 199,843 Additionally, SFAS 158 changes the measurement date to be the end of the Companys fiscal year. The effective date for this part of the statement is for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company has decided to adopt this part of the standard in the first quarter of 2007. Accordingly, the Company expects to recognize a pre-tax, net reduction to retained earnings of approximately $05 million and a pre-tax gain to its OCI of approximately $70 million by changing the measurement date to December 31, 2006.
3.Intangible and Other Assets
In July2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No109 FIN 48, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years, beginning after December15, 2006. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FIN 48 which is expe
cted to be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment and offsetting charge to retained earnings for any increased reserves for uncertain tax positions.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157 Fair Value Measurements, SFAS157, which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates 
55 JOURNAL REGISTER COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3.Intangible and Other Assetscontinued inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the Company has not yet issued financial statements, including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 157, but does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Under SFAS 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but are reviewed, at least, annually, for impairment. Identifiable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to tests of impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144. The Company performed the annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each of fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004. The Company estimated the fair value of its business enterprises by a discounted cash flow technique and used assumptions about the growth of the businesses over the next five years and a terminal growth rat
e of three percent. These cash flows were discounted using a 95 percent weighted average cost of capital inclusive of adjustments for various risk factors. This discounted cash flow indicated that the fair value of the Michigan reporting unit was less than the carrying amount. The Company then allocated this enterprise value to the assets of the reporting unit as required by SFAS 142. The assumptions used in this allocation were that the working capital items and tangible assets approximated their fair value. The identifiable intangible assets were valued using the revenue streams projected for the reporting unit. This resulted in an implied value of the goodwill of the Michigan cluster that was $337 million less than the carrying value. The Company recorded a write-down of goodwill of $337 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and adjusted the carrying value of the goodwill for this amount. For fiscal 2005, there was no indication of impairment to the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite li
ved intangible assets.
The following table displays intangible assets subject to amortization and intangible assets not subject to amortization at December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005 As of Dec. 31, 2006 As of Dec. 25, 2005 In thousands Gross AccumulatedAmortization Net Gross AccumulatedAmortization Net Intangible assets subject to amortization Customer and subscriber lists 9,476 8,678 798 9,476 7,408 2,068 Non-compete covenants 3,653 2,370 1,283 3,623 2,063 1,560 Debt issuance costs 6,267 873 5,394 11,616 1,996 9,620 Total 19,396 11,921 7,475 24,715 11,467 13,248 Intangible assets not subject to

The Company carried a cost basis investment in PowerOne Media LLC PowerOne, a provider of classified advertising on the internet, in the amount of $21 million. In late November 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with a consortium of other newspaper publishers to utilize Yahoos HotJobs web site and share in the revenues generated through HotJobs. Consequently, the Company wrote-down its investment in PowerOne, inclusive of goodwill previously recorded, by $24 million in fiscal year 2006. In the ordinary course of business, the Company had related party sales with PowerOne amounting to approximately $18 million, $33 million and $34 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, 
respectively.

On January 25, 2006, the Company, amended and restated its existing Credit Agreement, dated August 12, 2004, the 2004 Credit Agreement by and among the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent, and other syndicated lenders, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement the Credit Agreement. On January 25, 2006, the Company borrowed $625 million of Term Loan A and $1305 million in revolving credit loans. These borrowings were used to repay term loans and revolving credit loans outstanding on the 2004 Credit Agreement, to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Credit Agreement, and for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement elimin
ated Term Loan B. In connection with this refinancing, the Company wrote off approximately $57 million of deferred loan costs associated with the Previous Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement provides for i a secured term-loan facility Term Loan A with a face amount of $625 million and ii a secured revolving credit facility the Revolving Credit Facility of $375 million. The Credit Agreement also provides for an uncommitted, multiple-draw term-loan facility the Incremental Facility in the amount of up to $500 million, as permitted by the administrative agent, to be repaid under conditions provided for in the Credit Agreement.To date, the Company has not drawn down on the Incremental Facility. As of December 31, 2006, the maximum availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $2540 million 
including the effect of $83 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement, with approximately $74 million currently available based on the terms of the Credit Agreement.
The amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either i 125 percent to 050 percent above LIBOR as defined in the Credit Agreement or ii the higher of a 025 percent to 0 percent above the Prime Rate as defined in the Credit Agreement or b 05 percent above the Federal Funds Rate as defined in the Credit Agreement. The interest rate spreads the applicable margins are dependent upon the ratio of the Companys debt to the Companys trailing four quarters Cash Flow as defined in the Credit Agreement and are reduced or increased as such ratio declines or increases, respectively. The estimated fair value of the Term Loans and Revolving Credit Facility appr
oximates their carrying value.
An annual commitment fee is incurred on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in arrears, at a percentage that varies from 0375 percent to 025 percent based on the quarterly calculation of a specified leverage ratio. At December 31, 2006, the Companys commitment fee was 0375 percent.
The borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2006 under the Credit Agreement bear interest based on either various determined daily plus 125 percent or the Prime Rate plus 025 percent LIBOR rates also see the interest rate derivative section of this footnote. The Credit Agreement provides for mandatory prepayments with the proceeds of certain dispositions and casualty events and with specified percentages of excess cash flow as defined in the Agreement. In addition, the full amount of the borrowings may become immediately due following events of default by the Company or its subsidiaries as specified. At anytime, the Company may prepay borrowings without premium or penalty in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agr
eement, which limit any optional prepayment to the next twelve months of future maturities.
The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain specified financial ratios, and subjects it to specified operational limitations, including, among others, limitations on its ability to incur additional indebtedness, to make certain fundamental Company changes such as mergers and dispositions of assets, to authorize dividends and distributions on the Companys capital stock, to repurchase Company shares, and to undertake certain capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. The borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Companys subsidiaries. The Company and its guarantor subsidiaries have ple
dged substantially all of their assets as collateral for the borrowings.

Upon expiration of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is required to repay or refinance the amounts due to the lenders at that time.
On February 27, 2007, the Company prepaid the next four quarterly installments of Term Loan A amounting to $325 million. The Company made this optional prepayment under the terms of the Credit Agreement from the proceeds of the sales of its New England properties.
Interest Rate Derivatives
In accordance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement, the Company is required to maintain certain Interest Rate Protection Agreements IRPAs on a portion of its debt, to reduce the potential exposure of the Companys future cash flows to fluctuations in variable interest rates on which the interest on the outstanding debt is calculated. The minimum requirement varies depending on the Companys Total Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. From time to time, the Company may enter into additional IRPAs for nominal amounts on the outstanding debt that will, at a minimum, meet the requirements of the Credit Agreement. Each IRPA is designated for all or a portion of the princi
pal balance and term of a specific debt obligation.
Interest Rate Collars.Pursuant to the requirements of the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into certain interest rate hedges Collars that establish a base interest rate ceiling CAP and a base interest rate floor floor at no initial cost to the Company. In the event 90-day LIBOR exceeds the CAP, the Company will receive cash from the issuers to compensate for the rate in excess of the CAP. If the 90-day LIBOR is lower than the floor, the Company will pay cash to the issuers to compensate for the rate below the floor. Each of the Collars is for a fixed notional amount set as forth below. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate notional amount of outstanding Collars in effect was $225 million.

Represents the remaining average of an amortizing notional amount for which the actual notional amount at December 31, 2006 was $75 million. Under SFAS 133, as amended, the fair market value of derivatives is reported as an adjustment to OCI. The IRPAs were fully effective in hedging the changes in cash flows related to the debt obligation during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005. A total deferred gain of approximately $35 million net of deferred taxes of $25 million was reported in OCI as of December 31, 2006 and a total deferred gain of approximately $43 million net of $30 million of deferred taxes as of December 25, 2005. Each IRPA is designated for all or a portion of the principal balance and term of a specific debt obligation. From time to time, the Company may enter into additional IRPAs for nominal amounts on the out
standing debt that will, at a minimum, meet the requirements of the Credit Agreement.
The fair market value of the derivatives is reflective of the price that a third party would be willing to pay or receive in an arms length transaction and includes adjustments to mark-to-market changes in the related interest rates. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the fair value of the IRPAs decreased by $12 million to $60 million. In comparison, the fair value of the Companys hedges during the year ended December 25, 2005, increased by $72 million to $72 million.
The Companys weighted average effective rate was approximately 58 percent, 50 percent and 35 percent for the years ended December 31, 2006, December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, respectively. These effective interest rates include the impact of a $41 million pre-tax benefit, a $10 million pre-tax expense and a $21 million pre-tax expense for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, realized and reported as a component of interest expense related to the IRPAs.
Interest expense includes the nominal interest rates of the debt instrument, effect of IRPAs, commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance cost. Total interest expense related to the bank debt was $448 million, $385 million and $191 million for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Incentive Stock Options
Incentive stock options are granted at no less than fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price per share of common stock underlying all other non-statutory stock options is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board. Stock options generally vest evenly over a five year period at a rate of 20 percent per year commencing on the first anniversary after issuance, continuing through the fifth anniversary, at which time the stock options are fully vested. Upon vesting, options may be exercised at the discretion of the holder at any time until the option expires, which is generally ten years after issuance. There were no stock options granted in 2006.
On October 27, 2005, the Company amended certain option award agreements to accelerate vesting of approximately 14 million options for which the exercise price was above the then current market price. An additional compensation charge of approximately $12 thousand was recognized for the portion of such accelerated options, which were unvested in the money options.

The assumptions used for inputs for volatility and dividend yield are derived from the historical data of the Companys common stock. Assumptions for the risk free interest rate are derived from the appropriate yields on United States Treasury securities and the expected life of options is derived from historical employee option activity.
The following table shows assumptions used in computing fair values of options granted during fiscal years 2005 and 2004. There were no options granted during 2006. 2005 2004 Weighted average risk free interest rate 410 458 Expected annualized volatility 1400 1800 Dividend yield 100 Expected life of option 7 years 7 years The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
Restricted Stock Units
During fiscal 2006, the Company issued 362,730 restricted stock units RSUs pursuant to the 1997 Plan. Of those issued, 42,000 units vest over either one or two years from the date of award. All other units vest based on the achievement of performance milestones over a specified period of time, typically the achievement of certain levels of EBITDA within five years. In 2005, the Company issued an aggregate of 96,999 RSUs pursuant to the 1997 Plan of which, 10,325 were issued to directors of the Company and vest monthly over a twelve-month period, and the remainder were issued to employees and vest based on the achievement of performance-based milestones.
