Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To Board of Directors and Shareholders of   MKS Instruments, Inc.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of MKS
Instruments, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2007
and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
on the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.   As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for stock-based compensation in 2006, and as discussed in
Note9, the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax
positions in 2007.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   
35 Table of Contents   As described in Managements Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Yield
Dynamics, Inc. YDI from its assessment of internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007
because YDI was acquired by the Company in a purchase business
combination during 2007. We have also excluded YDI from our
audit of internal control over financial reporting. YDI is a
wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues
represent approximately 3% and less than 1%, respectively, of
the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
for the year ended December31, 2007.     Boston, Massachusetts   February28, 2008

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Basis of
Presentation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
MKS Instruments, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
collectively, the Company. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.   Net
Income Per Share   Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share is
based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and all dilutive potential common equivalent shares
outstanding. The dilutive effect of options is determined under
the treasury stock method using the average market price for the
period. Common equivalent shares are included in the per share
calculations when the effect of their inclusion would be
dilutive.   The following is a reconciliation of basic to diluted net income
per share

and 5,957,682 during the years ended December31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively, are excluded from the calculation
of diluted net income per common share because their inclusion
would be anti-dilutive.   Stock-Based
Compensation   Effect of
Adoption of SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment   Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for
stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method
as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations APB
25. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recorded for
options issued to employees in fixed amounts with fixed exercise
prices at least equal to the fair market value of the
Companys common stock at the date of grant. The Company
had adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended
by SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure,
SFAS123.   On January7, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of
outstanding stock options granted to employees and officers with
an exercise price of $2300 per share or greater. As a result of
this action, options to purchase approximately
1,600,000shares of the Companys common stock became
exercisable on January7, 2005. No compensation expense was
recorded related to this action as these options had no
intrinsic value on January7, 2005. For purposes of the
SFAS123 pro forma calculation below, the expense related
to the options that were accelerated was $16,886,000, net of
tax, for the year ended December31, 2005. The reason that
the Company accelerated the vesting of the identified stock
options was to reduce the Companys compensation expense in
periods subsequent to the adoption of SFASNo123R,
Share-Based Payment SFAS123R.   As of January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS123R
using the modified prospective method. SFAS123R requires
companies to recognize compensation cost for all stock-based
awards based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards and
to recognize the expense over the requisite service period for
awards expected to vest. Using the modified prospective method
of adopting SFAS123R, MKS began recognizing compensation
expense for equity-based awards granted after January1,
2006 plus unvested awards granted prior to January1, 2006.
Under this method of implementation, prior periods were not
restated. The Company has elected to adopt the alternative
transition method for calculating the tax effects of
equity-based compensation. The alternative transition method
includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance
of the additional paid-in capital pool APIC pool related to
the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to
determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and
consolidated statement of cash flows of the tax effects of
employee equity-based compensation awards that are outstanding
upon the implementation of SFAS123R. Subsequent to the
initial adoption of SFAS123R, the Company calculates
potential windfall or shortfall tax benefits under the treasury
stock method by excluding the impact of pro forma deferred tax
assets.   The Company recognized the full impact of its share-based
payment plans in the consolidated statements of operations for
the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 under
SFAS123R. As of December31, 2007, the Company
capitalized $570,000 of such cost on its consolidated balance
sheet. The Company did not capitalize any

Assumptions   In connection with the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company
reassessed its valuation technique and related assumptions. The
Company determines the fair value of restricted stock based on
the number of shares granted and the closing market price of the
Companys common stock on the date of the award, and
estimates the fair value of stock options and employee stock
purchase rights using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which
is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized
for options in footnote disclosures required under
SFAS123. Such values are recognized as expense on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, net of
estimated forfeitures. The estimation of stock-based awards that
will ultimately vest requires significant judgment. We consider
many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including
types of awards and historical experience. Actual results, and

current estimates.   There were no options granted during the year ended
December31, 2007. The weighted average grant date fair
value of options granted during the year ended December31,
2006, as determined under SFAS123R, and during the year
December31, 2005, as determined under SFAS123, was
$1200 and $827 per share, respectively. The total intrinsic

December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately
$16,462,000, $14,252,000 and $2,858,000, respectively. The fair
values of options at the date of grant were estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted

rights granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $488, $518 and
$418, respectively. The fair value of the employees
purchase rights was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions   	
2007   2006   2005   Employee stock purchase rights   Expected life years   05   05   05   Risk-free interest rate   50     48     27     Expected volatility   330     346     340     Dividend yield   00     00     00     Expected volatilities for 2007 and 2006 are based on a
combination of implied and historical volatilities of our common
stock and based on historical volatilities for 2005; the
expected life represents the weighted average period of time
that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving
consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise
patterns; and the risk-free interest rate is based on the
U.S.Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant
for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option.   The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards that
vested during the year ended December31, 2007, 2006 and
2005 was approximately $4,876,000, $8,111,000 and $10,097,000,
respectively. As of December31, 2007, the unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and the
unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock was
approximately $2,273,000 and $17,247,000 respectively, and will
be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization
period of 09years and 19years, respectively.

Exchange   The functional currency of the majority of the Companys
foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. For those
subsidiaries, assets and liabilities are translated to
U.S.dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense
accounts are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing
during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
consolidated stockholders equity. Foreign exchange
transaction gains and losses, which arise from transaction
activity and are reflected in operations, were immaterial in
2007, 2006 and 2005.   Revenue
Recognition and Accounts Receivable Allowances   Revenue from product sales is recorded upon transfer of title
and risk of loss to the customer provided that there is evidence
of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. In
most transactions, the Company has no obligations to customers
after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to
warranty obligations. In some instances, the Company provides
installation, training, support and services to customers after
the product has been shipped. For revenue arrangements with
multiple deliverables, the Company defers the fair value related
to any undelivered elements until the undelivered element is
delivered. Fair value is the price charged when the element is
sold separately. The Company provides for the estimated costs to
fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of
the related revenue. Shipping and handling fees, if any, billed
to customers are recognized as revenue. The related shipping and
handling costs are recognized in cost of sales. Accounts
receivable allowances include sales returns and bad debt
allowances. The Company monitors and tracks the amount of
product returns and reduces revenue at the time of shipment for
the estimated amount of such future returns, based on historical
experience. The Company makes estimates evaluating its allowance
for doubtful accounts. The Company continuously monitors
collections and payments from its customers and maintains a
provision for estimated credit losses based upon its historical
experience and any specific customer collection issues that it
has identified.   Cash and
Cash Equivalents and Investments   All highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three
months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents. The appropriate classification of investments in
securities is determined at the time of purchase. Debt
securities that the Company does not have the intent and ability
to hold to maturity are classified as
available-for-sale
and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on
securities classified as
available-for-sale
are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
consolidated stockholders equity.   The Company reviews its investment portfolio on a monthly basis
to identify and evaluate individual investments that have
indications of possible impairment. The factors considered in
determining whether a loss is
other-than-temporary
include: the length of time and extent to which fair market
value has been below the cost basis, the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the issuer, credit quality, and the
Companys ability to hold the investment for a period of
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair
value. During this review, as of December31, 2007, the
Company determined that declines in the fair value of two of its
investments in certain commercial paper were
other-than-temporary.
This commercial paper was issued by two structured investment
vehicles SIVs that entered into receivership during the fourth
quarter of 2007 and failed to make payment at maturity. Due to
the mortgage-related assets held by these issuers, they were
exposed to adverse market conditions that affected the value of
their collateral and their ability to access short-term funding.
These investments are not currently trading on active markets,
and therefore, have no readily determinable market value. As a
result of the Companys evaluation as of December31,
2007, it recorded a $1,457,000 impairment charge to earnings
based upon the Company receiving contemporaneous quotes from
established third-party pricing services. This resulted in a new
cost basis for the securities of $4,275,000.

ex-dividend. The cost of marketable securities sold
is determined by the specific identification method and realized
gains or losses are reflected in income and were not material in
2007, 2006 and 2005.   Inventories   The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost
first-in,
first-out method or market. The Company regularly reviews
inventory quantities on hand and records a provision to write
down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net
realizable value, if less than cost, based primarily on its
estimated forecast of product demand.   Property,

Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the
useful lives of property, plant and equipment are capitalized.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense

improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or
the estimated useful life of the leased asset.   Intangible
Assets   Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are
estimated by management based on the fair value of assets
acquired. These include acquired customer lists, technology,
patents, trade name and covenants not to compete. Intangible
assets are amortized from two to eight years on a straight-line
basis which represents the estimated periods of benefit.   Goodwill   Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets
exceeded the fair value of those net assets on the date of
acquisition. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment on an
annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or
more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating
that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of
a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value
of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If
the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value,
an impairment loss is recorded equal to that excess.   Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived
assets, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS144.
SFAS144 requires recognition of impairment of long-lived
assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds
the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets.
If impairment is indicated, the assets are written down to their
estimated fair value.   Research
and Development   Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and
consist mainly of compensation related expenses and project
materials. The Companys research and development efforts
include numerous projects, which generally have duration of 12
to 30months.   In-Process
Research and Development   The Company values tangible and intangible assets acquired
through its business acquisitions at fair value including
in-process research and development IPRD.
The Company determines IPRD through established valuation
techniques for various projects for the development of new
products and technologies and expenses IPRD when technical
feasibility is not reached.   Advertising
Costs   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs
were immaterial in 2007, 2006 and 2005.   Income
Taxes   The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability
method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax
bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The
Company evaluates the realizability of net deferred tax assets
and assesses the need for valuation allowance on a quarterly
basis. The future benefit to be derived from its deferred tax
assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient
future taxable income to realize the assets. The company records

that is more likely than not to be realized. To the extent the
Company establishes a valuation allowance, an expense will be
recorded within the provision for income taxes line on the
statement of operations. As of December31, 2005, the
Company had a valuation allowance of $3,497,000 for its state
tax credit carryforwards. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the
Company determined that it would begin utilizing these
aforementioned state tax credits and reduced the valuation
allowance to reflect the amount of the state tax credits that
are more likely than not expected to be utilized. The remaining
valuation allowance at December31, 2006 was $317,000,
related to the remaining state tax credits acquired with the
purchase of Ion. During 2007, the Company increased the
valuation allowance for the state tax loss carryforwards and
state tax credits acquired in the purchase of YDI. The valuation
allowance is $534,000 at December31, 2007.   New
Accounting Pronouncements   In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the
FASB issued SFASNo157, Fair
Value Measurements SFAS157.
SFAS157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be
based on the assumptions market participants would use when
pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those
assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would
be separately disclosed by level within the fair value
hierarchy. SFAS157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November15, 2007, with early adoption permitted. The
Company does not believe that SFAS157 will have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements. Certain
portions of SFAS157 have been deferred for one year.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Liabilities SFAS159. SFAS159
permits companies to choose to measure certain financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value and requires
that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair
value option has been elected be reported in earnings.
SFAS159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007, although early adoption is permitted.
The Company does not believe that SFAS159 will have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS no. 141R,
Business Combinations, which replaces
SFASNo141. This revised standard requires assets,
liabilities and non-controlling interests acquired to be
measured at fair value and requires that costs incurred to
effect the acquisition be recognized separately from the
business combination. In addition, this statement expands the
scope to include all transactions and other events in which one
entity obtains control over one or more businesses. This
statement is effective for all business combinations for which
the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
annual reporting period beginning on or after December15,
2008. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether the
adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its
consolidated financial statements.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements, an Amendment of ARB No51. This
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. The
Company is in the process of evaluating whether the adoption of
this standard will have a material effect on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.   Use of
Estimates   The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis,
management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation,
inventory, intangible assets, goodwill, and other

expenses, income taxes and investments. Management bases its
estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Financial
Instruments and Risk Management   Foreign
Exchange Risk Management   The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency
denominated intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum
period of fifteen months, using forward exchange contracts
primarily related to Japanese, Korean and European currencies.
These derivatives are designated as cash-flow hedges, and
changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other
comprehensive income until the hedged transaction affects
earnings. When the hedged transaction affects earnings, the
appropriate gain or loss from the derivative designated as a
hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to cost of sales. As of December31,
2007, the amount that will be reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income to cost of sales over the next twelve
months is immaterial. The ineffective portion of the derivatives
is recorded in cost of sales and was immaterial in 2007, 2006
and 2005.   The Company hedges certain intercompany and other payables with
forward foreign exchange contracts. Since these derivatives
hedge existing amounts that are denominated in foreign
currencies, the derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting
under SFASNo133. The foreign exchange gain or loss
on these derivatives was immaterial in 2007, 2006 and 2005.   Realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward exchange
contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognized immediately in earnings. The cash flows resulting
from forward exchange contracts that qualify for hedge
accounting are classified in the consolidated statement of cash
flows as part of cash flows from operating activities. Cash
flows resulting from forward exchange contracts that do not
qualify for hedge accounting are classified in the consolidated
statement of cash flows as investing activities. The Company
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes.   There were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $66,660,000 outstanding at December31, 2007 of
which $39,925,000 were outstanding to exchange Japanese Yen for
U.S.dollars. There were forward exchange contracts with
notional amounts totaling $20,324,000 outstanding at
December31, 2006 of which $14,619,000 were outstanding to
exchange Japanese yen for U.S.dollars. There were forward
exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $35,299,000
outstanding at December31, 2005. Of such forward exchange
contracts, $28,461,000 were outstanding to exchange Japanese yen
for US dollars.   Gains and losses on forward exchange contracts that qualify for
hedge accounting are classified in cost of goods sold and
totaled a gain of $1,312,000, $1,932,000 and $812,000 for the
years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   The fair values of forward exchange contracts at
December31, 2007 and 2006, determined by applying period
end currency exchange rates to the notional contract amounts,
amounted to an unrealized gain of $43,000 and $998,000 for the
years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   Concentrations
of Credit Risk   The Companys significant concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments,
forward exchange contracts and trade accounts receivable. The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with financial
institutions including some banks with which it has borrowings.
The Company maintains

agency securities and corporate debt securities, with minimum
rating of A1-P1 or AAA. The Company enters into forward currency
contracts with high credit-quality financial institutions in
order to minimize credit risk exposure. The Companys
customers are primarily concentrated in the semiconductor
industry, and a limited number of customers account for a
significant portion of the Companys revenues. The Company
regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and
believes it has adequately provided for potential credit loss
exposures. Credit is extended for all customers based primarily
on financial condition and collateral is not required.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   The fair value of the term loans, including the current portion,
approximates its carrying value given its variable rate interest
provisions. The fair value of marketable securities is based on
quoted market prices. The fair value of mortgage notes is based
on borrowing rates for similar instruments and, therefore,
approximates its carrying value. For all other balance sheet
financial instruments, the carrying amount approximates fair
value because of the short period to maturity of these
instruments.   4Inventories   Inventories consist of the following

Agreements and Short-Term Borrowings   On July31, 2007, the Company renewed an unsecured
short-term LIBOR based loan agreement with a bank to be utilized
primarily by its Japanese subsidiary for short-term liquidity
purposes. The credit line, which expires on July31, 2008,
provides for the Company to borrow in multiple currencies of up
to an equivalent of $35,000,000 U.S.dollars. At
December31, 2007, the Company had outstanding borrowings
of $8,952,000 U.S.dollars, payable on demand, at an
interest rate of 162%.   Additionally, the Companys Japanese subsidiary has lines
of credit and short-term borrowing arrangements with two
financial institutions which provide for aggregate borrowings as
of December31, 2007 of up to $22,379,000, which generally
expire and are renewed at three month intervals. At
December31, 2007 and 2006, total borrowings outstanding
under these arrangements were $10,015,000 and $5,041,000,

Revenue Bond which calls for payments of interest only through
July1, 2014, at which time the Bond is repayable in a lump
sum of $5,000,000. Interest is reset annually based on bond
remarketing, with an option by the Company to elect a fixed
rate, subject to a maximum rate of 13% per annum. At
December31, 2007 the interest rate was 40%. The
bond is collateralized by the building. The remaining principal
balance outstanding at December31, 2007 was $5,000,000.
The net book value of the building at December31, 2007 was
approximately $9,472,000.   7Commitments
and Contingencies   On October3, 2005, MKS entered into a settlement agreement
with Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. Advanced
Energy, pursuant to which Advanced Energy paid MKS
$3,000,000 in cash in October 2005. The settlement agreement was
entered into in connection with a patent infringement litigation
suit.   The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims,
which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the
opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters
will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.   The Company leases certain of its facilities and machinery and

components and other equipment and services used in its normal
operations. The majority of these purchase commitments covered
by these arrangements are for periods of less than one year and
aggregate to approximately $103,689,000. Additionally, the
Company has engaged a third party to provide certain computer
equipment, IT network services and IT support. This contract is
for a period of approximately six years beginning in September
2004 and has a significant penalty for early termination. The
obligation at December31, 2007 of approximately
$20,803,000, excluding capital lease and interest payments of
$2,249,000, will be paid over the term of the arrangement.
Average annual payments are expected to be approximately
$6,934,000.   To the extent permitted by Massachusetts law, the Companys
Restated Articles of Organization, as amended, require the
Company to indemnify any of its current or former officers or
directors or any person who has served or is serving in any
capacity with respect to any of the Companys employee
benefit plans. Because no claim for indemnification has been
pursued by any person covered by the relevant provisions of the
Companys Restated Articles of Organization, the Company
believes that the estimated exposure for these indemnification
obligations is currently minimal. Accordingly, the Company has
no liabilities recorded for these requirements as of
December31, 2007.   The Company also enters into agreements in the ordinary course
of business which include indemnification provisions. Pursuant
to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and
agrees to reimburse the indemnified party, generally its
customers, for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified
party in connection with certain patent or other intellectual
property infringement claims, and, in some instances, other
claims, by any third party with respect to the Companys
products. The term of these indemnification obligations is
generally perpetual after execution of the agreement. The
maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be
required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in
some instances, not contractually limited. The Company has never
incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to
these indemnification obligations. As a result, the Company
believes the estimated fair value of these obligations is
minimal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded
for these obligations as of December31, 2007.   When, as part of an acquisition, the Company acquires all of the
stock or all of the assets and liabilities of another company,
the Company assumes liability for certain events or occurrences

the Company could be required to make for such obligations is
undeterminable at this time. Other than obligations recorded as
liabilities at the time of the acquisitions, historically the
Company has not made significant payments for these
indemnifications. Accordingly, no liabilities have been recorded
for these obligations.   In conjunction with certain asset sales, the Company may provide
routine indemnifications whose terms range in duration and often
are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, an obligation for
such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the
amounts of liability under these types of indemnifications are
not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the
obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably
estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the
time of the asset sale, historically the Company has not made
significant payments for these indemnifications.   8Stockholders

Repurchase Program   On February12, 2007, MKS Board of Directors approved
a share repurchase program the Program for the
repurchase of up to $300,000,000 of its outstanding stock over
the subsequent two years. The repurchases may be made from time
to time on the open market or through privately negotiated
transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased
under the Program will depend on a variety of factors, including
price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital
availability, and other market conditions. The Program may be
discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Company and
its Board of Directors. During the year ended December31,
2007, the Company repurchased 4,779,000shares of common
stock for $101,157,000 for an average price of $2117 per share.
From January1, 2008 through February21, 2008, the
Company purchased 812,210shares of common stock for
$15,744,914, representing an average price of $1939 per share.   Stock

The price at which an employees option is exercised is the
lower of 185% of the closing price of the Common Stock
on the NASDAQ Global Market on the day that each offering
commences or 285% of the closing price on the day that
each offering terminates. During 2007 and 2006, the Company
issued 166,127 and 120,515shares, respectively, of Common
Stock to employees who participated in the Purchase Plan at
exercise prices of $1764 and $1544 per share in 2007 and
$1659 and $1765per share in 2006, respectively. As of
December31, 2007, there were 305,445shares reserved
for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.   The Companys Second Amended and Restated International
Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Foreign Purchase
Plan authorizes the issuance of up to an aggregate of
250,000shares of Common Stock to participating employees.
Offerings under the Foreign Purchase Plan commence on June 1 and
December 1 and terminate, respectively, on November 30 and
May31. Under the Foreign Purchase Plan, eligible employees
may purchase shares of Common Stock through payroll deductions
of up to 10% of their compensation. The price at which an
employees option is exercised is the lower of 185%
of the closing price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global

During 2007 and 2006, the Company issued 32,803 and 23,236,
respectively, shares of Common Stock to employees who
participated in the Foreign Purchase Plan at exercise prices of
$1764 and $1544per share in 2007 and $1659 and $1765
per share in 2006, respectively. As of December31, 2007,
there were 82,417shares reserved for future issuance under
the Foreign Purchase Plan.

Incentive Plans   The Companys equity incentive plans the
Plans are intended to attract and retain employees
and to provide an incentive for them to assist the Company to
achieve long-range performance goals and to enable them to
participate in the long-term growth of the Company. Employees
may be granted restricted stock and restricted stock units
collectively, restricted stock, options to
purchase shares of the Companys stock and other equity
incentives under the Plans.   The Companys 2004 Stock Incentive Plan the 2004
Plan was adopted by the board of directors on
March4, 2004 and approved by the stockholders on
May13, 2004. As of December31, 2007 there were
8,245,399shares authorized for issuance under the 2004
Plan, which amount shall increase each year by an amount equal
to 5% of the total outstanding shares of the Companys
common stock outstanding on January 1 of such year, provided
that the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock
which may be issued under the 2004 Plan is
15,000,000shares subject to adjustment for certain
changes in MKS capitalization. The Company may grant
options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights and
other stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors,
consultants and advisors under the 2004 Plan. As of
December31, 2007 there were 6,832,159shares
available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.   The Companys Second Restated 1995 Stock Incentive Plan
the 1995 Plan expired in November 2005 and no
further awards may be granted under the 1995 Plan, although
there are still outstanding options available for exercise under
this plan.   The Companys 1997Director Stock Plan the
1997Director Plan provides for ithe
initial grant of options to purchase 20,000shares of
common stock to each person who first becomes an outside
director and iiannual grants of options to purchase
12,000shares of common stock on the date of the annual
meeting of stockholders. In December 2004, the board of
directors amended the 1997Director Plan to allow for all
options granted on or after May17, 2000 to be exercisable
within the three year period from the date of the
directors termination as director. On March4, 2004,
the board of directors approved, and on May13, 2004, the
stockholders approved, an increase in the number of shares
available for issuance under the 1997Director Plan from
300,000shares to 750,000shares. The 1997 Director
Plan was terminated on February12, 2007.   On January7, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of
outstanding options with an exercise price of $2300 or greater.
As a result of this action, options to purchase approximately
1,600,000shares became exercisable on January7,
2005. No compensation expense was recorded in 2005 related to
this action as these options had no intrinsic value on
January7, 2005. The reason that the Company accelerated
the vesting of the identified stock options was to reduce the
Companys compensation charges in future years.   The Company has granted options to employees under the 2004
Plan, 1995 Plan and the 1993 Stock Option Plan and to directors
under the 1997Director Plan and the 1996Director
Stock Option Plan collectively, the Plans. The
Plans are administered by the compensation committee of the
Companys board of directors.   At December31, 2007, 6,832,159shares of the
Companys common stock were available for future grants
under the Plans. Stock options are granted at an exercise price
equal to 100% of the fair value of the Companys common
stock. Generally, stock options granted to employees under the
Plans in 2001 and after, vest 25% after one year and 625% per
quarter thereafter, and expire 10years after the grant
date. Generally, stock options granted under the Plans prior to
2000 vest 20% after one year and 5% per quarter thereafter, and
expire 10years after the grant date. Options granted to
directors generally vest at the earliest of 1the next
annual meeting, 213months from date of grant, or
3the effective date of an acquisition. Restricted stock
awards generally vest three years from the date of grant.

YDI, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward
of $8,832,000 and a federal general business credit carryforward
of $810,000. The Companys intention is to carryforward
both these tax attributes, subject to the limitations of the
Internal Revenue Code. The loss and credit carryforwards expire
at various dates through 2027.   At December31, 2006, as a result of the acquisition of Ion
Systems Inc., the Company had a federal net operating loss
carryforward of $1,216,000 and a federal general business credit
carryforward of $71,000. The Company carried both of these tax
attributes to previous Ion tax years and recovered $497,000 of
previously paid taxes.   Although the Company believes that its tax positions are
consistent with applicable U.S.federal, state and
international laws, certain tax reserves are maintained at
December31, 2007 should these positions be challenged by
the applicable tax authority and additional tax assessed on
audit.   The Company has adopted FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN48, as of
January1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of
FIN48, the Company did not recognize an adjustment in the
liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. A reconciliation
of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax
benefits is as follows   	
Balance at January1, 2007     11,637,000   Increases for prior years   1,264,000   Increases for the current year   3,240,000   Reductions related to settlements with taxing authorities     Reductions related to expiration of statute of limitations   18,000     Balance at December31, 2007     16,123,000   At December31, 2007, if these benefits were recognized in
a future period, the timing of which is not estimable, the net
unrecognized tax benefit of approximately $13,242,000 would
impact our effective tax rate.   MKS and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S.federal income
tax as well as the income tax of multiple state and foreign
jurisdictions. The Company has concluded all U.S.federal
income tax matters for years through 2002. The 2003 Federal tax
year remains open to the extent of the loss carryforwards to
2004 and 2005. As of December31, 2007, there were on-going
audits in various other tax jurisdictions.   Over the next 12months it is reasonably possible that the
Company may recognize $4,300,000 to $4,800,000 of previously
unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal, state and
foreign tax positions as a result of the conclusion of various
audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations. The
following tax years, in the major tax jurisdictions noted, are
open for assessment or refund: U.S.Federal: 2003 to 2006,
Germany: 2001 to 2006, Korea: 2005 to 2006, Japan: 2000 to 2006
and the United Kingdom: 2005 and 2006.   The Company accrues interest and penalties, if applicable, for
any uncertain tax positions. Any interest and penalty expense is
a component of income tax expense. At the date of adoption of
FIN48 and at December31, 2007, the Company had
$700,000 and $1,500,000, respectively, accrued for interest on
unrecognized tax benefits.   For the year ended December31, 2007, the Company amended
prior federal tax returns to reflect revised estimates for
qualifying research and development costs that allowed the
company to claim additional research tax credits. As a result of
this claim, the Company recorded a benefit to income tax expense
of $1,800,000million.   During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
received a notification letter from the Israeli Ministry of
Industry Trade and Labor MITL indicating that its
Israeli operations were in compliance with requirements relating
to the tax holiday granted to its manufacturing operations in
Israel in 2001. This tax holiday is anticipated to expire in

savings of $3,393,000, $5,125,000 and $1,190,000 for the years
ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   Additionally, for the year ended December31, 2006, the
Company recorded the impact of both a change in German tax rules
allowing interest deductions on certain loans and adjustments
relating to transfer pricing. As a result of these items the
Company recorded additional income tax benefits of $1,565,000
for the year ended December31, 2006. The net reduction in
the valuation allowance for the year ended December31,
2006 resulted from the utilization of tax credit carryovers of
$2,706,000 and the expiration of credits of $474,000 on a merged
subsidiary.   During 2005, the Internal Revenue Service IRS
completed its examination of the Companys tax returns for
the tax years 1999 through 2002. As a result of this
examination, during the year ended December31, 2005, the
Company recorded a reduction in income taxes payable of
$1,621,000, a benefit to income tax expense of $1,901,000 and a
$576,000 reduction of goodwill related to a previous acquisition.   On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
the Act was signed into law. The Act contains a
provision allowing U.S.multinational companies a one-time
incentive to repatriate foreign earnings at an effective tax
rate of 525%. During 2005, the Company conducted an extensive
study of the new provision and concluded that no opportunities
existed from which the Company could benefit from repatriation
of its undistributed foreign earnings. Through December31,
2007, the Company has not provided deferred income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such
earnings were intended to be permanently reinvested outside the
U.S.Determination of the potential deferred income tax
liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable
because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances
existing if and when remittance occurs. At December31,
2007, the Company had $199,253,000 of undistributed earnings in
its foreign subsidiaries.   10Employee
Benefit Plans   The Company has a 401k profit-sharing plan for
U.S.employees meeting certain requirements in which
eligible employees may contribute between 1% and 50% of their
annual compensation to this plan, and, with respect to employees
who are age50 and older, certain specified additional
amounts, limited by an annual maximum amount determined by the
IRS. The Company, at its discretion, may provide a matching
contribution which will generally match up to the first 2% of
each participants compensation, plus 25% of the next 4% of
compensation. At the discretion of the board of directors, the
Company may also make additional contributions for the benefit
of all eligible employees. The Companys contributions were
$2,516,000 $2,385,000 and $1,894,000 for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.   The Company maintains a bonus plan which provides cash awards to
key employees, at the discretion of the compensation committee

Table in
thousands, except share and per share data   13Goodwill
and Intangible Assets   The Company is required to perform an annual impairment test of
its goodwill under the provisions of SFAS142.
SFAS142 requires that companies identify and assess
goodwill at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are
defined as operating segments or one level below an operating
segment, referred to as a component. The Company has determined
that its reporting units are components of its operating
segment. The Company allocates goodwill to reporting units at
the time of acquisition and bases that allocation on which
reporting units will benefit from the acquired assets and
liabilities. The fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill
is compared to its recorded book value. An excess of book value
over fair value indicates that an impairment of goodwill exists.
Fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis of
expectations of future earnings for each of the reporting units
with goodwill. The Company completed its annual impairment test
for 2007 and 2006 and concluded that no impairment of goodwill
existed as of October31, 2007 or October31, 2006,
the annual goodwill measurement date.   The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the years

Controls
and Procedures   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Our management with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e
and
15d-15e
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act, as of December31, 2007.
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
these disclosure controls and procedures are effective and
designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
requisite time periods.   Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls   Our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures and internal controls provide reasonable assurance
that the objectives of our control system are met. However, our
management including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer does not expect that the disclosure controls
and procedures or internal controls will prevent all errors and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, errors
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been or
will be detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and
that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
management override of the control. The design of any system is
also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurances that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected.   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act as a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected
by the Companys Board of Directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes those
policies and procedures that   
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the Company   
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company;and   
67 Table of Contents   
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007.
In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control
Integrated Framework.   Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of
December31, 2007, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria.   Management has excluded the operations of Yield Dynamics, Inc.
YDI from its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007 because this
entity was acquired by the Company in a purchase business
combination during fiscal 2007. The total assets and total
revenues of the acquired businesses of YDI represent
approximately 3% and less than 1%, respectively, of the related
consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year
ended December31, 2007.   Our internal controls over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007 have been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which
appears on pages35 through 36.   Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f
under the Exchange Act during our fourth fiscal quarter that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
