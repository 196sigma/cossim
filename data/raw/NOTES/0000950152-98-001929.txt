NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
dollars in thousands 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Olympic Steel, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries collectively the Company
or Olympic, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
Investments in the Company three joint ventures are accounted for under the
equity method. Certain amounts in the 1996 and 1995 consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the 1997 presentation.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CONCENTRATION RISKS
The Company is a major customer of flat-rolled coil and plate steel for many of
its principal suppliers, but is not dependent on any one supplier. The Company
purchased approximately 22% and 18% of its total steel requirements from a
single supplier in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the cost of
purchased steel, internal and external processing and freight. Cost is
determined using the specific identification method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND DEPRECIATION
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years.
GOODWILL AND AMORTIZATION
Goodwill includes the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired
and is being amortized on a straight-line method over 40 years. In the event
that facts and circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or other
long-lived assets may be impaired, the Company evaluates recoverability to
determine if a write-down to market value is required. Goodwill amortization
expense totaled $353 in 1997, and $260 in both 1996 and 1995. Accumulated
amortization of goodwill totaled $873 and $520 at December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized when steel is shipped to the customer. Sales returns and
allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on
historical experience and current estimates.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share has been calculated based on the weighted average number of
shares outstanding. Shares outstanding were 86 million through August 8, 1996
and 107 million since August 9, 1996. The Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings per
Share, which became effective for financial statements for periods ending after
December 15, 1997. The implementation of SFAS No. 128 had no effect on the
Company earnings per share data. Basic and diluted earnings per share are the
same, as the effect of dilutive outstanding stock options is immaterial.  26 2. PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK:
The Company completed its initial public offering of 4 million common shares in
March, 1994. In August, 1996, the Company completed the sale of an additional
21 million shares of common stock. The net proceeds of $49,100 were used to
repay borrowings outstanding under the Company bank credit agreements. 3. ACQUISITIONS:
Effective June 1, 1997, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Southeastern Metal Processing, Inc. and
Southeastern Transshipping Realty Southeastern. Southeastern operated as a
metals toll processor and is located near Atlanta, Georgia. The preliminary
purchase price, which is subject to post-closing adjustments and includes
assumed liabilities, totaled approximately $17,200. The adjusted cash portion of
the purchase price, including fees and expenses and the repayment of $2,500 of
Southeastern bank debt, approximated $13,700. The acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, assets and liabilities are
reflected at estimated fair values. The preliminary purchase price allocation
resulted in goodwill of approximately $3,700 which is being amortized over 40
years.
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of
substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Lafayette
Steel Company Lafayette Steel. Lafayette Steel is an intermediate steel
processor headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, primarily serving the automotive
industry. The final purchase price totaled $69,833 and exceeded the net book
value of the assets acquired by $13,000. The adjusted cash portion of the
purchase price, including fees and expenses and the repayment of $30,069 of
Lafayette Steel existing bank debt, totaled $52,345. The acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, assets and liabilities are
reflected at estimated fair values. The final purchase price allocation resulted
in goodwill of $10,395, which is being amortized over 40 years. 4. INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES:
In January 1997, the Company completed the formation of Olympic Continental

companies. OLP is constructing a new facility and initially equipping it with
two laser-welding lines. Production is expected to begin in the second half of

guarantees, on a several basis, 50% of OLP outstanding debt under its $20,000
bank loan agreement. OLP debt outstanding at December 31, 1997 totaled $8,900.

In December 1995, the Company entered into an agreement to sell, on a revolving
basis, through its wholly-owned entity, Olympic Steel Receivables LLC, an
undivided interest in a designated pool of its trade accounts receivable. In
July 1997, the agreement was amended to increase the maximum amount of
receivables available for sale from $65,000 to $70,000, and the term of the
agreement was extended to July 31, 2000. The Company, as agent for the purchaser
of the receivables, retains collection and administrative responsibilities for
the participating interests sold. As collections reduce the receivables included
in the pool, the Company may sell additional undivided interests in new
receivables up to the $70,000 limit. The amount of receivables sold by the
Company typically will change monthly depending upon the level of defined
eligible receivables available for sale at each month end settlement date.
As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, $64,000 and $55,000, respectively, of
receivables were sold and reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Proceeds from the initial sale were
used to reduce borrowings under the Company revolving credit agreement and are
reflected as operating cash flows in the accompanying 1995 consolidated
statement of cash flows. Costs of the program, which primarily consist of the
purchaser financing cost of issuing commercial paper backed by the
receivables, totaled $3,791 in 1997, $3,393 in 1996, and $107 in 1995, and have
been classified as Receivable Securitization Expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.

that vary based on a bank base rate, LIBOR, the short-term tax exempt revenue
bond index or taxable rate note market.

In January 1994, the Stock Option Plan Option Plan was adopted by the Board of
Directors and approved by the shareholders of the Company. Pursuant to the
provisions of the Option Plan, key employees of the Company, non-employee
directors and consultants may be offered the opportunity to acquire shares of
Common Stock by the grant of stock options, including both incentive stock
options ISOs and nonqualified stock options. ISOs are not available to
non-employee directors or consultants. A total of 450,000 shares of Common Stock
has been reserved for options under the Option Plan. The purchase price of a
share of Common Stock pursuant to an ISO will not be less than the fair market
value of a share of Common Stock at the grant date. Options vest over a period
of five years at a rate of 20% per year commencing on the first anniversary of
the date of grant, and expire 10 years after the date of grant. The Option Plan
will terminate on January 5, 2004. Termination of the Option Plan will not
affect outstanding options.
During 1997, 1996 and 1995, nonqualified options to purchase 8,000, 12,500, and
20,000 shares, respectively, were issued under the Option Plan to the Company
