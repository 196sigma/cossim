and its subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and

financial statement schedulelisted in the Index at . These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement scheduleare the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedulebased
on our audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and performthe
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. In our opinion,
such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company at December31, 2005 and
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We have also
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the

TELEVISION, INC. Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements 1. Nature of Operations Hearst-Argyle Television,Inc.
and its subsidiaries we or the Company own and operate 25
network-affiliated television stations in geographically diverse markets in the
United States. Ten of the stations are affiliates of the National Broadcasting
Company,Inc. NBC, 12 of the stations are affiliates of the American
Broadcasting Companies ABC, two of the stations are affiliates of Columbia
Broadcasting Systems CBS and one station is affiliated with Warner Brothers
Television Network WB. Additionally, the Company provides management
services to two network-affiliated and one independent television stations and
two radio stations the Managed Stations. The Company has determined that
its single reportable segment is commercial television broadcasting. The
economic characteristics, services, production process, customer type and
distribution methods for the Companys operations are substantially similar and
have therefore been aggregated as one reportable segment. 2. Summary of
Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates General The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, except for the
Companys wholly-owned subsidiary trust which was required to be
de-consolidated upon adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Interpretation No46 revised December2003, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46R. The net effect of such
deconsolidation was to eliminate the Convertible Preferred Securities and show
the Note payable to the Capital Trust in noncurrent liabilities. With the
exception of the unconsolidated subsidiary trust, all significant intercompany
accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, the Company
evaluates its estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful
accounts; program rights, barter and trade transactions; useful lives of
property, plant and equipment; intangible assets; carrying value of
investments; accrued liabilities; contingent liabilities; income taxes; pension
benefits; and fair value of financial instruments and stock options. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Comprehensive Income In
accordance with SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, the Company is required to display comprehensive income and
its components as partof its complete set of financial statements. Comprehensive
income represents the change in stockholders equity resulting from
transactions other then stockholder investments and distributions. Included in
accumulated other comprehensive income are changes in equity that are excluded
from the Companys net income, specifically, additional minimum pension
liabilities, net of tax. Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to
be cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable The Company extends credit
based upon its evaluation of a customers credit worthiness and financial
condition. For certain advertisers, the Company does not extend credit and
requires cash payment in advance. The Company monitors the collection of
receivables and maintains an allowance for estimated losses based upon the
aging of such receivables and specific collection issues that maybe
identified. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
generally limited due to the large number of geographically diverse customers,
individually small balances, and short payment terms. Program Rights Program rights and the
corresponding contractual obligations are recorded when the license period
begins and the programs are available for use. Program rights are carried at
the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value on a program by
program basis. Any reduction in unamortized costs to net realizable value is
included in amortization of program rights in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Income. Such reductions in unamortized costs were $22 million in
the year ended December31, 2004, and were negligible in the years ended December31,
2005 and 2003. Programming rights are amortized over the license period. The
majority of the Companys programming rights are for first-run programming
which is 46 generally amortized over one year. Rights for
off-network syndicated products, feature films and cartoons are amortized based
on the projected number of airings on an accelerated basis contemplating the
estimated revenue to be earned per showing, but generally not exceeding five
years. Program rights and the corresponding contractual obligations are
classified as current or long-term based on estimated usage and payment terms. Barter and Trade Transactions Barter transactions
represent the exchange of commercial air time for programming. Trade
transactions represent the exchange of commercial air time for merchandise or
services. Barter transactions are recorded at the fair market value of the
commercial air time relinquished. Trade transactions are generally recorded at
the fair market value of the merchandise or services received. Barter program
rights and payables are recorded for barter transactions based upon the
availability of the broadcast property. Revenue is recognized on barter and
trade transactions when the commercials are broadcast; expenses are recorded
when the programming airs or when the merchandise or service is utilized.
Barter and trade revenue are included in total revenue on the Consolidated
Statements of Income and were approximately $250 million, $270 million and
$278 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Of these amounts, trade revenue represented less than 20% in each
of the years. Barter and trade expenses are included in Salaries, benefits and
other operating costs under Station operating expenses on the Consolidated
Statements of Income and were approximately $251 million, $272 million and
$277 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Of these amounts, trade expense represented less than 15% in each
of the years. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and
equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives as follows: buildings40 years; towers
and transmitters15 to 20 years; other broadcasting equipmentfive to eight
years; office furniture, computers, equipment and otherthree to eight years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the
shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Management
reviews, on a continuing basis, the financial statement carrying value of
property, plant and equipment for impairment. If events or changes in
circumstances were to indicate that an asset carrying value maynot be
recoverable utilizing related undiscounted cash flows, a write-down of the
asset would be recorded through a charge to operations. Management also reviews
the continuing appropriateness of the useful lives assigned to property, plant
and equipment. Prospective adjustments to such lives are made when warranted. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are recorded at cost and include Federal
Communications Commission FCC licenses, network affiliations, goodwill, and
other intangible assets such as advertiser client base and favorable leases.
The Company performs a review for impairment of its recorded goodwill and FCC
license, which are its only intangible assets with indefinite useful lives,
annually in the fourth quarter or earlier if indicators of potential impairment
exist. The impairment test for FCC
license consists of a comparison of its carrying value with its fair value,
determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying value of the
intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an
amount equal to that excess. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first
step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment
by comparing carrying value of the
reporting unit to its fair value, estimated using a discounted cash flow
analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,
goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step
of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting
unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is
performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying
amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an
amount equal to that excess. Various judgmental assumptions about cash flows, growth rates and
discount rates are used in developing a discounted cash flow analysis. Discount
rate assumptions are based on the weighted average cost of capital of industry
participants. The Company considers the assumptions used in its estimates to be
reasonable, however, had the Company used different assumptions, the Companys
reported results mayhave varied. 47 The Company amortizes intangible assets with determinable useful lives
over their respective estimated useful lives as follows: network affiliation
intangible assets - 285 years, advertiser client base -19 years, other
intangible assets - 5-10 years. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the
Company evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets with
determinable lives each reporting period to determine whether events or
circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Investments The Company has investments
in non-consolidated affiliates, which are accounted for under the equity method
if the Companys equity interest is from 20% to 50%, and under the cost method
if the Companys equity interest is less than 20% and the Company does not
exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. In
addition, the Company has a wholly-owned unconsolidated subsidiary trust which
is accounted for under the equity method. See Note 7. The Company evaluates its
investments to determine if an impairment has occurred. Carrying values are
adjusted to reflect realizable value, where necessary. See Note 3. Revenue Recognition The Companys primary source
of revenue is television advertising. Other sources include network
compensation and other revenue. Advertising revenue and network compensation
together represented approximately 98% of the Companys total revenue in each
of the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Advertising Revenue. Advertising
revenue is recognized net of agency and national representatives commissions
and in the period when the commercials are broadcast. Barter and trade revenue
are included in advertising revenue and are also recognized when the
commercials are broadcast. See Barter and Trade Transactions above. Network Compensation. Twelve
of the Companys stations have network compensation agreements with ABC, ten
have agreements with NBC, and two have agreements with CBS. In connection with
the ABC and CBS agreements, revenue is recognized when the Companys station
broadcasts specific network television programs based upon a negotiated value
for each program. In connection with the NBC agreements, revenue is recognized
on a straight-line basis, based upon the cash compensation to be paid to the
Companys stations by NBC each year. Unlike the ABC and CBS agreements, the NBC
network compensation is an annual amount and is not specifically assigned to
individual network television programs. Other Revenue. The Company
generates revenue from other sources, which include the following types of
transactions and activities: imanagement fees earned from The Hearst
Corporation Hearst see Note 14; iiservices revenue from Lifetime
Entertainment Services see Note 14; iiiservices revenue from the
production of commercials for advertising customers or from the production of
programs to be sold in syndication; ivrental income pursuant to tower
lease agreements with third parties providing for attachment of antennas to the
Companys towers; and vother miscellaneous revenue, such as licenses
and royalties. Income Taxes The provision for income
taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. The Company provides for federal and state income taxes
currently payable, as well as for those deferred because of timing differences
between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus
tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company records reserves
for estimates of probable settlements of federal and state audits. The results
of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities mayaffect the
ultimate settlement of these issues. The timing of any payments related to such
settlements cannot be determined but the Company expects that these payments
will not be made within one year and, as such, these tax reserves are included
in Other Liabilities noncurrent. The Company also records a valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating
and capital losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
such losses will not be realized. The Companys effective tax rate in a given
financial statement period maybe materially impacted by changes in the
level of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, changes in the expected outcome of
tax audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance. 48 Earnings Per Share EPS Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing net income less preferred stock dividends by the weighted average
common shares outstanding see Note 8. Diluted EPS is calculated similarly,
except that it includes the dilutive effect, if any, of shares issuable under
the Companys stock option plan see Note 12, the conversion of the Companys
Preferred Stock see Note 11, or the conversion of the Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities held by the Companys wholly-owned unconsolidated
subsidiary trust see Note 7. Off-Balance Sheet Financings and
Liabilities Other than contractual
commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of
business, agreements for future barter and program rights not yet available for
broadcast as of December31, 2005, and employment contracts for key
employees, which are disclosed in Note 15, the Company does not have any
off-balance sheet financings or liabilities. Other than its wholly-owned
unconsolidated subsidiary trust, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as Note payable to Capital Trust, the Company does not have any
majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial
statements, nor does the Company have any interests in, or relationships with,
any special-purpose entities that are not reflected in the consolidated
financial statements. Purchase Accounting When allocating the purchase
price to the acquired assets tangible and intangible and assumed liabilities,
it is necessary to develop estimates of fair value. The Company utilizes the
services of an independent valuation consulting firm for the purpose of
estimating fair values. The specialized tangible assets in use at a
broadcasting business are typically valued on the basis of the replacement cost
of a new asset less observed depreciation. The appraisal of other fixed assets,
such as furnishings, vehicles, and office machines, is based upon a comparable
market approach. Identified intangible assets, including FCC licenses, are
valued at estimated fair value. FCC licenses are valued using a direct
approach. The direct approach measures the future economic benefits that the
FCC license brings to its holder and discounts them to the present. The fair
market value of the FCC license is determined by discounting these future
benefits utilizing discounted cash flows. The key assumptions used in the
discounted cash flow analysis include initial and subsequent capital costs,
network affiliation, VHF or UHF status, market revenue growth and station
market share projections, operating profit margins, discount rates and terminal
value estimates. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for employee stock-based
compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related
interpretations. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the Companys
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date
of grant, the stock options have no intrinsic value and therefore no
compensation expense is recognized. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting For Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123. Under SFAS 123, options are valued at
their date of grant and then expensed over their vesting period. See Note 12
and the New Accounting Pronouncements disclosure regarding SFAS 123R. The following table details the effect on net
income and earnings per share had compensation expense been recorded based on
the fair value method under SFAS 123, as amended, utilizing the Black-Scholes
option valuation model

49 The Company accounts for the
income tax benefit resulting from the deduction triggered by the exercise of
employee stock options as a credit to stockholders equity additional paid-in
capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders Equity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
Issue No00-15, Classification in the
Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon
Exercise of a Non-Qualified Employee Stock Option, the Company
classifies the reduction of income taxes payable, as a result of the deduction
triggered by the exercise of employee stock options, as an increase in
operating cash flow on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Reclassifications For comparability, certain
immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified in the consolidated
statements of cash flows to conformto the 2005 presentation. Such amounts
were within the investing sectionand are immaterial. New Accounting Pronouncements In June2005, the EITF
reached a consensus on EITF No05-6, Determining the
Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception
or Acquired in a Business Combination EITF 05-6, which was
modified in September2005. EITF 05-6 provides guidance on whether a lease
term should be reevaluated at the time of a purchase business combination or
when leasehold improvements are purchased after lease inception. EITF 05-6 is
effective for leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in
reporting periods beginning after June29, 2005. The adoption of this
standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial
statements. In June2005, the
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No04-10,
Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating
Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds,EITF No04-10.
EITF 04-10 provides guidance on FAS 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information and how to determine
whether operating segments which do not meet certain quantitative thresholds maybe
aggregated and reported as a single operating segment. The EITF is effective
for fiscal years ending after September15, 2005, and corresponding
information for earlier periods, including interim periods, should be restated
unless it is impractical to do so. The Company has adopted the guidance as of
the year ending December31, 2005 and the adoption did not have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations. In May2005, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections SFAS 154. SFAS
154 provides guidance on accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and
error corrections. It requires changes in accounting principle to be applied
retroactively to prior periods as if the principle had always been used. Previously,
voluntary changes in accounting principle were required to be recognized
cumulatively in net income in the period of change. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after December15,
2005 with early adoption encouraged. The Company did not make any accounting
changes or error corrections during the year ended December31, 2005 and
therefore, the adoption of SFAS 154 did not have any material impact on our
financial position or results of operations. In March2005, the FASB
issued Financial Interpretation No47, Accounting
for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB
Statement No143, FIN 47. FIN 47 clarifies that an entity
must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the
fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective
no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December15, 2005. Therefore,
FIN 47 is effective for the year ending December31, 2005. The adoption of
FIN 47 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations. In December2004, the
FASB issued Statement No123R, Share-Based Payment
SFAS 123R, which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation
expense for all stock-based payments at fair value. The Company will adopt SFAS
123R on January1, 2006 using the modified prospective approach. The
Company expects to record approximately $81 million of stock-based
compensation during the year ending December31, 2006 as a result of this
adoption. 50 In December2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No29 SFAS 153. The amendments
made by SFAS 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary
assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Further,
the amendments broaden the exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that
do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset
exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. Therefore,
SFAS 153 was effective for us on July1, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations. In March2004, the EITF
reached a consensus on EITF Issue No03-1, The Meaning
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments
EITF No03-1, which provides guidance on the meaning of the phrase
other-than-temporary impairment and its applications to several types of
investments including debt securities classified as held-to-maturity and
available-for-sale as well as cost-method investments. Additional guidance on
the evaluation of whether the impairment on investments not accounted for using
the equity method is other then temporary and how to measure the investment was
provided in FSP FAS 115-1 / FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. The Company adopted
EITF 03-1 for the year ended December31, 2004. The Company has adopted
FSP FAS 115-1 / FAS 124-1 for the year ended December31, 2005 and
evaluated all cost method investments for any impairment loss that is other
than temporary in accordance with this guidance. The adoption of FSP FAS 115-1
/ FAS 124-1 did not have any impact on our financial position or results of
operations. In December2003, the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act
was signed into law. The Act provides a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree
healthcare benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare PartD. In May2004, the
FASB staff issued FASB Staff Position No106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
which supersedes FASB Staff Position No106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, and is
effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June15, 2004. The
Company determined that the Act is not a significant event as defined by SFAS
106, Employers Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The Act did not have a
material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 3. Acquisitions,

Investment in Internet Broadcasting Systems,Inc.
During the periods presented the Company had investment in Internet
Broadcasting Systems,Inc. Internet Broadcasting and, during the
periods presented through December22, 2005, the Company had an investment
in IBS/HATV LLC, the parent company of 26 wholly-owned subsidiary limited
liability companies. Internet Broadcasting operates a national network of
station Internet sites and designs, develops and operates station Internet
sites under operating agreements. IBS/HATV LLC owned the Internet sites for
each of the Companys television stations. The initial $20 million investment
in exchange for shares of preferred stock representing an approximately 24%
equity interest in Internet Broadcasting was made in December1999,
followed by an additional $6 million investment in bridge loans issued by
Internet Broadcasting in May2001. On December22,
2005, the investment in Internet Broadcasting and the IBS/HATV LLC relationship
were strategically restructured to provide for new content initiatives, new
sales opportunities and enhanced capital resources for Internet Broadcasting. Under
the new arrangement, Internet Broadcasting will continue to manage a national
network of station Internet sites and design, develop and operate the Internet
sites under an operating agreement. However, IBS/HATV LLC and its 51 subsidiaries will be dissolved resulting in
the recognition of local website operating results directly on the books of the
Companys television stations commencing in January2006. Investment in Internet Broadcasting. 
As a result of the restructuring on December22, 2005, the Companys
investment in preferred stock and bridge loans was converted into shares of
Internet Broadcasting common stock, increasing the Companys ownership
percentage from 24% to 311%. Subsequently, in January2006, the Company
purchased Internet Broadcasting common stock from an existing Internet
Broadcasting investor for $55 million, increasing its ownership percentage to
38%. We will continue to account for our investment in Internet Broadcasting
using the equity method. IBS/HATV LLC Limited Liability Company. As
described above, a component of the restructuring was the dissolution of
IBS/HATV LLC, effective December31, 2005. The Company expects to receive
its share of the LLCs assets within the next several months and as such, the
investment balance of $34 million has been reclassified to Other Current
Assets as of December31, 2005. IBS/HATV LLC was owned 499% by HTV and
501% by Internet Broadcasting. Controlled and managed by Internet
Broadcasting, IBS/HATV LLC was the parent company of 26 wholly-owned subsidiary
limited liability companies established to own and operate the Internet sites
for each of the Companys television stations. As a result of the restructuring, those 26
subsidiaries were also dissolved and their assets are being transferred to the
Company. Prior to the restructuring, we accounted for our investment in
IBS/HATV LLC using the equity method. Investment in Ripe Digital Entertainment,Inc.
On July27, 2005, the Company invested approximately $5 million in Ripe
Digital Entertainment,Inc. Ripe TV representing a 3125% interest. Ripe
TV was formed in 2003 to start an advertising-supported free digital
video-on-demand program service. Launched in October2005, the program
service targets men aged 18-34 and is available for distribution via multiple
platforms, including digital cable, broadband and cell phones. We account for
this investment using the equity method. Investment in USDTV.
On September23, 2005, the Company and Hearst each invested approximately
$15 million in USDTV, representing a combined 10% interest. In addition, on January27,
2006, the Company and Hearst each invested approximately $1 million in USDTV
representing a total combined 1235% interest. USDTV was formed to provide a
national digital subscription-based television programming distribution service
using portions of the digital television spectrum. Currently, the program
service which consists of local television signals combined with the most
popular cable networks, is available in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Las Vegas,
Nevada, Salt Lake City, Utah and Dallas, Texas. We account for this investment
using the cost method. Investment
in NBC/Hearst-Argyle Syndication, LLC. Effective December31, 2005, NBC and the Company
concluded the NBC/Hearst-Argyle syndication venture and the Company recorded a
loss of $25 million within Other expense. The Companys 20% share in the
results of NBC/Hearst-Argyle Syndication, LLC is included in Equity in income
loss of affiliates, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income
for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003. We accounted for this
investment using the equity method. Investment
in ProAct Technologies Corporation. During the year ended December31, 2004, the
Company recorded a $37 million write-down to net realizable value of the
Companys investment in ProAct Technologies Corporation ProAct. In December2004,
ProAct sold its assets to a third party as partof an overall plan of
liquidation. The Company received $05 million in distributions from ProAct
during the year ended December31, 2005. Investment
in Capital Trust. On December20,
2001, the Company purchased all of the Capital Trusts common stock valued at
$62 million as partof the initial capitalization of the Capital Trust,
and the Company received $2000 million in connection with the issuance of the
Subordinated Debentures valued at $2062 million to the Capital Trust. The
Subordinated Debentures are presented as Note payable to Capital Trust in the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Capital Trust does not hold any
other significant assets other than note receivable from the Company for the Subordinated Debentures. In
accordance with the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company does not consolidate
the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Capital Trust, in its
consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we account for this investment
using the equity method. The only earnings attributable to this investment are
the Companys interest payments made on $62 million portion of the Subordinated
Debentures. The Company has recorded its share in the earnings of the Capital
Trust as an offset to the interest expense that the Company pays on the
Subordinated Debentures see Note 7. On
December31, 2004, the Company redeemed a portion of the subordinated
debentures valued at $722 million and the Capital Trust concurrently
redeemed $22 million of its common stock and $700 million of preferred
securities. 52 Acquisition
of WMTW. On July1, 2004, the
Company acquired the television broadcast assets of WMTW-TV, Channel 8, the ABC
affiliate serving the Portland-Auburn, Maine television market, for
approximately $381 million in cash, inclusive of acquisition costs. This
acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination and the
pro-forma results of operations and related per share information have not been
presented as the amounts are considered immaterial. Investment
in NBC Weather Plus. In November2004, NBC Weather Plus
Network Weather Plus was formed to launch the first digital local and
national weather network using a portion of the digital spectrum of
NBC-affiliated television stations.
Weather Plus is a 50/50 joint venture between two member limited
liability companies: NBC News Bureaus,Inc.
and Weather Network Affiliates Company, LLC.
NBC-affiliated stations may participate in the venture by investing in
Weather Network Affiliates Company, LLC.
We have a minority interest in Weather Network Affiliates Company, LLC,
and have launched NBC Weather Plus in eight of our markets Sacramento,
Orlando, Winston-Salem, Greenville, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Lancaster and New
Orleans and expect to launch Weather Plus in our two remaining NBC markets in
2006. We account for this investment
using the cost method. Other
Investments. The
majority of the other investments are broadcast tower partnerships. 4. Goodwill and Intangible

In accordance with SFAS 142,
Goodwill and Intangible Assets, SFAS
142 the Company assesses its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives at least annually by applying a fair value-based test. The Companys intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives are licenses to operate its television stations which
have been granted by the FCC. SFAS 142
also requires that intangible assets with determinable useful lives be
amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated
residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. In performing the annual
impairment test, the estimated fair value of each stations FCC license and
enterprise value is determined based on the present value of future cash
flows. When performing the annual
impairment test in 2005, we determined that at our station, WDSU-TV in New
Orleans, Lousiana, the aggregate book value of FCC licenses exceeded the
estimated fair value by $262 million and the Company wrote down the book value
of FCC licenses accordingly. After
reducing the carrying value of the FCC license, the Company compared the
carrying value of WDSU-TVs net assets to its enterprise value. As a result, the Company wrote down $30
million of goodwill. Estimates of future
cash flows reflected the negative impact of Hurricane Katrina on the New
Orleans market. The Company, as an FCC
licensee, enjoys an expectancy of continued renewal of its licenses, so long as
it continues to provide service in the public interest. The FCC has historically renewed the Companys
licenses in the ordinary course of business, without compelling challenge and
at little cost to the Company.
Furthermore, the Company believes that over-the-air broadcasting will
continue as a video distribution mode for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the cash flows derived from the
Companys FCC licenses are expected to continue indefinitely and as such, and
in accordance with SFAS 142, the life of the FCC license intangible asset is
deemed to be indefinite. 53 Summarized below are the
carrying value and accumulated amortization of intangible assets that continue
to be amortized under SFAS 142, as well as the carrying value of those
intangible assets that are no longer amortized and goodwill as of December31,

Credit Facility On April15, 2005, we
entered into a five year $250 million credit facility with a consortium of
banks led by JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wachovia Bank, BNP Paribas and
Harris Nesbitt. The new credit facility
can be used for general corporate purposes including working capital,
investments, acquisitions, debt repayment and dividend payments. On the same day, we capitalized $11 million
of costs related to the credit facility.
Outstanding principal balances under the credit facility will 54 bear interest at our option at LIBOR or the
alternate base rate ABR, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin for ABR loans is
zero. The applicable margin for LIBOR
loans varies between 050% and 100% depending on the ratio of our total debt
to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined by
the credit agreement the Leverage Ratio.
The ABR is the greater of ithe prime rate or iithe
Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect plus 05%. We are required to pay a commitment fee based
on the unused portion of the Credit Facility.
The commitment fee ranges from 015% to 025% depending on our Leverage
Ratio. The credit facility is a general
unsecured obligation of the Company. We
have not borrowed under this credit facility as of December31, 2005. During 2003, we repaid, in full, $91 million
outstanding under our then $750 million senior credit facility which had an
effective interest rate of 38%. Senior Notes At December31,
2005, the Senior Notes, which are unsecured obligations, consisted of $125
million principal amount of 70% senior notes due 2007; $176 million principal
amount of 70% senior notes due 2018 and $1161 million principal amount of
75% senior notes due 2027. At December31, 2004, the Senior Notes, which
are unsecured obligations, consisted of $125 million principal amount of 70%
senior notes due 2007; $176 million principal amount of 70% senior notes due
2018 and $1311 million principal amount of 75% senior notes due 2027.
Initially issued in November1997 and January1998, proceeds from the
senior notes were used to repay then existing debt. On December13, 2005, we
repurchased at a premium $15 million of our 75% senior notes due 2027. Private Placement Debt The Private
Placement Debt consists of $450 million in senior, unsecured notes, which bear
interest at 718% per year. The notes
are repayable in five mandatory $90 million annual installments beginning on December1,
2006. The Notes were initially issued in
connection with the January1, 1999 acquisition of KCRA-TV in Sacramento,
California. Capital Lease Obligations We have capitalized the
future minimum lease payments of equipment under leases that qualify as capital
leases. We had capital lease obligations of approximately $01 million and $03
million as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The capital leases have terms which expire in
various years through 2008. Aggregate Maturities of Total Debt Approximate aggregate annual

7. Note Payable to Capital
Trust On December20, 2001,
our wholly-owned unconsolidated subsidiary trust, the Capital Trust, completed
a $2000 million private placement of Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Securities with institutional investors.
We then issued subordinated debentures of $2062 million the Subordinated
Debentures to the Capital Trust in exchange for $2000 million in net
proceeds from the private placement and 100% of the Capital Trusts common
stock, valued at $62 million. The Subordinated Debentures are presented as
Note payable to Capital Trust in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We paid the
Capital Trusts issuance costs of $52 million, resulting in net proceeds to us
of $1948 million. We utilized the net proceeds to reduce outstanding
borrowings under the Credit Facility. In connection with the
private placement, the Capital Trust issued 1,400,000 shares of SeriesA
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities due 2016 liquidation preference
$50 per redeemable convertible preferred security for an aggregate of $70,000,000,
and 2,600,000 shares of SeriesB Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Securities due 2021 liquidation preference $50 per redeemable convertible
preferred security for an aggregate of $130,000,000, to institutional
investors. Hereafter, the SeriesA and the SeriesB Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Securities are together referred to as the Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Securities. The investor group included Hearst
Broadcasting,Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hearst. Hearst
Broadcasting,Inc. purchased an aggregate of 300,000 shares of the SeriesA
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities and an aggregate of 500,000 shares
of the SeriesB Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities for a total of
$40 million, or 20% of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities. As the parent company of the Capital Trust,
we have made a full and unconditional guarantee of the Capital Trusts payments
on the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities see Note 15. As part of the transaction,
we issued and sold to the Capital Trust, in exchange for the proceeds from the
sale of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities, $72,164,960 in
aggregate principal amount of 75% convertible junior subordinated deferrable
interest debentures SeriesA, due 2016 the SeriesA Debentures
and $134,020,640 in aggregate principal amount of 75% convertible junior
subordinated deferrable interest debentures SeriesB, due 2021 the SeriesB
Debentures. Hereafter, the SeriesA and the SeriesB Debentures
are together referred to as the Debentures.
The Debentures issued to the Capital Trust by us, in the combined
aggregate principal amount of $206,185,600 were issued in exchange for ithe
receipt of the proceeds of $2000 million from the issuance of the Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Securities; and ii$6,185,600 which was owed by us
to the Capital Trust for our purchase of $6,185,600 of the Capital Trusts
common stock, as part of the initial capitalization of the Capital Trust see
Note 3. The Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities issued by the Capital Trust are effectively convertible,
at the option of the holder at any time, into shares of the Companys SeriesA
Common Stock, par value $0l per share through an exchange of such Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities for a portion of the Debentures of the corresponding
series held by the Capital Trust. The conversion terms are identical for all
holders of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities, including Hearst.
The SeriesA Debentures are convertible into the Companys Common Stock at
an initial rate of 2005133 shares of the Companys Common Stock per $50
principal amount of SeriesA Debentures equivalent to a conversion price
of $249360 per share of the Companys Common Stock and the SeriesB
Debentures are convertible into the Companys Common Stock at an initial rate
of 1972262 shares of the Companys Common Stock per $50 principal amount of SeriesB
Debentures equivalent to a conversion price of $253516 per share of the
Companys Common Stock. When the Debentures are repaid or redeemed, the same
amount of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities will simultaneously be
redeemed with the proceeds from the repayment or redemption of the Debentures.
The SeriesA Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities mature on December31,
2016 with distributions payable thereon at a rate of 75% per year. The SeriesB
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities mature on December31, 2021
with distributions payable thereon at a rate of 75% per year. 56 The SeriesA Debentures
mature on December31, 2016 and bear interest at a rate of 75% per year.
The SeriesB Debentures mature on December31, 2021 and bear interest
at a rate of 75% per year. The Company has the right to defer interest on the
Debentures and therefore distributions on the Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Securities by extending the interest payment period from time to time in
accordance with and subject to the terms of the Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities. Further, the SeriesA Debentures may be redeemed at
the option of the Company or at the direction of Hearst at any time on or
after December31, 2004 and the SeriesB Debentures may be redeemed
at the option of the Company or at the direction of Hearst at any time on or
after December31, 2006. The redemption prices per $50 principal amount
of the SeriesA Debentures range from $52625 in 2005, declining to
$50375 in 2011 and $50 thereafter to maturity. The redemption prices per $50
principal amount of the SeriesB Debentures range from $51875 in 2007,
declining to $50375 in 2011 and $50 thereafter to maturity. The Company redeemed all of
its outstanding SeriesA Debentures on December31, 2004 the Redemption
Date, at a price of $52625 per $5000 principal amount of the SeriesA
Debentures in accordance with the terms of the indenture. The redemption of the
SeriesA Debentures triggered a simultaneous redemption by the Capital
Trust of 14 million shares of its SeriesA Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities. Also, the Capital
Trust redeemed 43,299 shares of its common stock, held by the Company. As a result of the redemption, Notes payable
to Capital Trust was reduced by $722 million and Investments was reduced by
$22 million. Interest Expense, net Capital
Trust During the year ended December31,
2005, Interest expense, net Capital Trust represents interest expense
incurred by the Company on $1340 million of Debentures issued by its wholly
owned unconsolidated subsidiary trust the Capital Trust. For the years ended December31, 2004
and 2003, the Company incurred interest expense on $2062 million of Debentures
issued by the Capital Trust. Interest expense, net in 2004 includes a $37
million premium paid for the redemption of the SeriesA Debentures. Interest paid by the Company to the Capital
Trust was then utilized by the Capital Trust to make dividend payments to the
holders of the $2000 million of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities
issued by the Capital Trust in December2001. In accordance with FIN
46R, the Company does not consolidate the accounts of the Capital Trust in
its consolidated financial statements. The Company uses the equity method of
accounting to record the parent companys equity interest in the earnings of
the Capital Trust and accordingly has included such earnings of $03 million 05 million, and $05 million in Interest Expense, net Capital Trust in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

for each period is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. The
calculation of dilutive EPS for each period is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the effect, if any,
of dilutive common stock equivalent shares.
The following tables set forth a reconciliation between basic EPS and
diluted EPS, in accordance with SFAS 128, Earnings
Per Share. See Note 2 under Earnings Per Share EPS. 57

The following shares were
not included in the computation of diluted EPS, because to do so would have
been anti-dilutive for the periods presented: i5,781 shares of SeriesA
Preferred Stock, outstanding as of December31, 2004, and 7,381 shares of SeriesA
Preferred Stock, outstanding as of December31, 2003, which are
convertible into SeriesA Common Stock see Note 11; and ii5,470
shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock, outstanding as of December31,
2004, and 10,938 shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock, outstanding as of December31,
2003, which are convertible into SeriesA Common Stock see Note 11. The
dividends for the SeriesA and B Preferred Stock were deducted from Net
income for the calculation of Basic and Diluted EPS. These shares were redeemed
in full as of January1, 2005. The dilution test for the
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities related to the Capital Trust is
performed for all periods. This test considers only the total number of shares
that could be issued if converted and does not consider either the conversion
price or the share price of the underlying common shares. For the year ended December31,
2005, 5,128,205 shares of SeriesA Common Stock to be issued upon the
conversion of 2,600,000 shares of SeriesB 75% Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Securities, related to the Capital Trust, are not included in the number of
common shares used in the calculation of diluted EPS because to do so would
have been anti-dilutive. The SeriesA Convertible Preferred Securities
were redeemed on December31, 2004 and therefore had no impact on the 2005
periods. When the securities related to the Capital Trust are dilutive, the
interest, net of tax, related to the Capital Trust is added back to Income
applicable to common stockholders for purposes of the diluted EPS calculation.
For the year ended December31, 2004, 7,935,068 shares of SeriesA
Common Stock to be issued upon the conversion of 1,400,000 shares of SeriesA
75% Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities and 2,600,000 shares of SeriesB
75% Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities, related to the Capital Trust,
are included in the number of common shares used in the calculation of diluted
EPS. For the year ended December31, 2003, these shares were not included
in the computation of diluted EPS because to do so would have been
anti-dilutive. Common stock options for
3,657,174, 2,916,270 and 2,902,456 shares of SeriesA Common Stock before
application of the treasury stock method, outstanding as of December31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because the exercise price was greater than the average market
price of the common shares during the calculation period. 9. Income Taxes The benefit provision for
income taxes relating to income for the years ended December31, 2005,

The Companys effective
income tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially
impacted by changes in the level of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, changes in
the expected outcome of tax examinations, amount of deductions or changes in
the deferred tax valuation allowance. The effective income tax rate for the
years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 varied from the statutory

The decrease in our Federal
current tax expense and effective tax rate for the year ended December31,
2005, primarily relates to our agreement in June2005 with the Internal
Revenue Service IRS to settle certain examination matters for tax years 2001-2002,
principally related to deductions of income tax basis associated with certain
of our prior acquisitions. The settlement resulted in our recognition of $319
million of reduced current income tax expense in 2005. The decrease in our State deferred tax
expense and effective tax rate for the year ended December31, 2005,
primarily relates to the change in Ohio tax law in June2005, which among
numerous other provisions calls for the phase-out of the corporate income tax
in Ohio, resulting in the Companys reversal of $84 million net $55 million
in previously recorded State deferred tax liabilities. The increase in other non-deductible business
expenses is primarily related to the goodwill write-down associated with the
New Orleans market impairment charge, which provided no tax benefit. Deferred income tax
liabilities and assets at December31, 2005 and 2004 consisted of the

The deferred tax liabilities
primarily relate to differences between book and tax basis of the Companys FCC
licenses. In accordance with the adoption of SFAS 142 on January1, 2002,
the Company no longer amortizes its FCC licenses, but instead tests them for
impairment annually. As the tax basis in
the Companys FCC licenses continues to amortize, the deferred tax liabilities
will increase over time. 59 The valuation allowance
represents the uncertainty associated with the realization of the tax benefits
of certain state net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $319
million, which expire between 2006 and 2025, and other capital loss
carryforwards totaling approximately $22 million, which expire in 2009. The 2005 change in the valuation allowance is
primarily the result of the valuation allowance associated with the capital
loss carryforwards. 10. Common Stock General The Company has authorized
300 million common shares, par value $001 per share, which includes 200
million of SeriesA Common Stock and 100 million SeriesB Common
Stock. Except as otherwise described
below, the issued and outstanding shares of SeriesA Common Stock and SeriesB
Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote
of stockholders, with each issued and outstanding share of SeriesA Common
Stock and SeriesB Common Stock entitling the holder thereof to one vote
on all such matters. With respect to any election of directors, ithe
holders of the shares of SeriesA Common Stock are entitled to vote
separately as a class to elect two members of the Companys Board of Directors
the SeriesA Directors and iithe holders of the shares of the
Companys SeriesB Common Stock are entitled to vote separately as a class
to elect the balance of the Companys Board of Directors the SeriesB
Directors; provided, however, that the number of SeriesB Directors shall
not constitute less than a majority of the Companys Board of Directors. All of the outstanding
shares of SeriesB Common Stock are held by a subsidiary of Hearst. No holder of shares of SeriesB Common
Stock may transfer any such shares to any person other than to iHearst;
iiany corporation into which Hearst is merged or consolidated; iiiany
entity to which all or substantially all of Hearsts assets are transferred; or
ivany entity controlled by Hearst each a Permitted Transferee. SeriesB Common Stock, however, may be
converted at any time into SeriesA Common Stock and freely transferred,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation and to applicable securities laws limitations. Common Stock Repurchase In May1998 the Companys
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of its
outstanding SeriesA Common Stock.
Such repurchases may be effected from time to time in the open market or
in private transactions, subject to market conditions and managements
discretion. During 2005, the Company repurchased 669,227 shares of SeriesA
Common Stock at a cost of $164 million and an average per share price of
$2448. Between May1998 and December31,
2005, the Company repurchased approximately 43 million shares of SeriesA
Common Stock at a cost of approximately $1080 million and an average price of
$2497. There can be no assurance that
such repurchases will occur in the future or, if they do occur, what the terms
of such repurchases will be. Hearst and its
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Hearst Broadcasting,Inc. Hearst
Broadcasting is authorized to purchase up to 25 million shares of the
Companys SeriesA Common Stock from time to time in the open market, in
private transactions or otherwise. As of December31, 2005, under this
plan Hearst had purchased approximately 204 million shares of the Companys
outstanding SeriesA Common Stock. Hearsts ownership in the Company was
705% and 676% as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Common Stock Dividends During the year ended December31,

11. Preferred Stock The Company has one million
shares of authorized preferred stock, par value $01 per share. Under the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation, the Company has two authorized series
of preferred stock, SeriesA Preferred Stock and SeriesB 60 Preferred Stock collectively, the Preferred Stock. At December31, 2005, there is no
Preferred Stock outstanding. There were 5,470 shares of SeriesB Preferred
Stock and 5,781 shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
as of December31, 2004. The Preferred Stock had a cash dividend feature
whereby each share accrued $65 per share annually, to be paid quarterly. On January1, 2004, the
Company redeemed 1,600 shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock and on December10,
2004, the Company redeemed 5,468 shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock. On January1, 2005, 5,781 shares of SeriesA
Preferred Stock and 5,470 shares of SeriesB Preferred Stock were

Companys stockholders and Board of Directors approved the 2004 Long Term
Incentive Compensation Plan Incentive Compensation Plan. The Incentive Compensation Plan is intended to
replace the Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan
and all grants made after May5, 2004 are made under the new Incentive
Compensation Plan. Under the Incentive
Compensation Plan the Company may award various forms of incentive compensation
to officers, other key employees and non-employee directors of the Company and
its subsidiaries. The Company reserved
for issuance under the Incentive Compensation Plan 36 million shares of SeriesA
Common Stock. Generally, under the
Incentive Compensation Plan stock options are granted with exercise prices
equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Each option is exercisable after the period
or periods specified in the applicable option agreement, but no option can be
exercised after the expiration of 10 years from the date of grant. Generally, options we have granted to
employees under the Incentive Compensation Plan cliff-vest after three years
commencing on the effective date of the grant. Under the Stock Option Plan,
87 million shares of SeriesA Common Stock were reserved for
issuance. Under the Stock Option Plan,
stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of grant.
Generally, options granted prior to December2000 either icliff-vest

As of December31,
2005, the Company has reserved 1,138,450 shares of SeriesA Common Stock
for future grants under the Incentive Compensation Plan. The Company accounts for
employee stock-based compensation under APB 25 and related interpretations.
Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the Companys employee stock
options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant,
no compensation expense is recognized. Pro forma information
regarding Net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS No123
and has been determined as if the Company had recognized compensation expense
for its employee stock options. Under
SFAS No123, options are valued at their date of grant and then expensed
over their vesting period. The value of
the Companys options was calculated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model for options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
The weighted average value of options granted was $763, $781 and $871 for
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The following assumptions were used for the

Compensation for the pro forma effect on Net income and earnings per share had
compensation expense been recorded under SFAS No123, as amended. 13. Stock Purchase Plan In April1999, we
implemented a non-compensatory employee stock purchase plan ESPP in
accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section423. The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares
of our SeriesA Common Stock, at 85% of its market price, through
after-tax payroll deductions. We
reserved and made available for issuance and purchases under the Stock Purchase
Plan 5,000,000 shares of SeriesA Common Stock. Employees purchased 102,934 and 92,259 shares
for aggregate proceeds of approximately $22 million and $20 million in the

SeriesA Common Stock and 100% of our SeriesB Common Stock,
representing in the aggregate approximately 705% of the outstanding voting
power of our common stock, except with regard to the election of
directors. With regard to the election
of directors, Hearsts beneficial ownership of our SeriesB Common Stock
entitles Hearst to elect as a class 11 of the 13 directors of our Board of
Directors. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we
entered into the following transactions with Hearst or parties related to

Pursuant to the Management Agreement, we provide certain management services,
such as sales, news, programming, and financial and accounting management
services, with respect to certain Hearst owned or operated television and radio

would not be available from third parties. Services Agreement.We
incurred expenses of approximately $48 million, $38 million and $37 million
in the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,

Pursuant to the Services Agreement, Hearst provides the Company certain administrative
services such as accounting, financial, legal, insurance, data processing, and

both parties; however, there can be no assurance that more favorable terms
would not be available from third parties. Interest Expense, Net Capital Trust. We
incurred interest expense, net, relating to the Subordinated Debentures issued

stock issued by the Company, and pari passu
with any guarantee of the Company in respect of any preferred stock of the
Company or any preferred security of any of the Companys controlled
affiliates; and iii senior to the Companys Common Stock. The Company made

Post-Retirement Benefits Overview The Company maintains seven defined
benefit pension plans, 12 employee savings plans, and other post-retirement
benefit plans for active, retired and former employees. In addition, the Company participates in a
multi-employer union pension plan that provides retirement benefits to certain
union employees. The seven defined
benefit pension plans are hereafter collectively referred to as the Pension
Plans. Pension Plans and Other
Post-Retirement Benefits Benefits under the Pension
Plans are generally based on years of credited service, age at retirement and
average of the highest five consecutive years compensation. The cost of the
Pension Plans is computed on the basis of the Project Unit Credit Actuarial
Cost Method. Past service cost is amortized over the expected future service
periods of the employees. Pension Plan Assets The Pension Plans weighted
average asset allocations as of the measurement dates September30, 2005
and 2004, by asset category, are as follows

The assets of the Pension
Plans are invested with the objective of being able to meet current and future
benefit payment needs while controlling pension expense volatility. Plan assets are invested with a number of
investment managers and are diversified among equities, fixed income, real
estate and other investments, as shown in the table above. Approximately 80% of
the assets of the Pension Plans are invested in a master trust, which has a
target allocation of approximately 70% equities and 30% fixed income. When adding the remaining 20% of the assets
of the Pension Plans which are outside of the master trust, the aggregate
allocation is comparable to that of the master trust, but with a slightly
higher allocation percentage for fixed income investments. Each of the Pension Plans employs active
investment management programs, and each has an Investment Committee which
reviews the respective plans asset allocation on a periodic basis and
determines when and how to re-balance the portfolio when appropriate. None of
the Pension Plans has any dedicated target allocation to the Companys Common
Stock. Net Periodic Pension and

To develop the expected
long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Company considered the
current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily
government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the
other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations
for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the
aggregate target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of
return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The expected rate of return assumption is then adjusted to reflect
investment and trading expenses. Since
the Companys investment policy is to actively manage certain asset classes
where the potential exists to outperform the broader market, the expected
returns for those asset classes were adjusted to reflect the expected
additional returns. The Company reviews
the expected long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revises it as
appropriate. The weighted-average
assumptions used for computing the projected benefit obligation for the Companys
post-retirement benefit plan as of the measurement dates of September30,
2005 and 2004 are as follows

For measurement purposes,
the Company assumed a per capita health care benefit cost trend rate of 103%
and 110% for persons retiring before and after age 65, respectively. These rates are assumed to decrease gradually
to 5% in 2013 and remain level thereafter.
A PartD Subsidy trend rate of 12% was assumed for the
Company. These rates are assumed to
decrease gradually to 5% in 2013 and remain level thereafter. Previously, a trend rate of 120% in per
capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2004. These rates are assumed to decrease gradually
to 5% by 2013 and remain at that level thereafter. The assumed health care cost
trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health
care plan. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates
would have the following effects

Savings Plans The Companys qualified
employees may contribute from 2% to 16% of their compensation up to certain
dollar limits to self-directed 401k savings plans. In certain of the Companys
but not all 401k savings plans, the Company matches in cash, one-half of
the employee contribution up to 6% i.e. the Company matches up to 3% of the
employees compensation. The assets in the 401k savings plans are invested in
a variety of diversified mutual funds. The Company contributions to the 401k
savings plans in the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
approximately $27 million, $25 million and $24 million, respectively. Multi-Employer Pension Plan The Company participates in
a multi-employer pension plan for providing retirement benefits to certain
union employees. The Companys
contributions to the multiemployer union pension plan in the year ended December31,
2005, was $08 million, $08 million and $07 million in the years ended December31,
2004 and 2003. No information is
available for each of the other contributing employers for this plan. 17. Fair Value of Financial

The fair values of the
Senior Notes were determined based on the quoted market prices and the fair
values of the Private Placement Debt and the Note Payable to Capital Trust were
determined using quoted market prices on comparable debt instruments. For instruments including
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other debt
the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments. In accordance with the requirements of SFAS No107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, the Company believes it is not practicable to estimate
the current fair value of the related party receivables and related party
payables because of the related party nature of the transactions. 69 18. Quarterly Information

b Per common share amounts for the quarters and
the full years have each been calculated separately. Accordingly, quarterly
amounts may not add to the annual amounts because of differences in the average
common shares outstanding during each period and, with regard to diluted per
common share amounts only, because of the inclusion of the effect of
potentially dilutive securities only in the periods in which such effect would
have been dilutive.
