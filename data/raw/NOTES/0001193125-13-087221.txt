Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our
current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to inaccurate assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those identified in
Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and Information below and in Item1A. Risk Factors. 
Introduction We are a leading provider of specialty contracting services, offering infrastructure solutions primarily to the electric power and natural gas and oil pipeline industries in North America and in select
international markets. The services we provide include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of infrastructure within each of the industries we serve, such as electric power transmission and distribution networks, substation
facilities, renewable energy facilities and pipeline transmission and distribution systems and facilities. We also own fiber optic telecommunications infrastructure in select markets and license the right to use these point-to-point fiber optic
telecommunications facilities to customers. We report our results under three reportable segments:
1Electric Power Infrastructure Services, 2Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services and 3Fiber Optic Licensing and Other. This structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our services. Our consolidated
revenues for the year ended December31, 2012 were approximately $592 billion, of which 71% was attributable to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment, 26% to the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment and 3% to
the Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment. Our customers include many of the leading companies in the
industries we serve. We have developed strong strategic alliances with numerous customers and strive to develop and maintain our status as a preferred vendor to our customers. We enter into various types of contracts, including competitive unit
price, hourly rate, cost-plus or time and materials basis, and fixed price or lump sum basis, the final terms and prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer. Although the terms of our contracts vary considerably, most are made on
either a unit price or fixed price basis in which we agree to do the work for a price per unit of work performed unit price or for a fixed amount for the entire project fixed price. We complete a substantial majority of our fixed price projects,
other than certain large transmission projects, within one year, while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open-ended unit price or cost-plus master service agreements that are renewable periodically. 
We recognize revenue on our unit price and cost-plus contracts as units are completed or services are performed. For our
fixed price contracts, we record revenues as work on the contract progresses on a percentage-of-completion basis. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs
to complete the contract. Fixed price contracts generally include retainage provisions under which a percentage of the contract price is withheld until the project is complete and has been accepted by our customer. 
For internal management purposes, we are organized into three internal divisions, namely, the electric power division,
the natural gas and pipeline division and the fiber optic licensing division. These internal divisions are closely aligned with the reportable segments described above based on the predominant type of work provided by the operating units within each
division. Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is
gathered from each operating unit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of our market strategies. These classifications of our operating unit revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at times

Index to Financial Statements
require judgment on the part of management. Our operating units may perform joint infrastructure service projects for customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple types of infrastructure
services under a single customer contract or provide services across industries, for example, joint trenching projects to install distribution lines for electric power and natural gas customers. Our integrated operations and common administrative
support at each of our operating units requires that certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, indirect operating expenses including depreciation, and general and administrative costs, be made
to determine operating segment profitability. Corporate costs, such as payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization related to certain intangible assets are not allocated.
The Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers in
the electric power industry. Services performed by the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution networks and substation
facilities along with other engineering and technical services. This segment also provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of infrastructure damaged by inclement weather, the energized installation, maintenance and upgrade of
electric power infrastructure utilizing unique bare hand and hot stick methods and our proprietary robotic arm technologies, and the installation of smart grid technologies on electric power networks. In addition, this segment designs,
installs and maintains renewable energy generation facilities, in particular solar and wind, and related switchyards and transmission networks. To a lesser extent, this segment provides services such as the design, installation, maintenance and
repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic networks and the installation of cable and control systems for light rail lines. The Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment provides comprehensive network solutions to customers involved in the transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products. Services
performed by the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment generally include the design, installation, repair and maintenance of pipeline transmission and distribution systems, gathering systems and compressor and pump stations, as
well as related trenching, directional boring and automatic welding services. In addition, this segments services include pipeline protection, integrity testing, rehabilitation and replacement, and fabrication of pipeline support systems and
related structures and facilities. To a lesser extent, this segment designs, installs and maintains airport fueling systems as well as water and sewer infrastructure. 
The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment designs, procures, constructs, maintains and owns fiber optic
telecommunications infrastructure in select markets and licenses the right to use these point-to-point fiber optic telecommunications facilities to our customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five years,
inclusive of certain renewal options. Under those agreements, customers are provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic network, with the network owned and maintained by us. The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment
provides services to enterprise, education, carrier, financial services and healthcare customers, as well as other entities with high bandwidth telecommunication needs. The telecommunication services provided through this segment are subject to
regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and certain state public utility commissions. The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment also provides various telecommunication infrastructure services on a limited and ancillary basis, primarily
to our customers in the electric power industry. Recent Investments, Acquisitions and Divestitures 
On December3, 2012, substantially all of Quantas domestic telecommunications infrastructure services
operations and related subsidiaries were sold to Dycom Industries, Inc. for net proceeds of approximately $2650 million. In the first and second quarters of 2012, we acquired four businesses, which included one electric power infrastructure services company based in Canada, two electric power infrastructure services
companies based in the United States and one natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services company based in the United States. 
37 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
These businesses have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of
approximately $575 million in cash, 1,927,113shares of our common stock valued at approximately $373 million and the repayment of $110 million in debt. These acquisitions allow us to further expand our capabilities and scope of services
internationally and in the United States. The financial results of these businesses are generally included in the corresponding segment. In the third and fourth quarters of 2011, we acquired five businesses, which included three electric power infrastructure services companies based in Canada, one electric power infrastructure services
company based in the United States and one natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services company based in Australia. These businesses have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. The
aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $808 million in cash, 1,939,813shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately $324 million and the repayment of $34 million in debt. These acquisitions allow
us to further expand our capabilities and scope of services internationally and in the United States. The financial results of these businesses are generally included in the corresponding segment. 
On June22, 2011, we acquired an equity ownership interest of approximately 39% in Howard Midstream Energy Partners,
LLC HEP for an initial capital contribution of $350 million. HEP is engaged in the business of owning, operating and constructing midstream plant and pipeline assets in the natural gas and oil pipeline industry. HEP commenced operations in June
2011 with the acquisitions of Texas Pipeline LLC, a pipeline operator in the Eagle Ford shale region of South Texas, and Bottom Line Services, LLC, a construction services company. Our investment in HEP is expected to provide strategic growth
opportunities in the ongoing development of the Texas Eagle Ford shale region. We contributed an additional $523 million in the aggregate to HEP in March and April 2012 in exchange for an aggregate 45,435 Class D units of HEP. Howard Midstream
Energy Partners, LLC used the proceeds of our investment, along with capital contributed by other third party investors, to purchase additional pipeline assets in the Eagle Ford shale region. As a result of this transaction and other third party
investments in HEP, our total equity ownership interest in HEP decreased from approximately 39% at March31, 2012 to approximately 31%. We account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. During the fourth quarter of 2012, HEP
sold its interest in Bottom Line Services, LLC and is expected to use the proceeds from the transaction for other strategic development opportunities. On October25, 2010, we acquired Valard Construction LP and certain of its affiliated entities Valard, an electric power infrastructure services company based in Alberta, Canada. This acquisition
allowed us to further expand our electric power infrastructure capabilities and scope of services in Canada. Because of the type of work performed by Valard, its financial results are generally included in the Electric Power Infrastructure Services
segment. The results of Valard have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on October25, 2010. 
Seasonality; Fluctuations of Results; Economic Conditions Our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project timing and
schedules, and holidays. Typically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions can cause delays on projects. In addition, many of our customers develop their capital budgets for the coming year
during the first quarter and do not begin infrastructure projects in a meaningful way until their capital budgets are finalized. Second quarter revenues are typically higher than those in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but continued cold
and wet weather can often impact second quarter productivity. Third quarter revenues are typically the highest of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway, and weather is more accommodating. Generally, revenues during the fourth
quarter of the year are lower than the third quarter but higher than the second quarter. Many projects are completed in the fourth quarter, and revenues are often impacted positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budgets before the end
of the year; however, the holiday season and inclement weather can sometimes cause delays, reducing revenues and increasing costs. Any 
38 Table of Contents

quarter may be positively or negatively affected by atypical weather patterns in a given part of the country, such as severe weather, excessive rainfall or warmer winter weather, making it
difficult to predict these variations and their effect on particular projects quarter to quarter. 
Additionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. As a result, our volume of business may be adversely affected by
declines or delays in new projects in various geographic regions in the United States and Canada. Project schedules, particularly in connection with larger, longer-term projects, can also create fluctuations in the services provided, which may
adversely affect us in a given period. The financial condition of our customers and their access to capital, variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular period, regional, national and global economic and market conditions,
timing of acquisitions, the timing and magnitude of acquisition and integration costs associated with acquisitions, dispositions, fluctuations in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and interest rate fluctuations are examples of
items that may also materially affect quarterly results. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period. 
We and our customers continue to operate in an uncertain business environment, with heightened regulatory and
environmental requirements, stringent permitting processes and only gradual recovery in the economy from recessionary levels. We are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market conditions have had or may have
on them. Certain of our customers have reduced or delayed spending over the past three years, which we attribute primarily to regulatory and permitting hurdles and negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these issues may
continue to affect demand for some of our services in the near-term. However, we believe that most of our customers, many of whom are regulated utilities, remain financially stable in general and will be able to continue with their business plans in
the long-term. You should read Outlook and Understanding Margins for additional discussion of trends and challenges that may affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Understanding Margins Our gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues, and our operating margin is operating income expressed as a percentage of revenues. Cost of services, which is subtracted from
revenues to obtain gross profit, consists primarily of salaries, wages and benefits to employees, depreciation, fuel and other equipment expenses, equipment rentals, subcontracted services, insurance, facilities expenses, materials and parts and
supplies. Selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are then subtracted from gross profit to obtain operating income. Various factors some controllable, some not impact our margins on
a quarterly or annual basis. Seasonal and geographical.As discussed
previously, seasonal patterns can have a significant impact on margins. Generally, business is slower in the winter months versus the warmer months of the year, resulting in lower productivity and consequently reducing our ability to cover fixed
costs. This can be offset somewhat by increased demand for electrical service and repair work resulting from severe weather. Additionally, project schedules, including when projects begin and when they are completed, may impact margins. The mix of
business conducted in different parts of the country will also affect margins, as some parts of the country offer the opportunity for higher margins than others due to the geographic characteristics associated with the physical location where the
work is being performed. Such characteristics include whether the project is performed in an urban versus a rural setting or in a mountainous area or in open terrain. Site conditions, including unforeseen underground conditions, can also impact
margins. Weather.Adverse or favorable weather conditions can impact gross
margins in a given period. For example, snow or rainfall in the areas in which we operate may negatively impact our revenues and margins due to reduced productivity, as projects may be delayed or temporarily placed on hold until weather conditions
improve. Conversely, in periods when weather remains dry and temperatures are accommodating, more work can be done, sometimes with less cost, which would have a favorable impact on margins. In some cases, severe weather, such as hurricanes and ice
storms, can provide us with higher margin emergency restoration service work, which generally has a positive impact on margins. 
39 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Revenue mix.The mix of revenues derived from
the industries we serve will impact margins, as certain industries provide higher margin opportunities. Additionally, changes in our customers spending patterns in each of the industries we serve can cause an imbalance in supply and demand
and, therefore, affect margins and mix of revenues by industry served. Service and maintenance versus
installation.Installation work is often performed on a fixed price basis, while maintenance work is often performed under pre-established or negotiated prices or cost-plus pricing arrangements. Margins for installation
work may vary from project to project, and may be higher than maintenance work, as work obtained on a fixed price basis has higher risk than other types of pricing arrangements. We typically derive approximately 30% of our annual revenues from
maintenance work, but a higher portion of installation work in any given period may affect our gross margins for that period. Subcontract work.Work that is subcontracted to other service providers generally yields lower margins. An increase in subcontract work in a given period may contribute to a
decrease in margins. We typically subcontract approximately 20% to 25% of our work to other service providers. 
Materials versus labor.Typically, our customers are responsible for supplying their own
materials on projects; however, for some of our contracts, we may agree to procure all or part of the required materials. Margins may be lower on projects where we furnish a significant amount of materials, as our mark-up on materials is generally
lower than on our labor costs. In a given period, an increase in the percentage of work with higher materials procurement requirements may decrease our overall margins. 
Depreciation.We include depreciation in cost of services. This is common practice in our
industry, but it can make comparability of our margins to those of other companies difficult. This must be taken into consideration when comparing us to other companies. 
Insurance.Margins could be impacted by fluctuations in insurance accruals as additional
claims arise and as circumstances and conditions of existing claims change. We are insured for employers liability, general liability, auto liability and workers compensation claims. Since August1, 2009, all policy deductible
levels are $50 million per occurrence, other than employers liability, which is subject to a deductible of $10 million. We also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of
which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year. Performance
risk.Margins may fluctuate because of the volume of work and the impacts of pricing and job productivity, which can be affected both favorably and negatively by weather, geography, customer decisions and crew
productivity. For example, when comparing a service contract between a current quarter and the comparable prior years quarter, factors affecting the gross margins associated with the revenues generated by the contract may include pricing under
the contract, the volume of work performed under the contract, the mix of the type of work specifically being performed and the productivity of the crews performing the work. Productivity can be influenced by many factors, including where the work
is performed e.g., rural versus urban area or mountainous or rocky area versus open terrain, whether the work is on an open or encumbered right of way, the impacts of inclement weather or the effects of environmental restrictions or
regulatory delays. These types of factors are not practicable to quantify through accounting data, but each of these items may individually or in the aggregate have a direct impact on the gross margin of a specific project. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management, administrative salaries and benefits, marketing, office rent and utilities,
communications, professional fees, bad debt expense, acquisition costs, gains and losses on the sale of property and equipment, letter of credit fees and maintenance, training and conversion costs related to the implementation of an information
technology solution.

Results of Operations 
As previously discussed, we have acquired certain businesses, the results of which have been included in the following
results of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates. Additionally, the results of operations of the telecommunications subsidiaries disposed of on December3, 2012 have been reclassified from continuing operations to income
from discontinued operations for all periods presented. The following table sets forth selected statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of revenues for the years indicated dollars in thousands.

2012 compared to 2011 Revenues.Revenues increased $173 billion, or 412%, to $592 billion for the year ended December31, 2012, primarily due to an increase in the number and size of electric and natural
gas transmission projects as a result of overall increases in capital spending by our customers. Electric power infrastructure services revenues increased $118 billion, or 392%, to $421 billion and natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services
revenues 
41 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
increased $5235 million, or 518%, to $153 billion for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. Also contributing to the overall revenue
increase was the contribution of $2316 million in revenues from acquired businesses and an increase of $772 million in revenues from emergency restoration services during 2012 as compared to 2011. 
Gross profit.Gross profit increased $3760 million, or 669%, to $9377 million for the
year ended December31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to the impact of higher overall revenues earned across all segments during the current period. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 158% for the year ended
December31, 2012 from 134% for the year ended December31, 2011. Contributing to the increase in gross margin from 2011 to 2012 were overall performance improvements across all segments during the year ended December31, 2012. In
addition, the higher revenues earned during the current period also enhanced our ability to cover operating overhead costs. Gross profit for the year ended December31, 2011 was also negatively impacted by a $326 million charge to the Natural
Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segments cost of services which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 in connection with the withdrawal of certain of our subsidiaries from an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses.Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased $971 million, or 287%, to $4349 million for the year ended December31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $500 million in higher salary and benefits costs associated with higher personnel and incentive
compensation expenses as a result of current levels of operating activity and profitability, $147 million in higher professional fees primarily associated with certain legal matters, business development initiatives and ongoing technology
development costs and a $37 million increase in bad debt expense. Also contributing to the overall increase were $175 million in additional administrative expenses associated with acquired companies. Selling, general and administrative expenses as
a percentage of revenues decreased from 81% for the year ended December31, 2011 to 73% for the year ended December31, 2012 primarily due to the impact of higher overall revenues described above. 
Amortization of intangible assets.Amortization of intangible assets increased $87 million
to $377 million for the year ended December31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased amortization of intangibles associated with businesses acquired during 2012 and the end of 2011, partially offset by reduced amortization
expense from previously acquired intangible assets as certain of these assets became fully amortized. 
Interest expense.Interest expense increased $19 million to $37 million for the year
ended December31, 2012, primarily due to higher levels of borrowings under the credit facility during the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011 and increased commitment fees on the credit
facility entered into during the third quarter of 2011. The increased commitment fees are due to higher rates and increased unused availability under the facility. 
Interest income.Interest income increased $04 million to $15 million for the year ended
December31, 2012. The increase is primarily due to higher interest rates earned for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. The increase was partially offset by lower average cash balances
during the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011. Equity
in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was $21 million for the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to none for the year ended December31, 2011. This
primarily relates to our investment in HEP. Provision for income taxes.The
provision for income taxes was $1589 million for the year ended December31, 2012, with an effective tax rate of 342%. The provision for income taxes was $631 million for the year ended December31, 2011, with an effective tax rate of
326%. The effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 were impacted by the recording of tax benefits in the amount of $79 million in 2012 and $84 million in 2011 associated with decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from the
expiration of various federal 
42 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
and state statutes of limitations and settlement of certain tax audits. Excluding the tax benefits from decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions, the effective tax rates would have been
359% and 370% for the years ended December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, respectively. After excluding the tax benefits recorded, the lower effective tax rate in 2012 was primarily due to a higher proportion of income from continuing
operations earned from international jurisdictions which are taxed at lower statutory rates. 2011 compared to 2010 
Revenues.Revenues increased $5643 million, or 155%, to $419 billion for the year ended December31,
2011. Electric power infrastructure services revenues increased $9939 million, or 490%, to $302 billion for the year ended December31, 2011, primarily due to an increase in the number and size of projects as a result of increased capital
spending by our customers, the contribution of $2422 million in revenues from acquired businesses and an increase of $769 million in revenues from emergency restoration services during 2011 as compared to 2010. Partially offsetting these increases
were lower revenues from natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services, which decreased $3816 million, or 274%, to $101 billion for the year ended December31, 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the number and size of natural gas
transmission projects that were ongoing during 2011 as compared to 2010. Fiber optic licensing and other revenues also decreased by $480 million, or 231%, to $1599 million during 2011 primarily due to a long-haul fiber installation performed
during 2010 that was not replaced during 2011. Gross profit.Gross profit
decreased $278 million, or 47%, to $5617 million for the year ended December31, 2011. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin decreased to 134% for the year ended December31, 2011 from 162% for the year ended December31,
2010. These decreases were primarily due to the impact of lower overall revenues from natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services, which resulted in a lower ability to cover operating overhead costs, as well as the impact of project losses
incurred by this segment during 2011 that primarily resulted from increased project costs related to productivity issues caused by adverse weather conditions and more stringent application of regulations. Also contributing to these decreases was the
impact of a $326 million charge to the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segments cost of services in the fourth quarter of 2011 associated with the withdrawal of certain of our subsidiaries from an underfunded multi-employer
pension plan. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by the impact of higher overall revenues from the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment as described above. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses.Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased $300 million, or 97%, to $3378 million for the year ended December31, 2011. This increase was primarily attributable to $192 million in higher salary and benefits costs from increased personnel and incentive compensation expenses
associated with increased levels of operating activity, as well as approximately $140 million in additional administrative expenses associated with businesses acquired since January1, 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenues decreased from 85% for the year ended December31, 2010 to 81% for the year ended December31, 2011 primarily due to the impact of higher overall revenues described above. 
Amortization of intangible assets.Amortization of intangible assets decreased $86 million
to $290 million for the year ended December31, 2011. This decrease was primarily due to reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible assets as certain of these assets became fully amortized, partially offset by increased
amortization of intangibles associated with businesses acquired during 2010 and 2011. Interest
expense.Interest expense decreased $31 million as compared to the year ended December31, 2010, primarily due to the redemption of all of our 375% convertible subordinated notes due 2026 375%Noteson
May14, 2010. Interest income.Interest income decreased $04 million to
$11 million for the year ended December31, 2011, primarily as a result of lower average cash balances during the year ended December31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December31, 2010.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt.Loss on
early extinguishment of debt was $71 million for the year ended December31, 2010. The loss on early extinguishment of debt was a result of the redemption of all of the outstanding 375%Notes on May14, 2010. This loss includes a
non-cash loss of $35 million related to the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the 375%Notes calculated as of the date of redemption, the payment of $23million for the 1607% redemption premium
above par value and a non-cash loss of $13 million from the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 375%Notes. Provision for income taxes.The provision for income taxes was $631 million for the year ended December31, 2011, with an effective tax rate of 326%. The provision for
income taxes was $889 million for the year ended December31, 2010, with an effective tax rate of 380%. The effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were impacted by the recording of tax benefits in the amount of $84 million in 2011 and $76
million in 2010 associated with decreases in reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of various federal and state statutes of limitations and settlement of certain tax audits. The lower tax rate in 2011 relates to a
decrease in valuation allowance on foreign tax credits, favorable tax rate differentials on foreign earnings and lower tax expenses on income from unincorporated joint ventures. Segment Results The following table sets forth segment

Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment Results 
Revenues for this segment increased $118 billion, or 392%, to $421 billion for the year ended December31, 2012.
Revenues were positively impacted by increased revenues from electric power transmission projects and solar power generation projects as a result of increased capital spending by our customers. Revenues in 2012 were also favorably impacted by the
contribution of approximately $2013 million in revenues from acquired companies. Also contributing to the increase was a $772 million increase in revenues from emergency restoration services, primarily resulting from Hurricane Sandy, which
impacted the northeastern United States in the fourth quarter of 2012. Operating income increased $1831
million, or 542%, to $5208 million for the year ended December31, 2012. Operating income as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 124% for the year ended

December31, 2012 from 112% for the year ended December31, 2011. These increases were primarily due to the overall increase in segment revenues described above, which improved this
segments ability to cover fixed and overhead costs, as well as higher margins earned on certain major transmission projects ongoing during 2012. The increase in operating margins was partially offset by the completion of certain higher margin
solar power generation projects in 2011. Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment Results
Revenues for this segment increased $5235 million, or 518%, to $153 billion for the year ended
December31, 2012. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number and size of pipeline transmission projects primarily related to unconventional shale developments in certain regions of North America. Revenues from
distribution services also increased during the year ended December31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December31, 2011, primarily as a result of the incremental contribution of revenues from certain new master service agreements, as
well as increased spending by our customers in certain regions of the United States. Revenues were also favorably impacted by the contribution of approximately $303 million in revenues from acquired companies. 
Operating income increased $1337 million, or 1708%, to $554 million for the year ended December31, 2012 from an
operating loss of $783 million for the year ended December31, 2011. Operating income as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 36% for the year ended December31, 2012 from a negative 77% for the year ended December31,
2011. Operating margins in 2011 were negatively impacted by increased costs resulting from performance issues on certain gas transmission projects completed during the first quarter of 2011 associated with adverse weather conditions and regulatory
restrictions. Operating income for the year ended December31, 2011 was also negatively impacted by a $326 million charge to this segments results in connection with the withdrawal of certain of our subsidiaries from an underfunded
multi-employer pension plan. Operating income as a percentage of revenues in 2012 also increased as a result of the overall increase in segment revenues during 2012, which improved this segments ability to cover operating overhead and
administrative costs. Fiber Optic Licensing and Other Segment Results 
Revenues for this segment increased $192 million, or 120%, to $1790 million for the year ended December31, 2012.
The increase in revenues was primarily due to increased spending on ancillary telecommunications and wireless infrastructure projects by customers operating within the electric power energy industry. 
Operating income increased $78 million, or 146%, to $613 million for the year ended December31, 2012. Operating
income as a percentage of segment revenues for the year ended December31, 2012 remained relatively constant at 342% compared to 335% for the year ended December31, 2011. 
Corporate and Non-allocated Costs Certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments. Corporate and non-allocated costs for the year ended December31, 2012
increased $544 million to $1724 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately $284 million associated with higher personnel and incentive compensation costs associated with current levels of operating activity, an
increase of $87 million in amortization expense, an increase of $76 million in professional fees associated with ongoing technology development costs, business development initiatives and legal matters and a $28 million increase in bad debt
expense.

2011 compared to 2010 
Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment Results 
Revenues for this segment increased $9939 million, or 490%, to $302 billion for the year ended December31, 2011.
Revenues were primarily impacted by increased capital spending by our customers primarily associated with electric power transmission projects. Revenues in 2011 were also favorably impacted by the contribution of $2354 million in revenues from
acquired businesses. Also contributing to the increase was an increase of $769 million in emergency restoration services primarily resulting from Hurricane Irene, which impacted the east coast region of the United States. 
Operating income increased $1336 million, or 655%, to $3377 million for the year ended December31, 2011, and
operating income as a percentage of segment revenues increased to 112% for the year ended December31, 2011 from 101% for the year ended December31, 2010. These increases were primarily due to the overall increase in the volume of
segment revenues described above, which improved this segments ability to cover fixed and overhead costs, as well as higher margins earned on certain solar power generation projects and from emergency restoration services performed in 2011 as
compared to 2010. The increase in operating margins was partially offset by the completion of certain higher margin electric transmission projects during 2010 as compared to electric transmission projects that were in earlier stages of completion
during 2011. Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment Results 
Revenues for this segment decreased $3816 million, or 274%, to $101 billion for the year ended December31, 2011.
Revenues were negatively impacted by a decrease in the number and size of projects as a result of delays in spending by our customers, specifically in connection with natural gas transmission projects. These decreases were partially offset by
increases in revenues from distribution services as a result of the incremental contribution of certain new master service agreements for natural gas distribution services as well as increased spending by our customers in certain areas of the United
States. Operating income decreased $1971 million, or 1659%, to a loss of $783 million for the year ended
December31, 2011. Operating income as a percentage of segment revenues decreased to a negative 77% for the year ended December31, 2011 from 85% for the year ended December31, 2010. These decreases were primarily due to the impact
of increased project costs related to performance issues caused by adverse weather conditions and regulatory restrictions on certain gas transmission projects completed during 2011. Also contributing to these decreases was a $326 million charge to
this segments operating results in 2011 associated with the withdrawal of certain of our subsidiaries from an underfunded multi-employer pension plan, as well as the negative impact of the lower overall revenues described above, which
negatively impacted this segments ability to cover fixed and overhead costs. Fiber Optic Licensing and Other
Segment Results Revenues for this segment decreased $480 million, or 231%, to $1599 million for the
year ended December31, 2011. This decrease in revenues was primarily the result of a decrease in the volume of work associated with a long-haul fiber installation performed during 2010 that was not replaced during 2011. This decrease was
partially offset by an increase in revenues during 2011 as compared to 2010 from telecommunication services that we perform on a limited and ancillary basis, primarily to our customers in the electric power industry. 
Operating income increased nominally to $535 million for the year ended December31, 2011. Operating income as a
percentage of segment revenues for the year ended December31, 2011 increased to 335% from 255% for the year ended December31, 2010, primarily due to a higher percentage of fiber optic licensing revenues earned during 2011 which bear
higher margins than the long-haul fiber installation performed during 2010.

Corporate and Non-allocated Costs 
Certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets are not allocated to segments.
Corporate and non-allocated costs for the year ended December31, 2011 decreased $138 million to $1181 million. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $86 million in amortization expense as previously acquired intangible assets
have become fully amortized and a decrease of $79 million in acquisition and integration costs. Partially offsetting these decreases was a $29 million increase in costs associated with various business development initiatives. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements Our cash and cash equivalents
totaled $3947 million as of December31, 2012. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, cash and cash equivalents held in domestic bank accounts were approximately $2541 million and $2309 million, and cash and cash equivalents held in foreign
bank accounts were approximately $1406 million and $844 million. We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our credit facility, and our future cash flows from operations will provide sufficient
funds to enable us to meet our future operating needs and our planned capital expenditures, as well as facilitate our ability to grow in the foreseeable future. 
Our industry is capital intensive, and we expect the need for substantial capital expenditures to continue into the
foreseeable future to meet the anticipated demand for our services. Capital expenditures are expected to total $200 million to $210 million for 2013. Approximately $35 million to $45 million of the expected 2013 capital expenditures are targeted for
the expansion of our fiber optic networks. We also evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from
time to time that may require cash, as well as opportunities to make investments in customer-sponsored projects where we anticipate performing services such as project management, engineering, procurement or construction services. These investment
opportunities exist in the markets and industries we serve and may require the use of cash in the form of debt or equity investments. Management continues to monitor the financial markets and general national and global economic conditions. We consider our cash investment policies to be conservative in that we maintain a diverse
portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality cash investments with short-term maturities. We were in compliance with our covenants under our credit facility at December31, 2012. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that any weakness in the
capital markets will have a material impact on the principal amounts of our cash investments or our ability to rely upon our existing credit facility for funds. To date, we have experienced no loss of or lack of access to our cash or cash
equivalents or funds available under our credit facility; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents or availability under our credit facility will not be impacted in the future by adverse conditions
in the financial markets. Sources and Uses of Cash 
As of December31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3947 million and working capital of $132 billion. We
also had $1832 million of letters of credit and no revolving loans outstanding under our credit facility, with $5168 million available for borrowing or issuing new letters of credit under our credit facility. 
Operating Activities Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services, operating margins and the type of services we provide, but can also be influenced by working capital needs, in particular on
larger projects, due to the timing of collection of receivables and the settlement of payables and other obligations. Working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and fall months due to increased demand for our services
47 Table of Contents

when favorable weather conditions exist in many of the regions in which we operate. Conversely, working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the winter months; however, these
seasonal trends can be impacted by changes in the timing of major projects and other economic factors that may affect customer spending. Operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash to us of $1668 million during 2012 as compared to $2041 million during 2011 and $2176 million during 2010. The decrease in operating
cash flows from continuing operations for 2012 as compared to 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to increased working capital requirements in 2012 as a result of an increase in the number and size of projects that were ongoing during the current
period, primarily related to electric power and the natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services segments, partially offset by improved operating results. Investing Activities During 2012, we used net cash in
investing activities from continuing operations of $3211 million as compared to $2723 million and $2499 million used in investing activities in 2011 and 2010. Investing activities from continuing operations in 2012 included $2094 million used
for capital expenditures, partially offset by $124 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. Additionally, investing activities from continuing operations in 2012 included $687 million used in connection with business acquisitions and $538
million used in equity investment contributions, primarily to HEP. Investing activities from continuing operations in 2011 included $1623 million used for capital expenditures, $797 million used in connection with business acquisitions and the
$350 million capital contribution to acquire an initial equity interest in HEP, partially offset by $91 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. Investing activities from continuing operations in 2010 included $1303 million of net cash
used in connection with our acquisition of Valard and $1440 million used for capital expenditures, partially offset by $244 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment. Our industry is capital intensive, and we expect the need for substantial
capital expenditures to continue into the foreseeable future to meet the anticipated demand for our services. In addition, we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, although we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of
the potential cash outlays for these initiatives. Financing Activities 
In 2012, net cash used by financing activities from continuing operations was $153 million as compared to cash used by
financing activities of $1587 million and $1457 million in 2011 and 2010. Financing activities from continuing operations during 2012 included $180 million of cash payments to noncontrolling interests as distributions of joint venture profits.
Financing activities from continuing operations in 2011 primarily related to $1495 million in common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, $60 million of cash payments to noncontrolling interests as distribution of joint venture
profits as well as $41 million of loan costs related to the amendment and restatement of our credit facility on August2, 2011. Financing activities in 2010 primarily related to $1438 million in payments for the redemption of the aggregate
principal amount of our 375%Notes, described below in Debt Instruments. Debt Instruments
Credit Facility We have a credit agreement that provides for a $7000 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on August2, 2016. The entire amount of the facility is available for the issuance of
letters of credit. Up to $1000 million of the facility is available for borrowings and letters of credit in certain alternative currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar. Borrowings under the credit agreement are to be used to refinance existing
indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. 
48 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
As of December31, 2012, we had approximately $1832 million of letters
of credit issued and no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. The remaining $5168 million was available for borrowings or issuing new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in U.S. dollars bear interest, at our
option, at a rate equal to either athe Eurocurrency Rate as defined in the credit agreement plus 125% to 250%, as determined based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio as described below, plus, if applicable, any Mandatory Cost as
defined in the credit agreement required to compensate lenders for the cost of compliance with certain European regulatory requirements, or bthe Base Rate as described below plus 025% to 150%, as determined based on our Consolidated
Leverage Ratio. Amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 125% to 250%, as determined based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, plus, if
applicable, any Mandatory Cost. Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of 125% to 250%, based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, and Performance Letters of Credit as defined in the
credit agreement issued under the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations are subject to a letter of credit fee of 075% to 150%, based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio. We are also subject to a commitment fee of 020% to
045%, based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused availability under the credit agreement. The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is the ratio of our total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement. For purposes
of calculating both the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the maximum senior debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio discussed below, total funded debt and total senior debt are reduced by all cash and Cash Equivalents as defined in the credit agreement
held by us in excess of $250 million. The Base Rate equals the highest of ithe Federal Funds Rate as defined in the credit agreement plus 1/2 of 1%, iiBank of Americas prime rate and iiithe Eurocurrency Rate plus
100%. Subject to certain exceptions, the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets and
the assets of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of our direct foreign subsidiaries and the direct foreign subsidiaries of our wholly
owned U.S. subsidiaries. Our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit agreement. Subject to certain conditions, at any time we maintain a corporate credit rating that is BBB- stable or higher
by Standard Poors Rating Services and a corporate family rating that is Baa3 stable or higher by Moodys Investors Services, all collateral will be automatically released from these liens. 
The credit agreement contains certain covenants, including a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and a minimum interest
coverage ratio, in each case as specified in the credit agreement. The credit agreement also contains a maximum senior debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio, as specified in the credit agreement, that will be in effect at any time that the collateral
securing the credit agreement has been and remains released. The credit agreement limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, capital expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain
exceptions, prohibits liens on assets. The credit agreement also includes limits on the payment of dividends and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock. As of
December31, 2012, we were in compliance with all of the covenants in the credit agreement. The credit
agreement provides for customary events of default and includes cross-default provisions with our underwriting, continuing indemnity and security agreement with our sureties and all of our other debt instruments exceeding $300 million in borrowings
or availability. If an event of default as defined in the credit agreement occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, amounts outstanding under the credit agreement may be accelerated
and may become or be declared immediately due and payable. Prior to August2, 2011, we had a credit
agreement that provided for a $4750 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing September19, 2012. Subject to the conditions specified in the prior credit agreement, borrowings under the prior credit facility were to be used for
working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The entire unused portion of the prior credit facility was available for the issuance of letters of credit. 
49 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Amounts borrowed under the prior credit facility bore interest, at our
option, at a rate equal to either athe Eurodollar Rate as defined in the prior credit agreement plus 0875% to 175%, as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the prior credit agreement, or
bthe base rate as described below plus 000% to 075%, as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the prior credit facility were subject to a letter of credit fee of 0875% to
175%, based on the ratio of our total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. We were also subject to a commitment fee of 015% to 035%, based on the ratio of our total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the prior
credit facility. The base rate equaled the higher of ithe Federal Funds Rate as defined in the prior credit agreement plus 1/2 of 1% or iithe banks prime rate. 
375% Convertible Subordinated Notes As of December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, none of our 375% Notes were outstanding. The 375% Notes were originally issued in April 2006 for an aggregate principal amount of $1438 million
and required semi-annual interest payments on April30 and October30 until maturity. On May14, 2010, we redeemed all of the $1438 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 375% Notes at a redemption price of 101607%
of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. The redemption resulted in the payment of the aggregate redemption price of $1461 million and the recognition of a loss on
extinguishment of debt of approximately $71 million. Included in the loss on early extinguishment of debt was a non-cash loss of $35 million related to the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the 375% Notes
calculated as of the date of redemption, the payment of $23 million representing the 1607% redemption premium above par value and a non-cash loss of $13 million from the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to
the 375% Notes. Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
As is common in our industry, we have entered into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of
business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets. Our significant off-balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with non-cancelable operating leases, letter of credit obligations, commitments to expand our
fiber optic networks, commitments to purchase equipment, surety guarantees, multi-employer pension plan liabilities and obligations relating to our joint venture arrangements. Certain joint venture structures involve risks not directly reflected in
our balance sheets. For certain joint ventures, we have guaranteed all of the obligations of the joint venture under a contract with the customer. Additionally, other joint venture arrangements qualify as a general partnership, for which we are
jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture. In our joint venture arrangements, each joint venturer indemnifies the other party for any liabilities incurred in excess of the liabilities such other party is obligated
to bear under the respective joint venture agreement. Other than as previously discussed, we have not engaged in any material off-balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities, and we have no material guarantees of the work
or obligations of third parties. Leases 
We enter into non-cancelable operating leases for many of our facility, vehicle and equipment needs. These leases allow us
to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities, vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them. We may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term, in which case we are typically liable to the
lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease. We have guaranteed the residual value of
the underlying assets under certain of our equipment operating leases at the date of termination of such leases. We have agreed to pay any difference between this residual value and the fair market value of each underlying asset as of the lease
termination date. As of December31, 2012, the maximum guaranteed residual value was approximately $2081 million. We believe that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased
equipment and the guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance that future significant payments will not be required.

Letters of Credit 
Certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf,
such as to beneficiaries under our self-funded insurance programs. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require us to post letters of credit to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts and to guarantee
performance under our contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution, typically pursuant to our credit facility. Each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of
the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, we
may also be required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. We do not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future. 
As of December31, 2012, we had $1832 million in letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility primarily
to secure obligations under our casualty insurance program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2013. Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters of
credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods. Performance Bonds and Parent Guarantees 
Many customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require us to post performance and payment bonds issued
by a financial institution known as a surety. These bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform under a contract or to pay
subcontractors and vendors, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond. We must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. Under our underwriting, continuing indemnity and security
agreement with our sureties and with the consent of our lenders under our credit facility, we have granted security interests in certain of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the sureties. Subject to certain conditions and consistent
with terms of our credit facility, these security interests will be automatically released if we maintain a corporate credit rating that is BBB- stable or higher by Standard Poors Rating Services and a corporate family rating that
is Baa3 stable or higher by Moodys Investors Services. We may be required to post letters of credit or other collateral in favor of the sureties or our customers in the future. Posting letters of credit in favor of the sureties or our
customers would reduce the borrowing availability under our credit facility. To date, we have not been required to make any reimbursements to our sureties for bond-related costs. We believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund significant
claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future. As of December31, 2012, the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was approximately $20 billion, and the estimated cost to complete these bonded projects was
approximately $6434 million. From time to time, we guarantee the obligations of our wholly owned
subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease obligations, certain joint venture arrangements and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. We are not aware of
any material obligations for performance or payment asserted against us under any of these guarantees. Contractual
Obligations As of December31, 2012, our future contractual obligations were as follows in
thousands:  Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Operating lease obligations 94,165 24,264 19,689 15,324 11,929 6,767 16,192 Equipment purchase commitments 13,546 13,546 Committed capital expenditures for fiber optic networks under contracts with customers 17,418 17,418

The committed capital expenditures for fiber optic networks represent
commitments related to signed contracts with customers. The amounts are estimates of costs required to build the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures related to building the networks could vary materially from these estimates.
Also during 2012, we committed capital for the expansion of our vehicle fleet in order to accommodate manufacturer lead times on certain types of vehicles. As of December31, 2012, production orders for approximately $135 million had been
issued with delivery dates expected to occur throughout 2013. Although we have committed to the purchase of these vehicles at the time of their delivery, we intend that these orders will be assigned to third party leasing companies and made
available to us under certain of our master equipment lease agreements, which will release us from our capital commitment. As of December31, 2012, the total unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions was $512 million. Although the Internal Revenue Service completed its examination related to calendar
year 2009 during 2012, certain of our subsidiaries remain under examination by various state and Canadian tax authorities for multiple periods, and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could therefore increase or decrease as a result of the
expiration of certain statutes of limitations or settlements of these audits. We believe it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease up to $115 million due to the expiration of certain statutes of
limitations or settlements of the audits. The previously presented table of estimated contractual obligations
does not reflect obligations under the multi-employer pension plans in which our union employees participate. Several of our operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements that require us to provide to the employees subject
to these agreements specified wages and benefits, as well as to make contributions to multi-employer pension plans. Our multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements usually on an
annual basis, and contributions are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis based on our union employee payrolls. Our obligations for contributions to multi-employer pension plans cannot be determined for future periods because the
location and number of union employees that we have employed at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects we have ongoing at any time and the need for union resources in connection with those projects.
We may also have additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of our participation in multi-employer
defined benefit pension plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multi-employer plan if the
employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. These liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not merely the benefits payable to a
contributing employers own retirees. Other than as noted below, we are not aware of any material amounts of withdrawal liability that have been or are expected to be incurred as a result of a withdrawal by any of our operating units from any
multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. We may also be required to make additional contributions to our
multi-employer pension plans if they become underfunded, and these additional contributions will be determined based on our union employee payrolls. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and operational rules generally applicable
to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded
status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions and/or modifications to retiree benefits. A
number of multi-employer plans to which our operating units contribute or may contribute in the future are in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that we
may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be reasonably estimated and is not included in the above table due to uncertainty of the future levels of work that require the specific use of the union employees covered by these
plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.

We recorded a partial withdrawal liability of approximately $326 million in
the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the withdrawal by certain of our subsidiaries from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan the Central States Plan. The partial withdrawal liability we recognized is based on estimates
received from the Central States Plan during 2011 for a complete withdrawal by all of our subsidiaries participating in the Central States Plan. During the third quarter of 2012, the Central States Plan provided an estimate of the potential
withdrawal liability, indicating that the withdrawal liability is approximately $328 million based on a partial withdrawal in the fourth quarter of 2011, approximately $397 million based on a partial withdrawal in the first quarter of 2012, or
approximately $401 million based upon a complete withdrawal in 2012. However, we continue to dispute the assertions of the Central States Plan regarding the effective date of the withdrawal. 
We expect to receive a formal assessment of the partial withdrawal liability from the Central States Plan and may seek to
challenge and further negotiate the assessment at that time. As a result, the final partial withdrawal liability cannot yet be determined with certainty and could be materially higher or lower than the charges we have recognized. Following the
formal assessment, we will be required to pay the assessed amount over a period of years, although the number of years is not certain and we may also negotiate a lump-sum payment. As a result of these various factors, the estimated partial
withdrawal liability of $326 million has not been included in the table above. For additional information regarding the partial withdrawal liability, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data. Also excluded from the above table is interest associated with
letters of credit fees and commitment fees under our credit facility because the outstanding letters of credit, availability and applicable interest rates and fees are variable. For additional information regarding the interest rates under our
credit facility, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Self-Insurance We are insured for employers
liability, general liability, auto liability and workers compensation claims. Since August1, 2009, policy deductible levels are $50 million per occurrence, other than employers liability, which is subject to a deductible of $10
million. We also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year. 
Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims
reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of
damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. As of
December31, 2012 and 2011, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $1608 million and $2012 million, with $1202 million and $1554 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related
insurance recoveries/receivables as of December31, 2012 and 2011 were $222 million and $631 million, of which $23 million and $98 million are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $199 million and $533 million are
included in other assets, net. These balance sheet amounts include liabilities and recoveries/receivables related to the insurance claims retained by us associated with the sale of our telecommunication operating units on December3, 2012.
We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance
coverage may change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or we may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of insurance if we believe that the cost to
obtain such coverage exceeds the additional benefits obtained. In any such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Concentration of Credit Risk 
We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our accounts
receivable, including amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of our cash investments are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality
financial institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand
deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less. Although we do not currently believe the principal amount of these investments is subject to any material risk of loss,
changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income we receive from these investments. In addition, we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to our customers, which include electric power, natural gas and
oil pipeline companies, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United States and Canada. Consequently, we are subject to potential credit risk
related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States and Canada, which may be heightened as a result of uncertain economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. However, we generally have
certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Historically, some of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties in the future. These difficulties expose us to
increased risk related to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for services we have performed. For each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, one
customer accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated revenues. The services provided to these customers relate primarily to our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment in 2011 and our Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services
segment in 2010. As of December31, 2012, two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of consolidated billed and accrued accounts receivable. Substantially all of the balance for the customer with 11% of consolidated billed and
accrued accounts receivable relates to one contract and is comprised primarily of certain contract change orders for which the customer acceptance process is ongoing. Additionally, as of December 31, 2011, one customer accounted for approximately
10% of consolidated billed and accrued accounts receivable. The services provided to these customers, with billed and accrued receivable balances greater than 10% of the consolidated balance, relate primarily to our Electric Power Infrastructure
Services segment. No other customers represented 10% or more of revenues for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 or of billed and unbilled accounts receivable as of December31, 2012 and 2011. 
Litigation and Claims We are from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for
alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, we
record a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we disclose matters for which management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. See
Note15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding litigation and claims. 
Related Party Transactions In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions from time to time with related parties. These transactions typically take the form of facility leases with prior owners of certain acquired
companies. Inflation Due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, inflation did not have a significant effect on our results.

New Accounting Pronouncements 
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements.
On January1, 2012, we adopted an update issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB that amends
certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements. Additional disclosure requirements in the update include: 1for Level3 fair value measurements, quantitative information about unobservable inputs used,
a description of the valuation processes used by the entity, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs; 2for an entitys use of a nonfinancial asset that is different
from the assets highest and best use, the reason for the difference; 3for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required, the fair value hierarchy level in which the fair value
measurements were determined; and 4the disclosure of all transfers between Level1 and Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. The adoption of the update did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. Also on January1, 2012, we adopted an update issued by the FASB that eliminates the
option to present the components of other comprehensive income only as part of the statement of equity. This guidance is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements by requiring that such amounts be
presented either in a single continuous statement of income and comprehensive income or separately in consecutive statements of income and comprehensive income. We now present consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a result of adopting
the update. On January1, 2012, we also adopted an update issued by the FASB that gives entities the
option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of
a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. An entity can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. An
entity can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. The updatealso
includes new qualitative indicators that replace those previously used to determine whether an annual or interim goodwill impairment test is required to be performed. The adoption of the updatedid not have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted. 
In July 2012, the FASB issued an update that gives entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that its indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If, based on its qualitative assessment, an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that
the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. The update is
effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies 
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are published and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods
presented. We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any 
55 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are
made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Management has reviewed its development
and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements: Revenue Recognition 
Infrastructure Services Through our Electric Power Infrastructure Services and Natural Gas and Pipeline
Infrastructure Services segments, we design, install and maintain networks for customers in the electric power and natural gas and oil pipeline industries. These services may be provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance
contracts and fixed price and non-fixed price installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly or time and materials basis or fixed price or lump sum basis, and the final terms and prices of
these contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer. Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these contracts, we recognize revenue as units are completed based
on pricing established between us and the customer for each unit of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under our cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, we recognize
revenue on an input basis, as labor hours are incurred and services are performed. Revenues from fixed price
contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such
contracts provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered, which may be measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or some other measure of progress. Contract costs include all direct
materials, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the material associated with our work is owner-furnished and is
therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and
final contract settlements are factors that influence managements assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore, our profit recognition. Changes in these factors may result in
revisions to costs and income, and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable and the
amount can be reasonably estimated. If actual results significantly differ from our estimates used for revenue recognition and claim assessments, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. 
We may incur costs subject to change orders, whether approved or unapproved by the customer, and/or claims related to
certain contracts. We determine the probability that such costs will be recovered based upon evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or verbal approvals. We treat items as
a cost of contract performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated. As of December31,
2012 and 2011, we had approximately $2050 million and $773 million of change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts which were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of
business. The current asset Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted
contracts represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price contracts. The current liability Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of
revenues recognized for fixed price contracts.

Fiber Optic Licensing The fiber optic licensing business
constructs and licenses the right to use fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under those agreements,
customers are provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the facility owned and maintained by us. Revenues, including any initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over the expected length of
the agreements, including probable renewal periods. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, initial fees and advance billings on these licensing agreements not yet recorded in revenue were $464 million and $474 million and are recognized as
deferred revenue, with $377 million and $383 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Actual revenues may differ from those estimates if the contracts are not renewed as expected. 
Self-Insurance.We are insured for employers liability, general liability, auto
liability and workers compensation claims. Since August1, 2009, policy deductible levels are $50 million per occurrence, other than employers liability, which is subject to a deductible of $10 million. We also have employee
healthcare benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year. 
Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimate of the ultimate liability for claims
reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of
damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. As of
December31, 2012 and 2011, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $1608 million and $2012 million, with $1202 million and $1554 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related
insurance recoveries/receivables as of December31, 2012 and 2011 were $222 million and $631 million, of which $23 million and $98 million are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $199 million and $533 million are
included in other assets, net. These balance sheet amounts include liabilities and recoveries/receivables related to the insurance claims retained by us associated with the sale of our telecommunication operating units on December3, 2012.
We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance
coverage may change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel our coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or we may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of insurance if we believe that the cost to
obtain such coverage exceeds the additional benefits obtained. In any such event, our overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
Valuation of Goodwill.We have recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisitions.
Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for impairment, which we perform at the operating unit level. Each of our operating units is organized into one of three internal divisions, which are closely aligned with our reportable segments, based on
the predominant type of work performed by the operating unit at the point in time the divisional designation is made. Because separate measures of assets and cash flows are not produced or utilized by management to evaluate segment performance, our
impairment assessments of our goodwill do not include any consideration of assets and cash flows by reportable segment. As a result, we have determined that our individual operating units represent our reporting units for the purpose of assessing
goodwill impairments. As further discussed in New Accounting Pronouncements, we adopted an update
issued by the FASB, which gives entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step fair value-based impairment test described below. If an entity believes that, as a result of its
qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. An entity can choose to
57 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. An entity can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to
step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. This update also includes new qualitative indicators that replaced those previously used to determine whether an annual or interim
goodwill impairment test is required to be performed. For instance, deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, declining financial performance, or a sustained decrease in share price, among other things, may trigger the need for annual or interim
impairment testing of goodwill associated with one or all of the reporting units. Our goodwill impairment
assessment is performed at year-end, or more frequently if events or circumstances arise which indicate that goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a decrease in our market capitalization below book value, a significant change in business climate
or loss of a significant customer, as well as the qualitative indicators referenced above, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of goodwill for one or all of our reporting units. The first step of the two-step fair value-based test
involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares the carrying
amount of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of its goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill with a corresponding
charge to operating expense. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighted combination
of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in managements opinion, this method currently results in the most accurate calculation
of a reporting units fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount
rates, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. We believe that the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of
the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. Under the discounted cash flow method, we determine fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry discount rates,
which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Cash flow projections are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts typically a two-year model plus
an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur, along with a terminal
value derived from the reporting units earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA. The EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit are based on trailing twelve-month comparable industry data. 
Under the market multiple and market capitalization approaches, we determine the estimated fair value of each of our
reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting units projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using either a one, two or three year average. For the market capitalization
approach, we add a reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit in an orderly transaction between market participants.

The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by reporting unit
were used to determine fair value under the three approaches discussed herein. The following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of our reporting units at December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010:

For recently acquired reporting units, a step one impairment test may indicate an implied
fair value that is substantially similar to the reporting units carrying value. Such similarities in value are generally an indication that managements estimates of future cash flows associated with the recently acquired reporting unit
remain relatively consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its initial fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2012, a goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of our reporting units, which indicated that the implied fair
value of each of our reporting units, other than recently acquired reporting units, was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Following the analysis, management concluded that no impairment was indicated at any reporting unit. As discussed
generally above, when evaluating the 2012 step one impairment test results, management considered many factors in determining whether or not an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit was reasonably likely to occur in future periods, including
future market conditions and the economic environment in which our reporting units were operating. Additionally, management considered the sensitivity of its fair value estimates to changes in certain valuation assumptions and, after giving
consideration to at least a 10% decrease in the fair value of each of Quantas reporting units, the results of the assessment at December31, 2012 did not change. 
The goodwill analysis performed for each operating unit was based on estimates and industry comparables obtained from the
electric power, natural gas and oil pipeline and fiber optic licensing industries, and no impairment was indicated. The 15-year discounted cash flow model used for fiber optic licensing was based on the long-term nature of the underlying fiber
network licensing agreements. We assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow approach in all
periods to reflect increased expectations of market value being determined from a held and used model. Discount rates for the 2012 and 2011 analyses declined from those of the year prior for the operating units providing predominately
electric power and natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services due to generally more favorable market conditions for these operating units in 2012 as compared to 2011 and in 2011 as compared to 2010. Additionally, discount rates for the 2012
analysis declined from those of the prior years for the operating unit providing predominately fiber optic licensing due to generally more favorable market conditions for this operating unit in 2012 as compared to 2011 and 2010. 
As stated previously, cash flows are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts that have been evaluated by
management. In connection with the 2012 assessment, projected annual growth rates by reporting unit varied widely with ranges from 0% to 13% for operating units in the electric power and the natural gas and pipeline divisions and 0% to 21% for the
operating unit in fiber optic licensing. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our
projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Changes in our judgments and projections could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of reporting units and intangible assets and could result in an impairment.
Variances in the 
59 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, cost of capital, growth rates and acquisition multiples applied could have an impact on the assessment of impairments and any amount of
goodwill impairment charges recorded. For example, lower growth rates, lower acquisition multiples or higher costs of capital assumptions would all individually lead to lower fair value assessments and potentially increased frequency or size of
goodwill impairments. Any goodwill or other intangible impairment would be included in the consolidated statements of operations. Based on the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis, we compared the sum of fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization at December31, 2012 and determined that the excess
of the aggregate fair value of all reporting units to our market capitalization reflected a reasonable control premium. Our market capitalization at December31, 2012 was approximately $571 billion, and our total equity was approximately $377
billion. We determined that there was no goodwill impairment at December31, 2012. Increases in the carrying value of individual reporting units that may be indicated by our impairment tests are not recorded, therefore we may record goodwill
impairments in the future, even when the aggregate fair value of our reporting units as a whole may increase. 
We and our customers continue to operate in an uncertain business environment, with increasing regulatory requirements
and only gradual recovery in the economy from recessionary levels. We are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market conditions have had or may have on them. Certain of our customers have reduced spending in
recent years, which we attribute to the negative economic and market conditions, and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for some of our services in the near-term. We continue to evaluate the impact of the
economic environment on our reporting units and the valuation of recorded goodwill. Although we are not aware of circumstances that would lead to a goodwill impairment at a reporting unit currently, circumstances such as a continued market decline,
the loss of a major customer or other factors could impact the valuation of goodwill in the future. Our
goodwill is included in multiple reporting units. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, and the other factors described under Risk Factors in Item1A, the profitability of our individual reporting units may suffer from
downturns in customer demand and other factors. These factors may have a disproportionate impact on the individual reporting units as compared to Quanta as a whole and might adversely affect such fair value of individual reporting units. If material
adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting units, our future estimates of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units, and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered
recoverable. Valuation of Other Intangibles.Our intangible assets include
customer relationships, backlog, trade names, non-compete agreements, patented rights and developed technology, all subject to amortization, along with other intangible assets not subject to amortization. The value of customer relationships is
estimated as of the date a business is acquired based on the value-in-use concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows
attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration given to customer contract renewals, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to our business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. We value backlog
for acquired businesses as of the acquisition date based upon the contractual nature of the backlog within each service line, using the income approach to discount back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog. The value of trade
names is estimated as of the date a business is acquired using the relief-from-royalty method of the income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit
the related benefits of this intangible asset. We amortize intangible assets based upon the estimated
consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset or on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment
and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
60 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of intangible
assets. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets.We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. This requires us to make
long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and
our projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference
between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value. Such expense would be reflected in income loss from operations in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, we estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and other
intangibles and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate. 
Current and Long-term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.We provide an
allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or note receivable is considered doubtful, and receivables are written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful
accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others, our customers access to capital, our customers willingness or ability to pay, general economic and market conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. We
consider accounts receivable delinquent after 30 days but do not generally include delinquent accounts in our analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts unless the accounts receivable have been outstanding for at least 90 days. In addition to
balances that have been outstanding for 90 days or more, we also include accounts receivable in our analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts if they relate to customers in bankruptcy or with other known difficulties. Material changes in our
customers business or cash flows, which may be impacted by negative economic and market conditions, could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them. Should customers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should
anticipated recoveries relating to the receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided. 
Income Taxes.We follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect
when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. We regularly evaluate valuation
allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. The estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual future taxable income
differs from our estimates, we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated. We record
reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain tax positions assuming that the taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such,
we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in our future consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations.

Outlook We currently see growth opportunities across all the industries we serve. However, we and our customers continue to operate in a difficult business environment, with gradual improvement in the economy and
continuing uncertainty in the marketplace. Our customers are also facing stringent regulatory and environmental requirements as they implement projects to enhance and expand their infrastructure. These economic and regulatory factors have negatively
affected our results in the past and may continue to create some uncertainty as to the timing of spending. We believe that our financial and operational strengths will enable us to manage these challenges and uncertainties, and we remain optimistic
about our long-term opportunities. Electric Power Infrastructure Services Segment 
The North American electric grid is aging and requires significant upgrades and maintenance to meet current and future
demands for power. Over the past several years, many utilities across North America have begun to implement plans to improve their transmission systems, improve reliability and reduce congestion, and new construction, structure change-outs, line
upgrades and maintenance projects on many transmission systems are occurring or planned to occur. In addition, state renewable portfolio standards, which set required or voluntary standards for how much power is to be generated from renewable energy
sources, can result in the need for additional transmission lines and substations to transport the power from the facilities, which are often in remote locations, to demand centers. Other factors, such as the reliability standards issued by the
North American Electric Reliability Corporation NERC and other regulatory actions, are also driving transmission system upgrades and expansions. We believe these factors create strong opportunities for our transmission infrastructure services.
In the past, the regulatory environment has affected the timing and scope of certain transmission projects,
although these delayed projects typically move to construction. We believe that utilities remain committed to the expansion and strengthening of their transmission infrastructure, with planning, engineering and funding for many of their projects in
place. Throughout 2011 and 2012, a number of large-scale transmission projects were awarded, and we continue to expect additional awards, indicating that transmission spending will continue to be active. Regulatory and environmental processes and
permitting remain a hurdle for some proposed transmission and renewable energy projects, continuing to create uncertainty as to timing of this spending. The timing and scope of projects can also be affected by other factors such as siting,
right-of-way and unfavorable economic and market conditions. The economic feasibility of renewable energy projects, and therefore, the attractiveness of investment in the projects, may also depend on the availability of tax incentive programs or the
ability of the projects to take advantage of such incentives, and there is no assurance that the government will extend existing tax incentives or create new incentive or funding programs in the future. We anticipate many of these issues to be
overcome and spending on transmission projects to be active over the next few years, resulting in a continued shift over the near- and long-term in our electric power services mix to a greater proportion of high-voltage electric power transmission
and substation projects. We currently have a number of these projects underway, and we expect this segments backlog to remain strong throughout 2013 and into 2014. We also anticipate continuing development of renewable energy projects in the
near-term, primarily utility-scale solar facilities, creating increased opportunities for our engineering, procurement and construction services for these projects as developers move forward to complete projects in order to receive investment tax
credits from the federal government. We benefited from increases in distribution spending throughout 2011 and
2012 despite continued economic and election-year political uncertainties. However, as a result of reduced spending by utilities on their distribution systems during 2009 and 2010, combined with the need to meet reliability requirements, we believe
there is an ongoing need for utilities to resume sustained investment in their distribution systems in order to properly maintain their systems. We also anticipate that utilities will continue to integrate smart grid technologies into
their transmission and distribution systems over time to improve grid management and create efficiencies. Development and installation of smart grid technologies and other energy efficiency initiatives have
62 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
benefited from stimulus funding under the ARRA, as well as the implementation of grid management initiatives by utilities and the desire by consumers for more efficient energy use. 
Several existing, pending or proposed legislative or regulatory actions may also positively affect demand for the
services provided by this segment in the long term, particularly in connection with electric power infrastructure and renewable energy spending. For example, legislative or regulatory action that alleviates some of the siting and right-of-way
challenges that impact transmission projects would potentially accelerate future transmission line construction. The FERC recently issued FERC Order No1000 to promote more efficient and cost-effective development of new transmission
facilities. The order establishes transmission planning and cost allocation requirements intended to facilitate multi-state electric transmission lines and to encourage competition by removing, under certain conditions, federal rights of first
refusal from FERC-approved tariffs and agreements. We believe FERC Order No1000, which was affirmed by FERC in May 2012 with the issuance of FERC Order No1000-A, will have a favorable impact on electric transmission line development,
although the impact of its implementation is not expected to occur for several years. We also anticipate increased infrastructure spending by our customers as a result of legislation requiring the power industry to meet federal reliability standards
for its transmission and distribution systems and providing incentives to the industry to invest in and improve maintenance on its systems. Developments in environmental regulations concerning fossil fuel power generation plants are expected to
result in the need to retire or upgrade older coal-fired generation facilities to comply with new environmental and emission rules. Much of the electricity previously generated from retired coal-fired generation facilities is expected to be replaced
over the coming years by newly developed natural gas-fired generation facilities. We believe this coal to gas dynamic may require old transmission lines to be updated, rebuilt or replaced with higher voltage transmission infrastructure
as well as the construction of new transmission infrastructure to connect new natural gas-fired generation facilities to the grid. Several industry and market trends are also prompting customers in the electric power industry to seek outsourcing partners. These trends include an aging utility workforce, increasing costs and labor
issues. We believe the economic recession in the United States slowed employee retirements by many utility workers, causing the growth trend in outsourcing to temporarily pause. As the economy and financial markets continue to recover, we believe
utility employee retirements could return to normal levels, which should result in an increase in outsourcing opportunities. The need to ensure available labor resources for larger projects also drives strategic relationships with customers.
Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services Segment 
We see growth opportunities in our natural gas and oil pipeline operations, primarily in the installation and maintenance
of mainline pipe, gathering systems and related facilities, as well as pipeline integrity and specialty services such as horizontal directional drilling. We believe opportunities for this segment exist as a result of the increase in the ongoing
development of unconventional shale formations that produce natural gas, natural gas liquids and/or crude oil, as well as the development of Canadian oil sands, which will require the construction of mainline pipe infrastructure to connect
production with demand centers and the development of midstream gathering infrastructure within areas of production. We also believe the goals of clean energy and energy independence for North America, as well as more stringent environmental
regulations, will make abundant, low-cost natural gas the fuel of choice to replace coal for power generation over time, creating the need for continued investment in natural gas infrastructure. We believe our position as a leading provider of
mainline pipe and gathering system infrastructure services in North America will allow us to capitalize on these opportunities. The natural gas and oil pipeline industry is cyclical and subject to volatility as a result of fluctuations in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil prices. In the past, sustained periods of low prices
for these products have negatively impacted the development of these natural resources and related infrastructure. In addition, environmental scrutiny, stringent regulatory requirements and cumbersome permitting processes have caused delays in some
mainline pipe projects during the past several years. These dynamics resulted in below average mainline pipe construction opportunities for us and the industry in 2011 and 2012. 
63 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
The lack of mainline pipe opportunities in 2011 and 2012 negatively impacted
our natural gas and pipeline segment margins, in part as a result of our inability to cover certain fixed costs. Margins for our mainline pipe projects are also subject to significant performance risk, which can arise from adverse weather
conditions, challenging geography, customer decisions and crew productivity. Our specific opportunities in the mainline pipe business are sometimes difficult to predict because of the seasonality of the bidding and construction cycles within the
industry. A number of large mainline pipe projects are proposed from the Canadian oil sands and U.S. shale
developments to refineries and other demand centers. These projects are still developing and have not yet materialized into contract awards to the pipeline construction industry. While there is risk that these projects will not occur, we are
encouraged by these proposed mainline pipe development plans, which could create an improved and favorable mainline pipe market in late 2013 and 2014 for us and the industry. We believe we will gain more visibility into this evolving dynamic during
2013. To address some of the cyclicality of the mainline pipe business, we have diversified our service
offerings for the segment by focusing on midstream gathering infrastructure opportunities. We have increased our presence in areas where unconventional shale formations are located, including through the establishment of offices in several areas, to
better position us to successfully pursue projects associated with midstream gathering infrastructure development. The relatively consistent nature of this work could offset some of the cyclical nature of the mainline pipe business while also
providing us growth opportunities. We see steady activity and more opportunities in the liquid-rich unconventional shales and are strategically focusing our efforts to provide services for midstream gathering systems in these shales. 
We also see growth potential in some of our other pipeline services. The U.S. Department of Transportation has
implemented significant regulatory legislation through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration relating to pipeline integrity requirements that we expect will increase the demand for our pipeline integrity, rehabilitation and
replacement services over the long-term. As pipeline integrity testing requirements increase in stringency and frequency, we believe more information will be gathered about the condition of the nations pipeline infrastructure and will result
in an increase in spending by our customers on pipeline integrity initiatives. In early 2012, we acquired an engineering, research and development business that develops and owns pipeline inspection tools, enhancing our pipeline integrity
capabilities. We believe that our ability to offer a complete pipeline integrity turnkey solution to pipeline companies and gas utilities provides us an advantageous position in providing these services to our customers. 
Over the past several years, our natural gas and pipeline infrastructure operations have been challenged, in part by
lower margins in connection with our natural gas distribution services, which were more significantly affected by the economic downturn than other operations in this segment. To improve our ability to be competitive and to generate improved margins
from natural gas distribution projects, we restructured our natural gas distribution operations in 2011 to better align our cost structure to the competitive environment, which has resulted in improved margins in these operations. We believe margins
on natural gas distribution projects will continue to improve over time. Overall, we are optimistic about
this segments operations in the future. We continue to believe that mainline pipe opportunities can provide strong profitability, although these projects and the profits they generate are often subject to more cyclicality than our other
service offerings. We have also taken steps to diversify our operations in this segment through other services, such as pipeline integrity and gathering system opportunities, and to restructure our gas distribution operations to improve margins. We
believe these measures, together with the potential for mainline pipe opportunities, will position us for profitable growth in this segment over the long-term.

Fiber Optic Licensing and Other Segment 
Our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment is experiencing growth primarily through geographic expansion, with a focus on
markets where secure high-speed networks are important, such as markets where enterprises, communications carriers and educational, financial services and healthcare institutions are prevalent. We continue to see opportunities for growth both in the
markets we currently serve and new markets. Our growth opportunities, however, have been affected in the education markets primarily due to challenging economic conditions, which have in the past comprised a significant portion of this
segments revenues. We believe the slowdown in the education market is due to budgetary constraints, although these constraints appear to be easing somewhat. Our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment typically generates higher margins than
our other operations, but we can give no assurance that the Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment margins will continue at historical levels. Additionally, we anticipate the need for continued capital expenditures to support the build-out of our
networks and growth of this business. The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment also provides various telecommunications infrastructure services on a limited and ancillary basis, primarily to our customers in the electric power industry. Due to
the disposition of our telecommunications subsidiaries, telecommunications services are no longer a strategic priority for the company. We will continue to provide these services to utility customers on an as needed basis. However, we believe that
expected increases in this segments revenues associated with fiber optic licensing services could be offset by decreases in other telecommunications infrastructure service revenues. 
Conclusion We continue to see growth opportunities in all of the industry segments we serve, despite continuing challenges from restrictive regulatory requirements and uncertain economic conditions. Constraints in
the capital markets have also negatively affected some of our customers plans for projects in the past and may do so in the future, which could delay, reduce or suspend future projects if funding is not available. 
We are benefiting from utilities increased spending on projects to upgrade and expand their electric power
transmission infrastructure to improve system reliability and to deliver renewable electricity from new generation sources to demand centers. Favorable industry legislation is also creating incentives and a positive environment for utilities to
invest in their electrical infrastructure, in particular for transmission infrastructure. We also expect utilities to outsource more of their work to companies like us, due in part to their aging workforce issues. We believe that we remain the
partner of choice for many utilities in need of broad infrastructure expertise, specialty equipment and workforce resources. We believe that we are one of the largest full-service providers of natural gas and oil pipeline infrastructure services in North America, which positions us to leverage opportunities driven by the
development and production of resources from North American unconventional shale developments and the Canadian oil sands. Development activity in liquid-rich shale areas is strong, increasing the need for gathering system infrastructure, and we have
seen encouraging indications that mainline pipe project activity could increase in 2013 and 2014. We also believe that our strategy to pursue midstream gathering system opportunities in liquid-rich unconventional shales, as well as the anticipated
increase in demand for our pipeline integrity, rehabilitation and replacement services from pipeline integrity initiatives, will create attractive growth potential for us and also further diversify the services provided by our Natural Gas and
Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment. Our electric distribution and gas distribution services were both
significantly affected by the uncertain economic conditions that have existed during the past three years. Demand for our electric distribution services has increased over the past several quarters as the economy has stabilized and spending on
maintenance to improve reliability has somewhat returned. We are optimistic that continued implementation of electric distribution reliability programs and the potential for improvement in the housing market will facilitate moderate growth in demand
for our electric distribution services. We expect recovery in gas distribution spending to be driven primarily by improving economic conditions, as well as increased maintenance needs from more stringent reliability regulations.

Competitive pricing environments, project delays and effects from
restrictive regulatory requirements have negatively impacted our margins in the past and could affect our margins in the future. Additionally, margins may be negatively impacted on a quarterly basis due to adverse weather conditions, timing of
project starts or completions and other factors as described in Understanding Margins above. We continue to focus on the elements of the business we can control, including costs, the margins we accept on projects, collecting receivables,
ensuring quality service, rightsizing initiatives as needed to match the markets we serve, and safely executing on the projects we are awarded. Capital expenditures for 2013 are expected to be between $200 million to $210 million, of which approximately $35 million to $45 million of these expenditures are targeted for fiber optic network
expansion, with the majority of the remaining expenditures for operating equipment. We expect 2013 capital expenditures to be funded substantially through internal cash flows, cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility. 
We continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions and investments to broaden our customer base, expand our
geographic area of operation, grow our portfolio of services and increase opportunities across our operations. We believe that additional attractive acquisition candidates exist primarily as a result of the highly fragmented nature of the industry,
the inability of many companies to expand and modernize due to capital constraints, and the desire of owners for liquidity. We also believe that our financial strength and experienced management team are attractive to acquisition candidates.
Certain international regions present significant opportunities for growth over time across many of our
operations. We are evaluating ways in which we can strategically apply our expertise to strengthen infrastructure in various foreign countries where infrastructure enhancements are increasingly important. For example, we are actively pursuing
opportunities in growth markets where we can leverage our technology or proprietary work methods, such as our energized services, to establish a presence in these markets. 
We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize upon opportunities and trends in the industries we serve because of
our proven full-service operations with broad geographic reach, financial strength and technical expertise. Additionally, we believe that these industry opportunities and trends will increase the demand for our services over the long-term; although
the actual timing, magnitude or impact of these opportunities and trends on our operating results and financial position can be difficult to predict. Uncertainty of Forward-Looking Statements and Information

ITEM7A.Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk Our primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable changes in
concentration of credit risk, interest rates and currency exchange rates. Credit
Risk.We are subject to concentrations of credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and our accounts receivable, including amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in
excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of our cash investments are managed by what we believe to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with our investment policies, these institutions are authorized to
invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality investments, which primarily include interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of
three months or less. Although we do not currently believe the principal amounts of these investments are subject to any material risk of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income we receive from these investments. In
addition, as we grant credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our customers ability to pay for services provided. This risk may be heightened as a result of the
depressed economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. However, we believe the concentration of credit risk related to trade accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted
contracts is limited because of the diversity of our customers. We perform ongoing credit risk assessments of our customers and financial institutions and in some cases we obtain collateral or other security from our customers. 
Interest Rate and Market Risk.Currently, we do not have any significant assets or
obligations with exposure to significant interest rate and market risk. Although we had credit facility borrowings outstanding at various times in 2012 which exposed us to interest rate risk, there were no credit facility borrowings outstanding at
December31, 2012. Currency Risk.We conduct operations primarily in the
U.S. and Canada. Future earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies. To minimize the need for foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge this exposure, our objective is to manage foreign currency exposure by maintaining a minimal consolidated net asset or net liability position in a currency other than the functional currency. 
We may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of our foreign currency exposures. These exposures
may include revenues generated in foreign jurisdictions and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December31, 2012.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT 
Managements Report on Financial Information and Procedures 
The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These
financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, applying certain estimates and judgments as required. 
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2012 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. 
Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

The effectiveness of Quanta Services, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears herein. 
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2012 excluded the four acquisitions we completed in 2012. Such exclusion was in accordance with SEC guidance that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may be omitted in managements report on internal control over
financial reporting, provided the acquisition took place within twelve months of managements evaluation. These acquisitions comprised approximately 21% of our consolidated assets at December31, 2012 and 25% of our consolidated revenues
for the year ended December31, 2012.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quanta Services, Inc.: 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash
flows and equity, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, management has excluded its 2012 acquisitions from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2012 because these acquisitions were made by the Company through purchase business combinations during
2012. We have also excluded the Companys 2012 acquisitions from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The 2012 acquisitions of the Company and its related subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and have
total assets and revenues which represent approximately 21% and 25%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2012.

Acquisitions 
During the first and second quarters of 2012, Quanta acquired four businesses, which included one electric power
infrastructure services company based in Canada, two electric power infrastructure services companies based in the United States and one natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services company based in the United States. During the third and fourth

infrastructure services company based in Australia. On October25, 2010, Quanta acquired Valard Construction LP and certain of its affiliated entities Valard, an electric power infrastructure services company based in Alberta, Canada. The
financial results of acquisitions have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. Dispositions On December3, 2012, Quanta sold
substantially all of its domestic telecommunications infrastructure services operations and related subsidiaries to Dycom Industries, Inc. for net proceeds of approximately $2650 million. Accordingly, Quanta has presented the results of operations,
financial position and cash flows of such telecommunications subsidiaries as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 for more information. 2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the accounts of Quanta Services, Inc. and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, which are also referred to as its operating units. The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of certain of Quantas investments in joint ventures, which are either consolidated or proportionately
consolidated, as discussed in the following summary of significant accounting policies. Investments in affiliated entities in which Quanta does not have a controlling interest, but over which Quanta has significant influence, usually because Quanta
holds a voting interest of 20% to 50%, are accounted for using the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Quanta include
Quanta and its consolidated subsidiaries. Use of Estimates and Assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the
reported amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior
to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on Quantas beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are
inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates are primarily used in Quantas assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other
intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, equity investments, loan receivables, purchase price allocations, liabilities for self-insured and other claims, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, revenue recognition for construction
contracts and fiber optic licensing, share-based compensation, operating results of reportable segments, as well as the provision benefit for income taxes and the calculation of uncertain tax positions.

Reclassifications 
Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years segment disclosures to conform to classifications used in
the current year. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $3947 million and $3153 million as of December31, 2012 and 2011. Cash
consisting of interest-bearing demand deposits is carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Quanta considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents, which are carried at
fair value. At December31, 2012 and 2011, cash equivalents were $925 million and $1659 million, which consisted primarily of money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper and are discussed further in Fair Value
Measurements below. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, cash and cash equivalents held in domestic bank accounts were approximately $2541 million and $2309 million and cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts were
approximately $1406 million and $844 million. Current and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or
note receivable is considered doubtful, and receivables are written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among others,
the customers access to capital, the customers willingness or ability to pay, general economic and market conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. Quanta considers accounts receivable delinquent after 30days but
does not generally include delinquent accounts in its analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts unless the accounts receivable have been outstanding for at least 90 days. In addition to balances that have been outstanding for 90days or
more, Quanta also includes accounts receivable balances that relate to customers in bankruptcy or with other known difficulties in its analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Material changes in Quantas customers business or
cash flows, which may be impacted by negative economic and market conditions, could affect Quantas ability to collect amounts due from them. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, Quanta had total allowances for doubtful accounts of
approximately $54 million and $38 million, all of which were included as a reduction of net current accounts receivable. Should customers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to
receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided. 
The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to retainage provisions in certain contracts are generally due
upon completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer. Based on Quantas experience with similar contracts in recent years, the majority of the retainage balances at each balance sheet date are expected to be collected within the next
twelve months. Current retainage balances as of December31, 2012 and 2011 were approximately $1806 million and $1119 million and are included in accounts receivable. Retainage balances with settlement dates beyond the next twelve months are
included in other assets, net, and as of December31, 2012 and 2011 were $225 million and $283 million. 
Within accounts receivable, Quanta recognizes unbilled receivables in circumstances such as when revenues have been
earned and recorded but the amount cannot be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date; costs have been incurred but are yet to be billed under cost-reimbursement type contracts; or amounts arise from routine lags in billing for
example, work completed one month but not billed until the next month. These balances do not include revenues accrued for work performed under fixed-price contracts as these amounts are

recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. At December31, 2012 and 2011, the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts receivable
were approximately $1275 million and $1211 million. Inventories 
Inventories consist primarily of parts and supplies held for use in the ordinary course of business, which are valued by
Quanta at the lower of cost or market as determined by using either the first-in, first-out FIFO method or the average costing method. Inventories also include certain job specific materials not yet installed which are valued using the specific
identification method. Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated
salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation expense related to property and
equipment was approximately $1203 million, $1099 million and $1012 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Quanta capitalizes costs associated with internally developed or constructed assets primarily associated with fiber optic licensing networks and software systems for internal applications. Capitalized
costs include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal-use assets, as well as payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to placing the
assets into service. Capitalization of such costs is recorded to construction work-in-process beginning when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for
its intended purpose, at which point in time the asset is placed into service. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, approximately $190 million and $141 million related to fiber optic licensing networks and $21 million and $80 million
associated with internally developed software systems were recorded in construction work-in-process. These capitalized costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the economic useful life of the asset, beginning when the asset is ready for
its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. 
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and
betterments, which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated over the adjusted remaining useful life of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, fair value would be
determined by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset. Management compares the estimated fair value of the asset to the assets carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. The effect
of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value in the period incurred. During 2010, approximately $82 million in net property and equipment was reclassified to prepaid expenses and other current assets as they were deemed to be assets held for sale. In conjunction with this

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
assessment, approximately $01 million in net losses from the impairment of assets held for sale were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010. During 2012 and 2011, there
was no property and equipment classified as assets held for sale. Other Assets, Net 
Other assets, net consists primarily of equity investments, debt issuance costs, long term receivables, non-current
inventory, refundable security deposits for leased properties and insurance claims in excess of deductibles that are due from Quantas insurers. Debt Issuance Costs Capitalized debt issuance costs
related to Quantas credit facility and any other debt outstanding at a given balance sheet date are included in other assets, net and are amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective agreements
giving rise to the debt issuance costs, which Quanta believes approximates the effective interest rate method. During 2011, Quanta incurred $41 million of debt issuance costs related to the amendment and restatement of its credit facility and
recorded a $03 million charge to interest expense for the write-off of a portion of the debt issuance costs related to the prior facility. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, capitalized debt issuance costs were $44 million and $44 million,
with accumulated amortization of $13 million and $04 million. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, amortization expense related to capitalized debt issuance costs was $09 million, $09 million and $06 million, respectively.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
Quanta has recorded goodwill in connection with its acquisitions. Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for
impairment, which Quanta performs at the operating unit level. Each of Quantas operating units is organized into one of three internal divisions, which are closely aligned with Quantas reportable segments, based on the predominant type
of work performed by the operating unit at the point in time the divisional designation is made. Because separate measures of assets and cash flows are not produced or utilized by management to evaluate segment performance, Quantas impairment
assessments of its goodwill do not include any consideration of assets and cash flows by reportable segment. As a result, Quanta has determined that its individual operating units represent its reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill
impairments. As further discussed in Note 3, Quanta adopted an update issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB, which gives entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step fair value-based impairment test described below. If an entity believes that, as a result of its
qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. An entity can choose to perform the
qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. An entity can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the
qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. This update also includes new qualitative indicators that replaced those previously used to determine whether an annual or interim goodwill impairment test is required to be performed. For instance,
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, declining financial performance, or a sustained decrease in share price, among other things, may trigger the need for annual or interim impairment testing of goodwill associated with one or all of the
reporting units. Quantas goodwill impairment assessment is performed at year-end, or more frequently if
events or circumstances arise which indicate that goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a decrease in Quantas market capitalization below book value, a significant change in business climate or loss of a significant customer, as well
85 Table of Contents

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
as the qualitative indicators referenced above, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of goodwill for one or all of its reporting units. The first step of the two-step fair
value-based test involves comparing the fair value of each of Quantas reporting units with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second
step compares the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of its goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to
goodwill with a corresponding charge to operating expense. Quanta determines the fair value of its reporting
units using a weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in managements opinion, this method currently results
in the most accurate calculation of a reporting units fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth
rates, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. Quanta believes the estimates and assumptions used in its impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market
information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. 
Under the discounted cash flow method, Quanta determines fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each
reporting unit, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Cash flow projections are
derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts typically a two-year model plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth
rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur, along with a terminal value derived from the reporting units earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA. The EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit
are based on trailing twelve-month comparable industry data. Under the market multiple and market
capitalization approaches, Quanta determines the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting units projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical
calculations using either a one, two or three year average. For the market capitalization approach, Quanta adds a reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit in an orderly
transaction between market participants. The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by reporting
unit were used to determine fair value under the three approaches discussed herein. The following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of Quantas reporting units at December31, 2012,

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
For recently acquired reporting units, a step one impairment test may
indicate an implied fair value that is substantially similar to the reporting units carrying value. Such similarities in value are generally an indication that managements estimates of future cash flows associated with the recently
acquired reporting unit remain relatively consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its initial fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2012, a goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of Quantas reporting units,
which indicated that the implied fair value of each of Quantas reporting units, other than recently acquired reporting units, was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Following the analysis, management concluded that no impairment
was indicated at any reporting unit. As discussed generally above, when evaluating the 2012 step one impairment test results, management considered many factors in determining whether or not an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit was
reasonably likely to occur in future periods, including future market conditions and the economic environment in which Quantas reporting units were operating. Additionally, management considered the sensitivity of its fair value estimates to
changes in certain valuation assumptions and, after giving consideration to at least a 10% decrease in the fair value of each of Quantas reporting units, the results of the assessment at December31, 2012 did not change. However,
circumstances such as market declines, unfavorable economic conditions, the loss of a major customer or other factors could impact the valuation of goodwill in future periods. 
The goodwill analysis performed for each reporting unit was based on estimates and industry comparables obtained from the
electric power, natural gas and oil pipeline and fiber optic licensing industries, and no impairment was indicated. The 15-year discounted cash flow model used for fiber optic licensing is based on the long-term nature of the underlying fiber optic
network licensing agreements. Quanta assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow approach in all
periods to reflect increased expectations of market value being determined from a held and used model. Discount rates for the 2012 and 2011 analyses declined from those of the year prior for the operating units providing predominately
electric power and natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services due to generally more favorable market conditions for these operating units in 2012 as compared to 2011 and in 2011 as compared to 2010. Additionally, discount rates for the 2012
analysis declined from those of the prior years for the operating unit providing predominately fiber optic licensing due to generally more favorable market conditions for this operating unit in 2012 as compared to 2011 and 2010. 
Quantas intangible assets include customer relationships, backlog, trade names, non-compete agreements, patented
rights and developed technology, all subject to amortization, along with other intangible assets not subject to amortization. The value of customer relationships is estimated as of the date a business is acquired based on the value-in-use concept
utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration given to customer
contract renewals, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to Quantas business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. Quanta values backlog for acquired businesses as of the acquisition date based upon the
contractual nature of the backlog within each service line, using the income approach to discount back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog. The value of trade names is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method of the
income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset. 
Quanta amortizes intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible
asset, or on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among 
87 Table of Contents

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
other things, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of intangible assets. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and
its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities 
In the normal course of business, Quanta enters into various types of investment arrangements, each having unique terms
and conditions. These investments may include equity interests held by Quanta in business entities, including general or limited partnerships, contractual joint ventures, or other forms of equity participation. These investments may also include
Quantas participation in different finance structures such as the extension of loans to project specific entities, the acquisition of convertible notes issued by project specific entities, or other strategic financing arrangements. Quanta
determines whether such investments involve a variable interest entity VIE based on the characteristics of the subject entity. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, then management determines if Quanta is the primary beneficiary of the entity
and whether or not consolidation of the VIE is required. The primary beneficiary consolidating the VIE must normally have both ithe power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the VIEs economic performance
and iithe obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE, in either case that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When Quanta is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated and
the other partys equity interest in the VIE is accounted for as a noncontrolling interest. In cases where Quanta determines that it has an undivided interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and profits of an unincorporated VIE e.g., a
general partnership interest, such amounts are consolidated on a basis proportional to Quantas ownership interest in the unincorporated entity. Investments in entities of which Quanta is not the primary beneficiary, but over which Quanta has the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Quantas share of net income or losses from unconsolidated equity investments is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by
assessing whether any decline in the fair value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, factors such as the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment and the inability of the
investee to sustain an earnings capacity are evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized. Any impairment losses would be recognized in other expense. Equity method investments are carried at original cost and are included
in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheet and are adjusted for Quantas proportionate share of the investees income, losses and distributions. 
On June22, 2011, Quanta acquired an equity ownership interest of approximately 39% in Howard Midstream Energy
Partners, LLC HEP for an initial capital contribution of $350 million. HEP is engaged in the business of owning, operating and constructing midstream plant and pipeline assets in the natural gas and oil pipeline industry. HEP commenced operations
in June 2011 with the acquisitions of Texas Pipeline LLC, a pipeline operator in the Eagle Ford shale region of South Texas, and Bottom Line Services, LLC, a construction services company. Quanta contributed an additional $523 million in the
aggregate to HEP in March and April 2012 in exchange for an aggregate 45,435 Class D units of HEP. Howard Midstream Energy Partners, LLC used the proceeds of Quantas investment, together with capital contributed by other third party investors,
to purchase additional pipeline assets in the Eagle Ford shale region. As a result of this transaction and the other third party investments in HEP, Quantas total equity ownership interest in HEP decreased from approximately 39% at
March31, 2012 to approximately 31%. Quanta accounts for this investment using the equity method of accounting. During the fourth quarter of 2012, HEP sold its interest in Bottom Line Services, LLC and is expected to use the proceeds from the
transaction for other strategic development opportunities.

Revenue Recognition 
Infrastructure Services Through its Electric Power Infrastructure Services and Natural Gas and Pipeline
Infrastructure Services segments, Quanta designs, installs and maintains networks for customers in the electric power and natural gas and oil pipeline industries. These services may be provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and
maintenance contracts and fixed price and non-fixed price installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly or time and materials basis or fixed price or lump sum basis, and the final terms and
prices of these contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer. Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue as units are
completed based on pricing established between Quanta and the customer for each unit of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts,
Quanta recognizes revenue on an input basis, as labor hours are incurred and services are performed. Revenues
from fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues for the
entire project. Such contracts provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate Quanta for services rendered, which may be measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or some other measure of progress. Contract
costs include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the material associated with Quantas
work is owner-furnished and is therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost estimation process is based on professional knowledge and experience of Quantas engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Changes in
job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence managements assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore Quantas profit recognition.
Changes in these factors may result in revisions to costs and income, and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses
are determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Quanta may incur costs subject to
change orders, whether approved or unapproved by the customer, and/or claims related to certain contracts. Quanta determines the probability that such costs will be recovered based upon evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific
discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or verbal approvals. Quanta treats items as a cost of contract performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is
probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, Quanta had approximately $2050 million and $773 million of change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price
adjustments on certain contracts which were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. These contract price adjustments represent managements best estimate of additional contract revenues which have been earned and
which management believes are probable of collection. The amounts ultimately realized by Quanta upon final acceptance by its customers could be higher or lower than such estimated amounts. 
The current asset Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents
revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price contracts. The current liability Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed
price contracts.

Fiber Optic Licensing The fiber optic licensing
business constructs and licenses the right to use fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under those
agreements, customers are provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the facility owned and maintained by Quanta. Revenues, including any initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over the
expected length of the agreements, including probable renewal periods. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, initial fees and advance billings on these licensing agreements not yet recorded in revenue were $464 million and $474 million and are
recognized as deferred revenue, with $377 million and $383 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Minimum future licensing revenues expected to be recognized by Quanta pursuant to these agreements at
December31, 2012 are as follows in thousands:   Year Ending December 31 2013 84,104 2014 62,014 2015 40,234 2016 31,277 2017 23,443 Thereafter 125,225 
Fixed non-cancelable minimum licensing revenues 366,297 
Income Taxes 
Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recorded for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the underlying
assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. Quanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established
for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. The estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Quanta considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from
these estimates, Quanta may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated. Quanta records reserves
for income taxes related to certain tax positions in those instances where Quanta considers it more likely than not that additional taxes may be due in excess of amounts reflected on income tax returns filed. When recording reserves for expected tax
consequences of uncertain positions, Quanta assumes that taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Quanta continually reviews exposure to additional tax obligations, and as further information is known or events
occur, changes in tax reserves may be recorded. To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and are classified in the provision for income taxes.
As of December31, 2012, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax
positions was $512 million, an increase from December31, 2011 of $39 million. This increase in unrecognized tax benefits primarily results from a $154 million increase due to the tax positions expected to be taken for 2012  90 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
partially offset by a $120 million decrease due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations for the 2008 tax year. Although the Internal Revenue Service completed its examination
related to calendar year 2009 during 2012, certain subsidiaries remain under examination by various state and Canadian tax authorities for multiple periods, and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could therefore increase or decrease as a result
of settlements of these audits or as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. Quanta believes that it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease up to $115 million as a result
of settlements of these audits or as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. The
income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, Quanta is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in its future
consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive income. Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and
diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalent
would be antidilutive. Collective Bargaining Agreements 
Several of Quantas operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements with unions that
represent certain of their employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. The agreements require the operating units to
pay specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts. Quantas multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified
in the collective bargaining agreements usually on an annual basis, and contributions are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis based on its union employee payrolls, which cannot be determined for future periods because the
location and number of union employees that Quanta employs at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects Quanta has ongoing at any time and the need for union resources in connection with those
projects. Stock-Based Compensation 
Quanta recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock based compensation based on the fair value of the awards
granted, net of estimated forfeitures, at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of Quantas common stock on the date of grant. An estimate of
future forfeitures is required in determining the period expense. Quanta uses historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate; however, these estimates are subject to change and may impact the value that will ultimately be realized as compensation
expense. The resulting compensation expense from discretionary awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, while compensation expense from performance-based awards is
recognized using the graded vesting method over the requisite service period. Restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until vesting. During the restriction period, holders are entitled
to vote and receive dividends on such shares. The cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for restricted stock and stock options excess tax benefit are classified as financing cash flows.
Compensation expense associated with liability based awards such as restricted stock units RSUs that are
expected to be settled in cash is recognized based on a remeasurement of the fair value of the award at the end of

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
each reporting period. RSUs granted by Quanta under the Plans are intended to provide plan participants with cash performance incentives that are substantially equivalent to the risks and rewards
of equity ownership in Quanta. RSUs vest over a designated period, typically three years, and are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, primarily termination of service. Upon vesting of RSUs, the holders receive for each vested RSU either
ione share of Quanta common stock, or iian amount in cash equal to the fair market value on the vesting date of one share of Quanta common stock, as specified in the applicable award agreement. Generally, RSUs granted to plan
participants residing in the U.S. provide for settlement in shares of common stock, and RSUs granted to plan participants residing outside the U.S. provide for settlement in cash. 
Functional Currency and Translation of Financial Statements 
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority of Quantas operations, which are primarily located
within the United States. The functional currency for Quantas foreign operations, which are primarily located in Canada, is typically the currency of the country in which the foreign operating unit is located. Generally, the currency in which
the operating unit transacts a majority of its activities, including billings, financing, payroll and other expenditures, would be considered the functional currency. Under the relevant accounting guidance, the treatment of foreign currency
translation gains or losses is dependent upon managements determination of the functional currency of each operating unit, which involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the operating unit. In preparing
the consolidated financial statements, Quanta translates the financial statements of its foreign operating units from their functional currency into U.S. dollars. Statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows are translated at
average monthly rates, while balance sheets are translated at the month-end exchange rates. The translation of the balance sheets at the month-end exchange rates results in translation gains or losses. If transactions are denominated in the
operating units functional currency, the translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive income loss. If transactions are not denominated in the
operating units functional currency, the translation gains and losses are included within the statement of operations. 
Derivatives From time to time, Quanta enters into forward currency contracts that qualify as derivatives in order to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain
forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions. Quanta does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes; however, for accounting purposes, certain transactions may not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting. For a
hedge to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, a hedge must be documented at the inception of the contract, with the objective and strategy stated, along with an explicit description of the methodology used to assess hedge effectiveness.
The dates or periods for the expected forecasted events and the nature of the exposure involved including quantitative measures of the size of the exposure must also be documented. At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedge
must be deemed to be highly effective at minimizing the risk of the identified exposure. Effectiveness measures relate the gains or losses of the derivative to changes in the cash flows associated with the hedged item, and the forecasted
transaction must be probable of occurring. For forward contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, Quanta
accounts for the change in fair value of the forward contracts directly in equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Any ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period in which ineffectiveness
occurs. For instance, if a forward contract is discontinued as a cash flow hedge because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period, the related amounts in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss would be reclassified to other income expense in the consolidated statement

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
of operations in the period such determination is made. When a forecasted transaction occurs, the portion of the accumulated gain or loss applicable to the forecasted transaction is reclassified
from equity to earnings. Changes in fair value related to transactions that do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are recorded in the consolidated results of operations and are included in other income expense. 
Comprehensive Income Components of comprehensive income include all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from changes in Quantas capital related accounts. Quanta records other comprehensive income
loss, net of tax, for foreign currency translation adjustments related to its foreign operations and for other revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are included in comprehensive income, but excluded from net income. 
Litigation Costs and Reserves Quanta records reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Costs incurred for litigation are expensed as incurred. Further details
are presented in Note15. Fair Value Measurements 
The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value
due to the short-term nature of these instruments. For disclosure purposes, qualifying assets and liabilities are categorized into three broad levels based on the priority of the inputs used to determine their fair values. The fair value hierarchy
gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3. All of Quantas cash equivalents are categorized as Level 1
assets at December31, 2012 and 2011, as all values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that Quanta has the ability to access. 
In connection with Quantas acquisitions, identifiable intangible assets acquired include goodwill, backlog,
customer relationships, trade names, covenants not-to-compete, patented rights and developed technology. Quanta utilizes the fair value premise as the primary basis for its valuation procedures, which is a market-based approach to determine the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Quanta periodically engages the services of an independent valuation firm when a new business is acquired to assist
management with this valuation process, including assistance with the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the development of market-based valuation assumptions. Based on these considerations, management utilizes various valuation
methods, including an income approach, a market approach and a cost approach, to determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired based on the appropriateness of each method in relation to the type of asset being valued. The assumptions used
in these valuation methods are analyzed and compared, where possible, to available market data, such as industry-based weighted average costs of capital and discount rates, trade name royalty rates, public company valuation multiples and recent
market acquisition multiples. The level of inputs used for these fair value measurements is the lowest level Level 3. Quanta believes that these valuation methods appropriately represent the methods that would be used by other market participants
in determining fair value. Quanta uses fair value measurements on a routine basis in its assessment of assets
classified as goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets held and used. In accordance with its annual impairment test during the quarter ended December31, 2012, the carrying amounts of such assets, including goodwill, were
compared to their fair values. The inputs used for fair value measurements for goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets held and used are the lowest level Level 3 inputs, and Quanta uses the assistance of third party specialists to
develop valuation assumptions. 
93 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Quanta also uses fair value measurements in connection with the
valuation of its investments in private company equity interests and financing instruments. These valuations require significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature
of such assets. Typically, the initial costs of these investments are considered to represent fair market value, as such amounts are negotiated between willing market participants. On a quarterly basis, Quanta performs an evaluation of its
investments to determine if an other-than-temporary decline in the value of each investment has occurred and whether the recorded amount of each investment will be realizable. If an other-than-temporary decline in the value of an investment occurs,
a fair value analysis would be performed to determine the degree to which the investment was impaired and a corresponding charge to earnings would be recorded during the period. These types of fair market value assessments are similar to other
nonrecurring fair value measures used by Quanta, which include the use of significant judgment and available relevant market data. Such market data may include observations of the valuation of comparable companies, risk adjusted discount rates and
an evaluation of the expected performance of the underlying portfolio asset, including historical and projected levels of profitability or cash flows. In addition, a variety of additional factors will be reviewed by management, including, but not
limited to, contemporaneous financing and sales transactions with third parties, changes in market outlook and the third-party financing environment.  3.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: 
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements 
On January1, 2012, Quanta adopted an update issued by the FASB that amends certain accounting and disclosure
requirements related to fair value measurements. Additional disclosure requirements in the update include: 1for Level 3 fair value measurements, quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation
processes used by the entity, and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs; 2for an entitys use of a nonfinancial asset that is different from the assets highest and
best use, the reason for the difference; 3for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required, the fair value hierarchy level in which the fair value measurements were determined; and
4the disclosure of all transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The adoption of the update did not have a material impact on Quantas financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Also on January1, 2012, Quanta adopted an update issued by the FASB that eliminates the option to present the
components of other comprehensive income only as part of the statement of equity. This guidance is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements by requiring that such amounts be presented either in a
single continuous statement of income and comprehensive income or separately in consecutive statements of income and comprehensive income. Quanta now presents separate consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a result of adopting the
update. On January1, 2012, Quanta also adopted an update issued by the FASB that gives entities the
option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of
a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. An entity can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. An
entity can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. The update also includes
new qualitative indicators that replace those previously used to determine whether an annual or interim goodwill impairment test is required to be performed. The adoption of the update did not have a material impact on Quantas financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
In July 2012, the FASB issued an update that gives entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that its indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If, based on its qualitative assessment, an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that
the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. The update is
effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. Quanta does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its
consolidated financial statements.  4.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS: 
On December3, 2012, Quanta sold substantially all of its domestic telecommunications
infrastructure services operations and related subsidiaries to Dycom Industries, Inc. for net proceeds of approximately $2650 million. Quanta recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $180 million and a corresponding tax expense of approximately
$322 million, which resulted in a loss on the sale, net of tax, of $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Quanta has presented the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of such telecommunications subsidiaries as
discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The results of operations of these telecommunications subsidiaries were previously included primarily in the Telecommunications Infrastructure
Services segment. Summarized financial information for discontinued operations is shown below in thousands:
Year Ended December31 2012 2011 2010 Revenues 493,233 430,065 301,785 Income from discontinued operations before taxes 46,576 22,862 12,296 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations before taxes 17,962 Provision for income taxes 47,603 8,858 1,813 
Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes 16,935 14,004 10,483 
In connection with the sale of the telecommunications operations, Quanta will remain
liable for all income related taxes and insured claims against the subsidiaries outstanding or arising as of December3, 2012. Additionally, Quanta accelerated the vesting of unvested shares of restricted stock held by certain employees of the
disposed telecommunications subsidiaries on December3, 2012, the closing date of the sale. Accordingly, Quanta recorded incremental expense related to this accelerated vesting of $37 million during the fourth quarter of 2012. This incremental
expense is included in income from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2012.

ACQUISITIONS: 
2012 Acquisitions 
In the first and second quarters of 2012, Quanta acquired four businesses, which included one electric power
infrastructure services company based in Canada, two electric power infrastructure services companies based in the United States and one natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services company based in the United States. These businesses have been
reflected in Quantas consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $575 million in cash, 1,927,113shares of Quanta common stock
valued at approximately $373 million and the repayment of $110 million in debt. These acquisitions allow Quanta to expand its capabilities and scope of services internationally and in the United States. The financial results of these businesses
are generally included in the corresponding segment. 2011 Acquisitions 
In the third and fourth quarters of 2011, Quanta acquired five businesses, which included three electric power
infrastructure services companies based in Canada, one electric power infrastructure services company based in the United States and one natural gas and pipeline infrastructure services company based in Australia. These businesses have been
reflected in Quantas consolidated financial statements as of their respective acquisition dates. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $808 million in cash, 1,939,813shares of Quanta common stock
valued at approximately $324 million and the repayment of $34 million in debt. These acquisitions allow Quanta to further expand its capabilities and scope of services internationally and in the United States. The financial results of these
businesses are generally included in the corresponding segment. 2010 Acquisition 
On October25, 2010, Quanta acquired Valard. In connection with the acquisition, Quantapaid the former owners
of Valard approximately $1189 million in cash andissued 623,720shares of Quanta common stock and3,909,110 exchangeable shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta. In addition, Quanta issued one share of Quanta SeriesF
preferred stock to a voting trust on behalf of the holders of the exchangeable shares. The Series F preferred stock provides the holders of exchangeable shares with voting rights in Quanta common stock equivalent to the number of exchangeable shares
outstanding at any time. The aggregate value of the common stock and exchangeable shares issued was approximately $834 million. The exchangeable shares are substantially equivalent to, and exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for, Quanta common
stock. As part of the consideration paid for Valard, Quanta also repaid $128 million in Valard debt at the closing of the acquisition. As this transaction was effective October25, 2010, the results of Valard have been included in the
consolidated financial statements beginning on such date. This acquisition allows Quanta to further expand its capabilities and scope of services in Canada. Valards financial results are generally included in Quantas Electric Power
Infrastructure Services segment.

The following table summarizes the aggregate consideration paid for the
2012 and 2011 acquisitions and presents the allocation of these amounts to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the respective acquisition dates. This allocation requires the significant use
of estimates and is based on information that was available to management at the time these consolidated financial statements were prepared in thousands.  2012 2011 AllAcquisitions AllAcquisitions Consideration Value of Quanta common stock issued 37,291 32,368 Cash paid 68,507 84,208

The fair value of current assets acquired in 2012 includes accounts receivable with a
fair value of $153 million. The fair value of current assets acquired in 2011 included accounts receivable with a fair value of $161 million. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of the fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The 2012, 2011 and 2010 acquisitions strategically expanded
Quantas Canadian service offering, added an Australian service offering and enhanced its domestic electric power and natural gas and oil pipeline service offerings, which Quanta believes contributes to the recognition of the goodwill. In
connection with the 2012 acquisitions, goodwill of $575 million was recorded for reporting units included within Quantas electric power division and $73 million was recorded for the reporting unit included within Quantas natural gas
and pipeline division at December31, 2012. In connection with the 2011 acquisitions, goodwill of $349 million was recorded for reporting units included within Quantas electric power division and $89 million was recorded for the
reporting unit included within Quantas natural gas and pipeline division at December31, 2011. Goodwill of approximately $529 million and $131 million is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes related to the businesses
acquired in 2012 and 2011.

PER SHARE INFORMATION: Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalent would be antidilutive. The amounts used to compute the basic and diluted
earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are illustrated below in thousands:  Year Ended December31 2012 2011 2010 AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCK Net income from continuing operations 289,694 118,511 142,693 Net income from discontinued operations 16,935 14,004 10,483

Weighted average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share 212,835 213,168 211,796 
For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, there were no adjustments
required to derive Quantas net income attributable to common stock. For the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, a nominal number of stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
exercise prices of the stock options were greater than the average market price of Quantas common stock. The 39million exchangeable shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta that were issued pursuant to the acquisition of Valard on
October25, 2010, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis with shares of Quanta common stock, are included in weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the full years of 2012 and 2011 and are
weighted for the portion of 2010 they were outstanding. Shares of Quanta common stock placed in escrow related to a previous acquisition are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2011 and
2010, and are weighted based on the portion of the year they were held in escrow. These shares were released from escrow on April4, 2011. For the year ended December31, 2010, the effect of assuming conversion of Quantas 375%
convertible subordinated notes due 2026 375% Notes would have been antidilutive and therefore the shares issuable upon conversion were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. The 375% Notes were not outstanding after
May1, 2010 and therefore had no impact on diluted shares during the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011.

facility maturing on August2, 2016. Up to $1000 million of the facility is available for revolving loans and letters of credit in certain alternative currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar. Borrowings under the credit agreement are to be
used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. Quanta entered into the credit agreement on August2, 2011, which amended and restated its prior credit agreement.
As of December31, 2012, Quanta had approximately $1832 million of letters of credit issued and no
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility. The remaining $5168 million was available for borrowings or issuing new letters of credit. Information on credit facility borrowings and the applicable interest rates during the year ended

025% to 150%, as determined based on Quantas Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus 125% to 250%, as
determined based on Quantas Consolidated Leverage Ratio, plus, if applicable, any Mandatory Cost. Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of 125% to 250%, based on Quantas

the ratio of Quantas total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement. For purposes of calculating both the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the maximum senior debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio discussed below,
total funded debt and total senior debt are reduced by all unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents as defined in the credit agreement held by Quanta in excess of $250 million. The Base Rate equals the highest of ithe Federal Funds Rate as
defined in the credit agreement plus 1/2 of 1%, iiBank of Americas prime rate and iiithe Eurocurrency Rate plus 100%. Subject to certain exceptions, the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of Quanta and its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of
Quantas wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of the direct foreign subsidiaries of Quanta or its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries. Quantas wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts
due under the credit agreement. Subject to certain conditions, at any time Quanta maintains a corporate credit rating that is BBB- stable or higher by Standard Poors Rating Services and a corporate family rating that is Baa3
stable or higher by Moodys Investors Services, all collateral will be automatically released from these liens. The credit agreement contains certain covenants, including a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, in each case as specified in the credit agreement. The credit
agreement also contains a maximum senior debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio, as specified in the credit agreement, which will be in effect at any time that the collateral securing the credit agreement has been and remains released. The credit
agreement limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, capital expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on assets. The credit agreement also includes
limits on the payment of dividends and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock. As of December31, 2012, Quanta was in compliance with all of the covenants in the
credit agreement. The credit agreement provides for customary events of default and includes cross-default
provisions with Quantas underwriting, continuing indemnity and security agreement with its sureties and all of Quantas other debt instruments exceeding $300 million in borrowings or availability. If an event of default as defined in
the credit agreement occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, amounts outstanding under the credit agreement may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and
payable. Prior to August2, 2011, Quanta had a credit agreement that provided for a $4750 million
senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on September19, 2012. Subject to the conditions specified in the prior credit agreement, borrowings under the prior credit facility were to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and
other general corporate purposes. The entire unused portion of the prior credit facility was available for the issuance of letters of credit.

Amounts borrowed under the prior credit facility bore interest, at
Quantas option, at a rate equal to either athe Eurodollar Rate as defined in the prior credit agreement plus 0875% to 175%, as determined by the ratio of Quantas total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the
prior credit agreement, or bthe base rate as described below plus 000% to 075%, as determined by the ratio of Quantas total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the prior credit facility were subject
to a letter of credit fee of 0875% to 175%, based on the ratio of Quantas total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Quanta was also subject to a commitment fee of 015% to 035%, based on the ratio of its total funded debt to Consolidated
EBITDA, on any unused availability under the prior credit facility. The base rate equaled the higher of ithe Federal Funds Rate as defined in the prior credit agreement plus 1/2 of 1% or iithe banks prime rate. 
375%Convertible Subordinated Notes 
As of December31, 2012 and 2011, none of Quantas 375% Notes were outstanding. The 375% Notes were originally
issued in April 2006 in an aggregate principal amount of $1438 million and required semi-annual interest payments on April30 and October30 until maturity. On May14, 2010, Quanta redeemed all of the $1438 million aggregate
principal amount outstanding of the 375% Notes at a redemption price of 101607% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. The redemption resulted in a payment of the
aggregate redemption price of $1461 million and the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $71 million. Included in the loss on early extinguishment of debt was a non-cash loss of $35 million related to the
difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the 375% Notes, calculated as of the date of redemption, the payment of $23 million representing the 1607% redemption premium above par value and a non-cash loss of $13
million from the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 375% Notes.  10.

The valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets at December31, 2012, 2011
and 2010 was $93 million, $88 million and $114 million, respectively. These valuation allowances relate to state net operating loss carryforwards, foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The net change in
the total valuation allowance for each of the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was an increase of $05 million, a decrease of $26 million and an increase of $28 million, respectively. The valuation allowance was established
primarily as a result of uncertainty in Quantas outlook as to future taxable income in particular tax jurisdictions. Quanta believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets, net of existing
valuation allowances. At December31, 2012, Quanta had state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $171 million. These carryforwards will expire as follows: 2013, $06 million; 2014, $08 million; 2015, $02 million; 2016, $02 million; 2017, $05 million and $148 million thereafter. A
valuation allowance of $49 million has been recorded against certain state net operating loss carryforwards. 
Through December31, 2012, Quanta has not provided U.S.income taxes on approximately $1050 million of
unremitted foreign earnings because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.It is not practicable to determine the amount of any additional U.S.tax liability that may result if Quanta decides to no longer
indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings outside the U.S. If management intentions or U.S. tax law changes in the future, there may be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes, as a result of recording an incremental tax
liability, in the period such change occurs. A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefit balances is as

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
For the year ended December31, 2012, the $120 million reduction
is primarily due to the expiration of certain federal and state statutes of limitations for the 2008 tax year. For the year ended December31, 2011, the $86 million reduction is primarily due to the expiration of certain federal and state
statutes of limitations for the 2007 tax year and the $49 million reduction primarily relates to settlement with tax authorities regarding a foreign tax credit position taken in a pre-acquisition tax return of an acquired business. For the year
ended December31, 2010, the $103 million reduction is primarily due to the expiration of certain federal and state statutes of limitations for the 2006 tax year. 
The balances of unrecognized tax benefits, the amount of related interest and penalties and what Quanta believes to be

Quanta classifies interest and penalties within the provision for income taxes. Quanta
recognized $11 million of interest income, $07 million of interest expense and $22 million of interest income in the provision for income taxes for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
Quanta is subject to income tax in the United States, multiple state jurisdictions and some foreign jurisdictions. Quanta
remains open to examination by the IRS for tax years 2009 through 2012 as these statutes of limitations have not yet expired. Quanta does not consider any state in which it does business to be a major tax jurisdiction. 
11. EQUITY: 
Exchangeable Shares and Series F Preferred Stock 
In connection with the acquisition of Valard as discussed in Note 5, certain former owners of Valard received exchangeable
shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta which may be exchanged at the option of the holder for Quanta common stock on a one-for-one basis. The holders of exchangeable shares can make an exchange only once in any calendar quarter and must exchange
a minimum of either 50,000 shares or, if less, the total number of remaining exchangeable shares registered in the name of the holder making the request. Quanta also issued one share of Quanta SeriesF preferred stock to a voting trust on
behalf of the holders of the exchangeable shares. The SeriesF preferred stock provides the holders of the exchangeable shares voting rights in Quanta common stock equivalent to the number of exchangeable shares outstanding at any time. The
combination of the exchangeable shares and the share of SeriesF preferred stock gives the holders of the exchangeable shares rights equivalent to Quanta common stockholders with respect to dividends, voting and other economic rights.

Limited Vote Common Stock 
Effective May19, 2011, each outstanding share of Quantas Limited Vote Common Stock was reclassified and
converted into 105 shares of Quanta common stock, as set forth in a Certificate of Amendment to Restated Certificate of Incorporation approved by the stockholders of Quanta and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on
May19, 2011. At December31, 2012 and 2011, there were no shares of Limited Vote Common Stock outstanding. The Certificate of Amendment also eliminated entirely the class of Limited Vote Common Stock. The shares of Limited Vote Common
Stock had rights similar to shares of common stock, except with respect to voting. Holders of Limited Vote Common Stock were entitled to vote as a separate class to elect one director and did not vote in the election of other directors. Holders of
Limited Vote Common Stock were entitled to one-tenth of one vote for each share held on all other matters submitted for stockholder action. Shares of Limited Vote Common Stock were convertible into Quanta common stock upon disposition by the holder
of such shares in accordance with the transfer restrictions applicable to such shares. During the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, noshares of Limited Vote Common Stock were converted to common stock upon transfer. In 2011,
432,485 shares of Limited Vote Common Stock were reclassified and converted into 454,107 shares of Quanta common stock pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment approved by the stockholders. In 2010, Quanta issued an aggregate 241,300shares of
its common stock in exchange for an aggregate 229,808shares of Limited Vote Common Stock through voluntary exchanges initiated by individual stockholders. Treasury Stock Under the stock incentive plans
described in Note12, the tax withholding obligations of employees upon vesting of restricted stock are typically satisfied by Quanta making such tax payments and withholding a number of vested shares having a value on the date of vesting equal
to the tax withholding obligation. As a result, Quanta withheld 370,007shares of Quanta common stock in 2012 with a total market value of $67 million, 299,804shares of Quanta common stock in 2011 with a total market value of $66
million and 243,821shares of Quanta common stock in 2010 with a total market value of $46 million, in each case for settlement of employee tax liabilities. These shares and the related cost to acquire them were accounted for as an adjustment
to the balance of treasury stock. During the second quarter of 2011, Quantas board of directors
approved a stock repurchase program authorizing Quanta to purchase, from time to time, up to $1500 million of its outstanding common stock. The program was completed in August 2011 and resulted in the repurchase of 81million shares of
Quantas common stock at an aggregate cost of $1495 million. These shares and the related cost to acquire them were accounted for as an adjustment to the balance of treasury stock. Under Delaware corporate law, treasury stock is not entitled
to vote or be counted for quorum purposes. Noncontrolling Interests 
Quanta holds investments in several joint ventures that provide infrastructure services under specific customer contracts.
Each joint venture is owned equally by its members. Quanta has determined that certain of these joint ventures are variable interest entities, with Quanta providing the majority of the infrastructure services to the joint venture, which management
believes most significantly influences the economic performance of the joint venture. Management has concluded that Quanta is the primary beneficiary of each of these joint ventures and has accounted for each on a consolidated basis. The other
parties equity interests in these joint ventures have been accounted for as a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements. Income attributable to the other joint venture members has been accounted for as a reduction of
reported net income attributable to

common stock in the amount of $160 million, $119 million and $24 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Equity in the consolidated assets and
liabilities of these joint ventures that is attributable to the other joint venture members has been accounted for as a component of noncontrolling interests within total equity in the accompanying balance sheets. 
The carrying value of the investments held by Quanta in all of its variable interest entities was approximately $54
million and $73 million at December31, 2012 and 2011. The carrying value of investments held by the noncontrolling interests in these variable interest entities at December31, 2012 and 2011 was $54 million and $73 million. During the
years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, distributions to noncontrolling interests were $180 million, $60 million and $24 million. There were no other changes in equity as a result of transfers to or from the noncontrolling interests.
See Note 15 for further disclosures related to Quantas joint venture arrangements. 
12.EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION: 
Stock Incentive Plans 
On May19, 2011, Quantas stockholders approved the Quanta Services, Inc. 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan
the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan provides for the award of non-qualified stock options, incentive qualified stock options ISOs, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock bonus awards, performance compensation
awards including cash bonus awards or any combination of the foregoing. The purpose of the 2011 Plan is to provide participants with additional performance incentives by increasing their proprietary interest in Quanta. Employees, directors,
officers, consultants or advisors of Quanta or its affiliates are eligible to participate in the 2011 Plan, as are prospective employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors of Quanta who have agreed to serve Quanta in those capacities. An
aggregate of 11,750,000 shares of Quanta common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2011 Plan. Additionally, pursuant to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan, which was adopted on May24, 2007, Quanta may award restricted stock, incentive stock options and
non-qualified stock options to eligible employees, directors, and certain consultants and advisors. An aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Quanta also has a Restricted Stock
Unit Plan the RSU Plan, pursuant to which RSUs may be awarded to certain employees and consultants of Quantas Canadian operations. Equity awards also remain outstanding under a prior plan adopted by Quanta, as well as under plans assumed by Quanta in connection with its acquisition of InfraSource Services, Inc. in 2007. While no
further awards may be made under these plans, the awards outstanding under the plans continue to be governed by their terms. These plans, together with the 2011 Plan, the 2007 Plan and the RSU Plan, are referred to as the Plans. 
The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Quanta. The Compensation Committee
has, subject to applicable regulation and the terms of the Plans, the authority to grant awards under the Plans, to construe and interpret the Plans and to make all other determinations and take any and all actions necessary or advisable for the
administration of the Plans. The Board also delegated to the Equity Grant Committee, a committee of the Board consisting of one or more directors, the authority to grant limited awards to eligible persons who are not executive officers or
non-employee directors. Stock Options 
Awards in the form of stock options are exercisable during the period specified in each stock option agreement and
generally become exercisable in installments pursuant to a vesting schedule designated by the 
110 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Compensation Committee or, if applicable, the Equity Grant Committee. No option will remain exercisable later than 10 years after the date of award or five years in the case of ISOs awarded to
employees owning more than 10% of Quantas voting capital stock. The exercise price for ISOs awarded under the 2011 and 2007 Plans may be no less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of award or 110% in the case
of ISOs awarded to employees owning more than 10% of Quantas voting capital stock. Upon the exercise of stock options, Quanta has historically issued shares of common stock rather than treasury shares or shares purchased on the open market,
although the plan permits any of the three. Quanta did not grant any awards of stock options under any of the Plans during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 or 2010. 
Restricted Stock During the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, Quanta granted 13million, 11million and 10million shares of restricted stock under the Plans with a weighted average
grant date fair value price of $2184, $2138 and $1920 per share, respectively. The grant date fair value for awards of restricted stock is based on the market value of Quanta common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards are subject
to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until vesting, which generally occurs over three years in equal annual installments. During the restriction period, holders are entitled to vote and receive dividends on such
shares. During the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, 09million, 08million and
07million shares of restricted stock vested, respectively, with an approximate fair value at the time of vesting of $223 million, $189 million and $129 million, respectively. 
A summary of the restricted stock activity for the year ended December31, 2012 is as follows shares in thousands:
Shares WeightedAverageGrantDateFair ValuePer share Unvested at January 1, 2012 1,959 2079 Granted 1,250 2184 Vested 934 2098 Forfeited 81 2123 
Unvested at December 31, 2012 2,194 2129 
As of December31, 2012, there was approximately $230 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock granted to both employees and non-employees. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 166 years. 
Restricted Stock Units RSUs granted by Quanta under the Plans are intended to provide plan participants with cash performance incentives that are substantially equivalent to the risks and rewards of equity ownership in Quanta.
RSUs vest over a designated period, typically three years, and are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, primarily termination of service. Upon vesting of RSUs, the holders receive for each vested RSU either ione share of Quanta
common stock, or iian amount in cash equal to the fair market value on the vesting date of one share of 
111 Table of Contents

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Quanta common stock, as specified in the applicable award agreement. Generally, RSUs granted to plan participants residing in the U.S. provide for settlement in shares of common stock, and RSUs
granted to plan participants residing outside the U.S. provide for settlement in cash. As of December31, 2012, there were no RSUs outstanding that provided for settlement in common stock. 
Compensation expense related to RSUs was $20 million, $13 million and $05 million for the years ended
December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Such expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. RSUs that may be settled only in cash are not included in the calculation of earnings per share, and the estimated earned value of such
RSUs is classified as a liability. Quanta paid $17 million, $10 million and $03 million to settle liabilities related to RSUs in the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Liabilities recorded for the estimated earned
value of the RSUs outstanding were $08 million and $05 million at December31, 2012 and 2011.  13.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS: 
Unions Multi-Employer Pension Plans 
Quanta contributes to a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining
agreements with various unions that represent certain of Quantas employees. Quantas multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements usually on an annual basis, and
contributions are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis based on its union employee payrolls. Quanta may also have additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension
plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer pension plan if the employer
withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Quanta recorded a partial withdrawal liability of approximately $326 million related to the withdrawal by certain Quanta subsidiaries
from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan Central States Plan following an amendment to the applicable collective bargaining agreement which eliminated their obligations to contribute to the Central States Plan. See
further information regarding these subsidiaries withdrawal from the Central States Plan in Collective Bargaining Agreements in Note 15. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 the PPA also added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as
endangered, seriously endangered or critical status based on multiple factors including, for example, the plans funded percentage, cash flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum
funding deficiency. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers which may take the
form of a surcharge on benefit contributions and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta contributes or may contribute in the future are in endangered, seriously endangered or critical
status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the future levels of work that require the specific use of union employees covered
by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans. The following table summarizes plan information relating to Quantas participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans, including company contributions for the last three years, the
status under the PPA of the plans and whether the plans are subject to a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan or contribution surcharges. The most recent PPA zone status available in 2012 and 2011 relates to the plans fiscal year-end in
2011 and 2010. Forms 5500 were not yet available for the plan years ending in 2012. The PPA zone status is

based on information that Quanta received from the respective plans, as well as publicly available information on the U.S. Department of Labor website, and is certified by the plans
actuary. Although multiple factors or tests may result in red zone or yellow zone status, plans in the red zone generally are less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone generally are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green
zone generally are at least 80 percent funded. Under the PPA, red zone plans are classified as critical status, yellow zone plans are classified as endangered status and green zone plans are classified as neither
endangered nor critical status. The Subject to Financial Improvement/ Rehabilitation Plan column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan FIP or a rehabilitation plan RP is either pending or has
been implemented. The last column lists the expiration dates of Quantas collective-bargaining agreements to which the plans are subject. Changes in annual contribution levels to these plans will vary because the number of union employees, the
duration of their employment and the plans in which they participate will vary from period to period based on the number and location of projects that Quanta has ongoing at any given time and the need for union resources in connection with those
projects. Total contributions made to these plans increased each year for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 primarily due to an increase in the number and size of projects that required the use of union employees during these
periods. Information has been presented separately for individually significant plans and in the aggregate for all other plans.   PlanNumber PPAZoneStatus  Contributionsin thousands SurchargeImposed

In addition to the contributions made to multi-employer defined benefit pension plans
noted above, Quanta also contributed to multi-employer defined contribution or other benefit plans on behalf of certain union employees. Contributions to union multi-employer defined contribution or other benefit plans by Quanta were approximately
$870 million, $467 million and $358 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Total contributions made to these plans increased each year for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 primarily due to an increase
in the number and size of projects that required the use of union employees during these periods. Quanta 401k Plan
Quanta maintains a 401k plan pursuant to which employees who are not provided retirement benefits
through a collective bargaining agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction. Quanta makes matching cash contributions of 100% of each employees contribution up to 3% of that employees salary and 50% of each
employees contribution between 3% and 6% of such employees salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Contributions to non-union defined contribution plans by Quanta were approximately $110 million, $95 million and $89 million
for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  14.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS: 
Certain of Quantas operating units have entered into related party lease arrangements for
operational facilities, typically with prior owners of certain acquired businesses. These lease agreements generally have terms of up to five years. Related party lease expense for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was
approximately $42 million, $32 million and $23 million, respectively.  15.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: 
Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities 
As described in Note11, Quanta holds investments in certain joint ventures with third parties for the purpose of
providing infrastructure services under certain customer contracts. Losses incurred by these joint ventures are shared equally by the joint venture members. However, each member of the joint venture is jointly and severally liable for all of the
obligations of the joint venture under the contract with the customer and therefore can be liable for full performance of the contract with the customer. In circumstances where Quantas participation in a joint venture qualifies as a general
partnership, the joint venture partners are jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture including obligations owed to the customer or any other person or entity. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would lead
to future claims against it for material amounts in connection with these joint and several liabilities. 
114 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In the joint venture arrangements entered into by Quanta, each joint
venturer indemnifies the other party for any liabilities incurred in excess of the liabilities such other party is obligated to bear under the respective joint venture agreement. It is possible, however, that Quanta could be required to pay or
perform obligations in excess of its share if the other joint venturer failed or refused to pay or perform its share of the obligations. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future claims against it for material amounts that would
not be indemnified. Leases 
Quanta leases certain land, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements, including related party leases
as discussed in Note14. The terms of these agreements vary from lease to lease, including some with renewal options and escalation clauses. The following schedule shows the future minimum lease payments under these leases as of
December31, 2012 in thousands:  Operating Leases Year Ending December 31 2013 24,264 2014 19,689 2015 15,324 2016 11,929 2017 6,767 Thereafter 16,192 
Total minimum lease payments 94,165 
Rent expense related to operating leases was approximately $923 million, $1101 million
and $1000 million for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Quanta has
guaranteed the residual value on certain of its equipment operating leases. Quanta has agreed to pay any difference between this residual value and the fair market value of the underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At
December31, 2012, the maximum guaranteed residual value was approximately $2081 million. Quanta believes that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the
guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance that significant payments will not be required in the future. 
Committed Capital Expenditures Quanta has committed capital for the expansion of its fiber optic network, although Quanta typically does not commit capital to new network expansions until it has a committed licensing arrangement in
place with at least one customer. The amounts of committed capital expenditures are estimates of costs required to build the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures related to building the networks could vary materially from these
estimates. As of December31, 2012, Quanta estimates these committed capital expenditures to be approximately $174 million for the year ended December31, 2013. Also during 2012, Quanta committed capital for the expansion of its vehicle
fleet in order to accommodate manufacturer lead times on certain types of vehicles. As of December31, 2012, production orders for approximately $135 million had been issued with delivery dates expected to occur throughout 2013. Although
Quanta has committed to purchase these vehicles at the time of their delivery, Quanta intends that these orders will be assigned to third party leasing companies and made available to Quanta under certain of its master equipment lease agreements,
which will release Quanta from its capital commitment.

Litigation and Claims 
Quanta is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary
course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive
or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, Quanta records a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Quanta discloses
matters for which management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. Except as otherwise stated below, none of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on Quantas
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In all instances, management has assessed the matter based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, giving due consideration to the nature of
the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought and the probability of success. Managements judgment may prove materially inaccurate, and such judgment is made subject to the known uncertainty of litigation. 
California Fire Litigation SanDiego County.On June18, 2010, PAR Electrical
Contractors, Inc. PAR, a wholly owned subsidiary of Quanta, was named as a third party defendant in four lawsuits in California state court in San Diego County, California, all of which arise out of a wildfire in the San Diego area that started on
October21, 2007, referred to as the Witch Creek fire. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection issued a report concluding that the Witch Creek fire was started when the conductors of a three phase 69kV transmission line, known
as TL 637, owned by San Diego Gas Electric SDGE, touched each other, dropping sparks on dry grass. The Witch Creek fire, together with another wildfire referred to as the Guejito fire that allegedly merged with the Witch Creek
fire, burned a reported 198,000 acres, over 1,500 homes and structures and is alleged to have caused two deaths and numerous personal injuries. Numerous lawsuits have been filed directly against SDGE and its parent company, Sempra, claiming SDGEs power lines caused the fire. The court ordered that the claims be organized into the
four lawsuits mentioned above and grouped the matters by type of plaintiff, namely, insurance subrogation claimants, individual/business claimants, governmental claimants, and a class action matter, for which class certification has since been
denied. PAR is not named as a direct defendant in any of these lawsuits against SDGE or its parent. SDGE has reportedly settled many of the claims. On June18, 2010, SDGE joined PAR to the four lawsuits as a third party
defendant, seeking contractual and equitable indemnification for losses related to the Witch Creek fire. SDGEs claims for indemnity relate to work done by PAR involving the replacement of one pole on TL 637 about four months prior to the
Witch Creek fire. While Quanta did not believe that the work done by PAR was the cause of the contact between the conductors, PAR notified its various insurers of the claims. All but one of the insurers contested coverage. On August5, 2011,
PAR and Quanta filed a lawsuit in California state court against those insurers seeking a determination that coverage exists under the policies. On November5, 2012, PAR, Quanta, PARs insurers and SDGE entered into a mutual settlement agreement pursuant to which SDGE released PAR, Quanta and PARs insurers in exchange for
payment by PARs insurers of a negotiated settlement amount and payment by PAR of $338 million, of which $75 million had been previously expensed, and $263 million was funded by an insurer as part of the previously recorded $350 million
liability and corresponding insurance recovery receivable associated with a reimbursement-type policy. In the settlement, one other insurer reserved its rights to contest coverage and seek reimbursement from PAR of the $250 million this insurer
paid to SDGE as part of the settlement. That insurer subsequently agreed not to contest coverage or seek reimbursement from PAR, and pursuant to mutual releases executed by the parties, the coverage lawsuit was dismissed as to all parties in
January 2013.

California Fire Claim Amador County.In October
2004, a wildfire in Amador County, California, burned 16,800 acres. The United States Forest Service alleged that the fire originated as a result of the activities of a Quanta subsidiary crew performing vegetation management under a contract with
Pacific Gas Electric Co. PGE. In November 2007, the United States Department of Agriculture USDA sent a written demand to the Quanta subsidiary for payment of fire suppression costs of approximately $85 million. Quanta recorded
a liability and corresponding insurance recovery receivable of approximately $85 million associated with this matter based on the written demand received from the USDA. 
The USDA informally communicated that it also intends to seek past and future restoration and other damages of
approximately $513 million, as well as other unspecified damages. PGE tendered defense and indemnification for the matter to Quanta in 2010. On August3, 2012, the USDA filed suit in the United States District Court, Eastern District of
California, against Quanta, its subsidiary and PGE, seeking unspecified damages for fire suppression costs, rehabilitation and restoration expenses, and loss of timber, habitat and environmental values, among other things, including recovery of
fees and expenses. Quanta and its subsidiary are prepared to vigorously defend against any liability and damage allegations. Quanta notified its insurers, and two insurers are participating under a reservation of rights. Two other insurers are also participating but have not stated a position regarding coverage. In January
2013, Quanta and its subsidiary filed a lawsuit in Amador County seeking a declaration that the insurers have a duty at their respective levels to pay any damages resulting from the USDA claims. The parties attended mediation in January 2013. While
a resolution was not reached at the mediation, the parties have subsequently continued negotiating through the mediator. As a result of these continued negotiations, a settlement-in-principle has been reached with the USDA, subject to approval by
the United States Department of Justice, for an amount within Quantas available insurance coverage. However, should the terms of the settlement-in-principle fail to be agreed in writing by the parties and approved by the Department of Justice,
these claims could result in a significant uninsured loss and a material adverse effect on Quantas consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Arbitration. On October1, 2010, Mears Group, Inc. Mears, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Quanta, filed a request for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce ICC in London against the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago NGC. The request for arbitration arises out of a contract between
Mears and NGC for horizontal directional drilling HDD services in connection with a shore approach of a natural gas pipeline. During pullback of the pipeline, a component on the drill rig operated by Mears failed, and the pipeline was lodged
downhole. Subsequent efforts to salvage the pipeline by NGC, Mears, and other parties failed to dislodge the pipeline. NGC subsequently hired a separate HDD contractor to complete reworks. 
Mears alleges breach of contract, among other things, and seeks recovery for works performed, standby costs,
demobilization costs, and other expenses, totaling approximately $165 million, including taxes, and additionally seeks recovery of pre-judgment interest and attorneys fees and expenses. Mears contends in the arbitration that NGC breached the
contract between the parties by providing a pipeline with insufficient buoyancy, weighing significantly more than the weight specified in the contract. In addition, Mears argues that NGC failed to provide a contractually required builders all-risk
insurance policy naming Mears as an additional insured, which would have covered losses associated with a pullback failure. Moreover, Mears asserts that NGC agreed to indemnify Mears for losses to NGCs equipment for events occurring during the
project, and that any recovery by NGC is therefore barred. NGC counterclaimed in the arbitration, asserting
that Mears breached the contract and performed negligently by failing to provide a drilling component capable of withstanding loads during pullback and providing a hole of insufficient cleanliness such that debris and other materials contributed to
excess forces

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
experienced during Mears pullback of the pipeline. NGC seeks recovery for the costs of the salvage operations, the cost of the reworks, as well as other costs, totaling approximately $795
million, and additionally seeks recovery of pre-judgment interest and attorneys fees and expenses. The
arbitration hearings were completed during the third quarter of 2012, but no decision has been reached. Mears believes that it provided a hole of sufficient cleanliness, that its drilling components were fit for the purposes intended under the
contract, and that pullback would not have failed had NGC provided a pipeline conforming to contractual weight specifications. Thus, Mears continues to vigorously pursue its claims and defend NGCs counterclaims, and Mears believes it will
prevail in the arbitration. Mears also notified its insurers of the counterclaims, and although coverage was denied, Mears is continuing to pursue its insurers for coverage. Due to the nature of these claims, however, an adverse result in these
proceedings could result in a significant uninsured loss that could have a material adverse effect on Quantas consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk Quanta is subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to its cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, including amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and
estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of Quantas cash investments are managed by what it believes to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with Quantas investment
policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what Quanta believes to be high quality investments, which consist primarily of interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and investment
grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less. Although Quanta does not currently believe the principal amount of these investments is subject to any material risk of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the
interest income Quanta receives from these investments. In addition, Quanta grants credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to its customers, which include electric power, natural gas and oil pipeline companies, governmental
entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United States and Canada. Consequently, Quanta is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and
economic factors throughout the United States and Canada, which may be heightened as a result of uncertain economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. However, Quanta generally has certain statutory lien rights with
respect to services provided. Historically, some of Quantas customers have experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties in the future. These difficulties expose Quanta to increased risk
related to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for services Quanta has performed. For each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, one customer
accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated revenues. The services provided to these customers relate primarily to Quantas Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment in 2011 and its Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services
segment in 2010. As of December31, 2012, two customers accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of consolidated billed and accrued accounts receivable. Substantially all of the balance for the customer with 11% of consolidated billed and
accrued accounts receivable relates to one contract and is comprised primarily of certain contract change orders for which the customer acceptance process is ongoing. Additionally, as of December 31, 2011, one customer accounted for approximately
10% of consolidated billed and accrued accounts receivable. The services provided to these customers, with billed and accrued accounts receivable balances greater than 10% of the consolidated balance, relate primarily to Quantas Electric Power
Infrastructure Services segment. No other customers represented 10% or more of revenues for the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 or of billed and unbilled accounts receivable as of December31, 2012 and 2011.

Self-Insurance 
Quanta is insured for employers liability, general liability, auto liability and workers compensation claims.
Since August1, 2009, all policy deductible levels are $50 million per occurrence, other than employers liability, which is subject to a deductible of $10 million. Quanta also has employee health care benefit plans for most employees
not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year. Losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon Quantas estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with
assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of Quantas liability in proportion to
other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. As of December31, 2012 and 2011, the gross amount accrued for insurance
claims totaled $1608 million and $2012 million, with $1202 million and $1554 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related insurance recoveries/receivables as of December31, 2012 and 2011 were
$222 million and $631 million, of which $23 million and $98 million are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $199 million and $533 million are included in other assets, net. These balance sheet amounts include liabilities
and recoveries/receivables related to the insurance claims retained by Quanta associated with the sale of its telecommunication operating units on December3, 2012. 
Quanta renews its insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may
change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel Quantas coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or Quanta may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of insurance if it believes that the cost to
obtain such coverage exceeds the additional benefits obtained. In any such event, Quantas overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
Letters of Credit Certain of Quantas vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on its behalf, such as to beneficiaries under its self-funded insurance programs. In
addition, from time to time, certain customers require Quanta to post letters of credit to ensure payment to its subcontractors and vendors and to guarantee performance under its contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or
similar financial institution, typically pursuant to Quantas credit facility. Each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that Quanta has failed to perform
specified actions. If this were to occur, Quanta would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, Quanta may also be required to record a charge to earnings for the
reimbursement. Quanta does not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future. As of December31, 2012, Quanta had $1832 million in letters of credit outstanding under its credit facility primarily to secure obligations under its casualty insurance program. These are
irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2013. Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of these letters of credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods. 
Performance Bonds and Parent Guarantees 
In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide performance bonds in connection with its contractual commitments.
Quanta has indemnified its sureties for any expenses paid out under these performance bonds. As 
119 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
of December31, 2012, the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was approximately $20 billion, and the estimated cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately $6434
million. Quanta, from time to time, guarantees the obligations of its wholly owned subsidiaries, including
obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. Quanta is not aware of any material obligations for performance or payment
asserted against it under any of these guarantees. Employment Agreements 
Quanta has various employment agreements with certain executives and other employees, which provide for compensation and
certain other benefits and for severance payments under certain circumstances. Certain employment agreements also contain clauses that become effective upon a change of control of Quanta. Quanta may be obligated to pay certain amounts to employees
upon the occurrence of any of the defined events in the various employment agreements. Collective Bargaining Agreements
Several of Quantas operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements with
unions that represent certain of their employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. The agreements require the
operating units to pay specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts. Quantas multiemployer pension plan contribution rates
generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements usually on an annual basis, and contributions are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis based on its union employee payrolls, which cannot be determined for future
periods because the location and number of union employees that Quanta employs at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects Quanta has ongoing at any time and the need for union resources in connection
with those projects. The PPA also added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan
years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical status based on multiple factors including, for example, the plans funded percentage,
cash flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which
may require additional contributions from employers which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta contributes or may contribute in the future are in
endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated due to uncertainty of the
future levels of work that require the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans. 
Quanta may be subject to additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in multi-employer defined
benefit pension plans. For example, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer
pension plan if the employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. These liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not merely the
benefits payable to a contributing employers own retirees. As a result, participating employers may bear a higher proportion of liability for unfunded vested 
120 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
benefits if other participating employers cease to contribute or withdraw, with the reallocation of liability being more acute in cases when a withdrawn employer is insolvent or otherwise fails
to pay its withdrawal liability. Other than as described below, Quanta is not aware of any material amounts of withdrawal liability that have been incurred as a result of a withdrawal by any of Quantas operating units from any multi-employer
defined benefit pension plans. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Quanta recorded a partial withdrawal liability
of approximately $326 million related to the withdrawal by certain Quanta subsidiaries from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan the Central States Plan. The partial withdrawal liability recognized by Quanta was based on
estimates received from the Central States Plan during 2011 for a complete withdrawal by all Quanta companies participating in the Central States Plan. The withdrawal followed an amendment to a collective bargaining agreement with the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters that eliminated obligations to contribute to the Central States Plan, which is in critical status and is significantly underfunded as to its vested benefit obligations. The amendment was negotiated by the Pipe Line
Contractors Association PLCA on behalf of its members, which include the Quanta subsidiaries that withdrew from the Central States Plan. Quanta believed that withdrawing from the Central States Plan in the fourth quarter of 2011 was advantageous
because it limited Quantas exposure to increased liabilities from a future withdrawal if the underfunded status of the Central States Plan deteriorates further. Quanta and other PLCA members now contribute to a different multi-employer pension
plan on behalf of Teamsters employees. The Central States Plan has asserted that the withdrawal of the PLCA
members was not effective in 2011, although Quanta believes that a legally effective withdrawal occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, the Central States Plan provided Quanta with an estimate of the potential
withdrawal liability, indicating that the withdrawal liability is approximately $328 million based on a partial withdrawal in the fourth quarter of 2011, approximately $397 million based on a partial withdrawal in the first quarter of 2012, or
approximately $401 million based on a complete withdrawal in 2012. Quanta continues to dispute the assertions of the Central States Plan regarding the effective date of the partial withdrawal. Once an assessment is received, Quanta may seek to
challenge and further negotiate the amount of the assessment. As a result, the final partial withdrawal liability cannot yet be determined with certainty and could be materially higher or lower than the $326 million Quanta recognized in the fourth
quarter of 2011. Certain other Quanta subsidiaries continued to participate in the Central States Plan
through the end of 2012. The consequences of withdrawal of these subsidiaries from the plan will depend on various factors, including negotiation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which the subsidiaries participate and
whether exemptions from withdrawal liability applicable to construction industry employers will be available. Given the unknown nature of some of these factors, the amount or timing of any liability upon withdrawal of the subsidiaries remaining in
the Central States Plan is uncertain. However, Quanta currently does not expect the incremental liability upon withdrawal of the subsidiaries remaining in the Central States Plan to be material. 
Indemnities Quanta generally indemnifies its customers for the services it provides under its contracts, as well as other specified liabilities, which may subject Quanta to indemnity claims and liabilities and
related litigation. Quanta has also indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with Quantas previous acquisition or disposition of certain companies. The indemnities
under acquisition or disposition agreements are usually contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December31, 2012, except as otherwise set forth above in Litigation and Claims, Quanta
does not believe any material liabilities for asserted claims exist against it in connection with any of these indemnity obligations.

SEGMENT INFORMATION: 
Quanta presents its operations under three reportable segments: 1Electric Power Infrastructure
Services, 2Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services and 3Fiber Optic Licensing and Other. This structure is generally based on the broad end-user markets for Quantas services. See Note 1 for additional information
regarding Quantas reportable segments. Quantas segment results are derived from the types of
services provided across its operating units in each of the end user markets described above. Quantas entrepreneurial business model allows each of its operating units to serve the same or similar customers and to provide a range of services
across end user markets. Quantas operating units are organized into one of three internal divisions, namely, the electric power division, natural gas and pipeline division and fiber optic division. These internal divisions are closely aligned
with the reportable segments described above based on their operating units predominant type of work. 
Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is gathered from each operating
unit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of Quantas market strategies. These classifications of Quantas operating unit revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the
part of management. Quantas operating units may perform joint infrastructure service projects for customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple types of network services under a single customer contract or provide service across
industries, for example, joint trenching projects to install distribution lines for electric power and natural gas customers. In addition, Quantas integrated operations and common administrative support at each of its operating units require that certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such
as facility costs, indirect operating expenses, including depreciation, and general and administrative costs, to determine operating segment profitability. Corporate costs, such as payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility costs,
professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization related to certain intangible assets are not allocated.

Separate measures of Quantas assets and cash flows by reportable
segment, including capital expenditures, are not produced or utilized by management to evaluate segment performance. Quantas fixed assets, which are held at the operating unit level, include operating machinery, equipment and vehicles, as well
as office equipment, buildings and leasehold improvements, are used on an interchangeable basis across its reportable segments. As such, for reporting purposes, total depreciation expense is allocated each quarter among Quantas reportable
segments based on the ratio of each reportable segments revenue contribution to consolidated revenues. Foreign
Operations During 2012, 2011, and 2010, Quanta derived $8615 million, $5350 million and $2561
million, respectively, of its revenues from foreign operations. Of Quantas foreign revenues, approximately 96%, 97% and 88% was earned in Canada during the years ended December31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, Quanta
held property and equipment of $1519 million and $1148 million in foreign countries, primarily Canada, as of December31, 2012 and 2011. The increase in foreign revenues and assets is primarily due to the timing of the acquisitions of Valard,
McGregor Construction 2000 Ltd. and certain of its affiliated entities and Coe Drilling Pty. Ltd.  17.
