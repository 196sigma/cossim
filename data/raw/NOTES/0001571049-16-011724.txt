ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Aware, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Aware, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements
of income and comprehensive income, stockholders equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2015 and the financial statement schedule of Aware, Inc. listed in a. We also have audited the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. The Companys management
is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an
opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that a pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; b provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and c provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. s/ RSM US LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.NATURE OF BUSINESS We are a leading provider
of software and services to the biometrics industry. Our software products are used in government and commercial biometrics systems,
which are capable of determining or verifying an individuals identity. We also offer engineering services related to software
customization, integration, and installation, as well as complete systems development. We sell our biometrics software products
and services globally through systems integrators, OEMs, and directly to end user customers 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation
- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aware, Inc. and its subsidiary the Company.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates 
The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. The most significant estimates included in the financial statements pertain to revenue recognition,
reserves for doubtful accounts, useful lives of fixed assets, valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets, and accrued
liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value Measurements
- The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Codification defines fair value, and establishes a fair
value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to the unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 measurements and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the FASB Codification
are: i Level 1 valuations that are based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date; ii Level 2 valuations that are based on
quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly;
and iii Level 3 valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. Cash and cash equivalents,
which primarily include money market mutual funds, were $512 million and $440 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31,
2014, respectively. We classified our cash equivalents of $430 million and $343 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively,
within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. Our investments, which consist
of high yield corporate debt securities, are also classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued
using quoted market prices. Debt securities with maturities greater than one year are classified as long term assets. We categorize
our investments as available-for-sale securities, and carry them at fair value in our financial statements. We had $09 million
and $14 million of available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our
assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and whose carrying values approximate their respective fair values
include the following in thousands

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market funds and demand deposits, are stated at fair
value. All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.
Our cash balances exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. The Company does not believe it is exposed to significant
credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents. Investments
- At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we categorized all investment securities as available-for-sale, since we may liquidate these
investments currently. In calculating realized gains and losses, cost is determined using specific identification. Unrealized
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of stockholders
equity called Accumulated Comprehensive Income. Realized gains on investments
were $12,000 and $23,000 in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013, respectively. Realized losses on investments were $59,000
in the year ended December 31, 2014. Unrealized losses on investments
were $53,000 and $156,000 in the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2013. Unrealized gains on investments were $162,000 in the
year ended December 31, 2014. The amortized cost of our
corporate debt securities was $10 million at December 31, 2015. Corporate debt securities comprising investments mature in 2017
and 2018. Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts Accounts are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts as they are deemed uncollectible based on
a periodic review of the accounts. Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO
method. We evaluate all inventories for net realizable value on a quarterly basis, and record provisions for excess and obsolete
inventory when required. We had no inventory or reserve for excess and obsolete inventory as of December 31, 2015. Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement or sale, the costs of the assets
disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss on disposal
is included in the determination of income or loss. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful lives
of assets used by us are   Building

AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate.
Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets over their
estimated economic life to the related carrying value of those assets to determine if the assets are impaired. If an impairment
is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. The cash flow estimates used to identify the potential impairment
reflect our best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time. We believe that no significant impairment
of our long-lived assets has occurred as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable,
collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. Persuasive
evidence of an arrangement: We use contracts signed by both the customer and us or written purchase orders issued by the customer
as evidence of an arrangement. Product
delivery: We deem delivery to have occurred: i upon shipment when products are shipped FOB shipping point, or ii upon
delivery at a customers location when products are shipped FOB destination, or iii when software is delivered electronically.
If customer acceptance provisions apply, revenue is not recognized until delivery has occurred and we have received such acceptance.
If we are required to provide installation services, revenue is not recognized until installation is complete. Fixed
or determinable fee: We consider fees to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and the
payment terms are within normal established practices. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize the revenue as amounts
become due and payable. Collection
is deemed probable: We conduct a credit review for significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the
credit-worthiness of the customer. Collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will pay amounts under the arrangement
as payments become due. We categorize revenue as software
licenses, software maintenance, services, hardware, or royalties. In addition to the general revenue recognition policies described
above, specific revenue recognition policies apply to each category of revenue. Software licenses
Software licenses consist
of revenue from the sale of software licenses for biometrics and imaging applications. Our software licenses typically provide
customers with the right to use our software in perpetuity. We recognize revenue from software licenses upon delivery when licenses
are sold in single element arrangements, because we have no post-delivery obligations, including contractual or implied Post Contract
Support PCS. Software maintenance
Software maintenance consists
of revenue from the sale of software maintenance contracts for biometrics and imaging software. Software maintenance contracts
entitle customers to receive software support and software updates, if and when they become available, during the term of the
maintenance contract. We recognize software maintenance revenue ratably over the related contract period. Services
Service revenue consists of
fees from biometrics customers for software engineering services we provide to them. We recognize services revenue as services
are delivered when services are sold in single element arrangements. Hardware
Hardware revenue consists
of sales of biometrics equipment to a single U.S. government customer. We recognize hardware revenue upon delivery and acceptance
of the equipment by the customer.   47
AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Royalties
Royalties consist primarily
of royalty payments we receive under DSL silicon contracts with two customers that incorporate our silicon intellectual property
IP in their DSL chipsets. We sold the assets of our DSL IP business in 2009, but we continue to receive royalty
payments from these customers. Royalties are reported in continuing operations in accordance with ASC 205, Reporting Discontinued
Operations, because we have continuing ongoing cash flows from this business. Since we cannot reasonably
estimate royalty revenue, such revenue is recognized in the quarter in which a final report is received from a customer. Royalty
reports are typically received in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which sales of royalty-bearing products occur. Multiple element arrangements
with software and software related elements
In addition to selling software
licenses, software maintenance and software services in single element arrangements, we also sell these three products as part
of multiple element arrangements. We apply the provisions of ASC 985-605, Software Revenue Recognition, to these arrangements
because all the elements are software or software related. The various combinations of multiple element arrangements and our revenue
recognition for each are described as follows Software
licenses and software maintenance. When software licenses and software maintenance
contracts are sold together, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, provided
we have vendor specific objective evidence VSOE for the fair value of
the maintenance contract fee, and we recognize the fair value of maintenance contract
revenue ratably over the related contract period. Under ASC 985-605, the residual method
is the appropriate manner in which to allocate arrangement consideration to the license
when VSOE exists for all undelivered elements e.g., PCS, but not for the delivered
element e.g., the license. When we do not have VSOE for PCS, we recognize the entire
arrangement fee over the contractual PCS period. As a result of not having VSOE for PCS
in one arrangement in 2015, we deferred $36 million of license revenue at December 31,
2015 under this policy. Software
licenses and services. When software licenses and software engineering services are
sold together, the total fee is generally recognized by applying contract accounting.
We have adopted the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting, and we generally
use an input method i.e., labor hours to determine our completion percentage. The software
license portion of the arrangement is classified as software license revenue and the
engineering services portion is classified as services revenue in our consolidated statements
of income and comprehensive income. Software
licenses, software maintenance and services. When we sell software licenses, software
maintenance and software services together, revenue is recognized as follows: i software
maintenance revenue is separated from the other two elements and is recognized ratably
over the related software maintenance contract period; provided we have VSOE for the
fair value of the maintenance element; and ii the total fee from the software license
and engineering service elements is recognized by applying the contract accounting method
described in the previous paragraph. Multiple element arrangement
with hardware and software elements
We also have a multiple element
arrangement with one customer that involves the delivery of hardware, software maintenance, and software services. We determined
that these elements qualified as separate units of accounting under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, because they have value to the
customer on a standalone basis. We recognize revenue from this arrangement as follows: i hardware revenue is recognized upon
delivery and acceptance of the equipment by the customer; ii maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the related contract
period; and iii service revenue is recognized as services are delivered. Income Taxes
We compute deferred income taxes based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We establish a valuation
allowance to offset temporary deductible differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits when it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.   48
AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We recognize the tax benefit
from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by
the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the tax position. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is based
on factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in the tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to
be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, and changes in facts or circumstances related to
a tax position. Any changes to these estimates, based on the actual results obtained and/or a change in assumptions, could impact
our tax provision in future periods. Interest and penalty charges, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits would be classified
as a provision for income tax in the statement of income. Capitalization of Software
Costs We capitalize certain internally developed software development costs after technological feasibility of
the product has been established. No software costs were capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, because
such costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, but prior to commercial availability, were immaterial. Research and Development
Costs Costs incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred. Concentration of Credit
Risk At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents, in excess of federally insured deposit limits
of approximately $510 million and $437 million, respectively. Concentration of credit risk
with respect to net accounts receivable consisted of amounts owed by the following customers that comprised more than 10% of net
accounts receivable at December 31

respectively, at December 31, 2014. Stock-Based Compensation
We grant stock and stock options to our employees and directors. We measure stock-based compensation cost at the
grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period of the award. For stock awards, we determine
the fair value of the award by using the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant; provided the number of shares in
the grant is fixed on the grant date. For stock options, we use
the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of the award. This valuation model takes into account the
exercise price of the award, as well as a variety of significant assumptions. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value
of stock options include the expected term, the expected volatility of our stock over the expected term, the risk-free interest
rate over the expected term, and our expected annual dividend yield. Computation of Earnings
per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would have been outstanding if
dilutive potential common shares had been issued. For the purposes of this calculation, stock options are considered common stock
equivalents in periods in which they have a dilutive effect. Stock options that are antidilutive are excluded from the calculation. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.   49
AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The carrying amount of investments
is based on the fair value of the individual securities in our investment portfolio. Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were not material for 2015, 2014, and 2013. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606. The ASU is the result
of a joint project by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board IASB to clarify the principles
for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS
that would: remove inconsistencies and weaknesses, provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improve comparability
of revenue recognition practices across entities, jurisdictions, industries, and capital markets, improve disclosure requirements
and resulting financial statements, and simplify the presentation of financial statements. The core principle of the new guidance
is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. On July 9, 2015, the FASB voted
to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year, but to permit entities to choose to adopt the standard as
of the original effective date. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. In November 2015, the FASB
issued Accounting Standard Update ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which
requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position
to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The standard is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company did not early adopt this
standard. The effect of early adoption would not have been material as it would have only resulted in a $184,000 reclass of short
term deferred tax assets to long term deferred tax assets on our December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheets. With the exception of the two
standards above, there have been no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that are of significance or potential significance
to us that we have not adopted as of December 31, 2015. Reclassifications - Certain
prior period amounts on our consolidated balance sheets were reclassified to be consistent with the current period presentation.
Specifically, $2,000 of inventory at December 31, 2014 was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and certain
accrued expense line items at December 31, 2014 were condensed into one accrued expenses line item. Segments 
We organize ourselves into a single segment reporting to the chief operating decision makers. We have sales outside of the
United States, which are described in Note 9. All long-lived assets are maintained in the United States. 3.PATENT RELATED INCOME The composition of
patent related income in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was as follows Year ended December 31,
2015. We had a $43,000 gain on the sale of patent assets in 2015, which is described below We sold a portion of our patent
portfolio pertaining to home networking technology to an unrelated third party for $50,000. The proceeds from the sale were reduced
by $7,000 of transaction costs, which consisted primarily of fees from the law firm that assisted us in the sale. We recorded
a gain of $43,000 on the sale.   50
AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Year ended December 31, 2014.
We had a $21 million gain on the sale of patent assets in 2014, which is described below We sold a portion of our patent
portfolio pertaining to DSL diagnostic technology to an unrelated third party for $26 million. The proceeds from the sale were
reduced by $05 million of transaction costs, which consisted primarily of fees from the law firm that assisted us in the sale.
We recorded a gain of $21 million on the sale. The DSL diagnostic technology in
the patents we sold in 2014 was related to our DSL Service Assurance business that we shut down in 2012 and 2013 and reported
in discontinued operations in those periods. We do not consider our patent related activities to be a component of the operating
business from which the underlying technology was derived, but rather as a component of corporate general and administrative expenses.
Accordingly the gain on the sale of these patents was reported in income from continuing operations. The gains on the sale of patents
was included in income from continuing operations pursuant to ASC 360-10, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and Rule
5-03 of Regulation S-X. Year ended December 31, 2013.
We had $08 million of income from a patent arrangement in 2013, which is described below We entered into an arrangement
with an unaffiliated third party in 2010 under which we assigned certain patents in return for royalties on proceeds from patent
monetization efforts by the third party. Such third party has engaged in various patent monetization activities, including enforcement,
litigation and licensing. The party reported and we recorded $08 million of income from this arrangement in the year ended December
31, 2013. We continue to have a contractual
relationship with this third party. However, we are unable to predict how much more income we might receive from this arrangement,
if any, because The
claims in one of the patents we assigned were rejected by the United States Patent Office
USPTO in May 2013. The USPTOs Patent Trial Appeal Board
PTAB affirmed the USPTO decision in June 2014. The PTAB decision was
appealed to the Federal Circuit. In December 2014, the Federal Circuit remanded the appeal
back to the PTAB for further consideration. In August 2015, the PTAB remanded the case
back to the USPTO patent examiner of record for further review. In November 2015, the
USPTO confirmed the validity of the claims in the patent. Even
though the USPTO has confirmed the validity of the claims in the patent, we do not know
whether any patent monetization efforts by the third party will be successful. 4.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Our board of directors approved
the shutdown of our DSL service assurance software product line in 2013. This product line was previously a component of our DSL
Service Assurance Segment. Results from the DSL Service Assurance Segment have been reported as discontinued operations because
we no longer have any significant continuing involvement with, or cash flows from, this segment. Loss from the discontinued DSL
Service Assurance Segment was in thousands

costs related to the software product line of approximately $29 million. Such costs comprise: i $37 million of payments to
customers to terminate contracts, which were offset by $12 million of deferred revenue obligations that were relieved as a result
of such contract terminations; ii $03 million of severance and employee-related costs; and iii $48,000 of asset write-offs.
All such costs were incurred and included in loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. All DSL service
assurance software product line exit costs were paid in 2013, with the exception of $01 million of severance costs, which were
paid in early January 2014. There were no assets or liabilities
remaining on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 related to the DSL Service Assurance Segment. 5.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment consisted

34 We recorded a benefit from income
taxes of $05 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, all of which was included in continuing operations. The benefit from
income taxes was the result of a $19 million tax benefit from the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions, which was
partially offset by $14 million of income taxes on pre-tax income based on the U.S. statutory rate of 34%, increased by state
income taxes, and reduced by research tax credits and permanent adjustments. As previously reported, the Internal
Revenue Service IRS commenced an examination of our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2012 in September
2014. In July 2015, the IRS notified us that it had completed its examination and that it had no changes to our reported tax.
As a result of the completion of the IRS examination, we determined that the $19 million reserve for uncertain tax positions
we had established on federal research and development credits in 2012 was no longer required. We reversed the reserve in 2015. Total income tax expense for the
year ended December 31, 2014 was $27 million, all of which was included in continuing operations. Income tax expense for 2014
was based on the U.S. statutory rate of 34%, increased by state income taxes, and reduced by Federal research tax credits and
permanent adjustments. Total income tax expense for the
year ended December 31, 2013 was $12 million, including $19 million of tax expense that was recorded in continuing operations
less a tax benefit of $07 million that was recorded in discontinued operations. Income tax expense for 2013 was based on the
U.S. statutory rate of 34%, increased by state income taxes, and reduced by Federal research tax credits and permanent adjustments.
Tax expense in 2013 also reflects two items related to 2012, including: i a tax benefit of $01 million related to the 2012 research
tax credit. This credit was extended retroactively back to January 1, 2012, by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which
was enacted on January 2, 2013; and ii a tax benefit of $01 million related to a reduction in the estimate of the 2012 tax expense
recorded in our 2012 financial statements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014,
we had deferred tax assets for which we had recorded no valuation allowance. The principal components of deferred tax assets were

addition to deferred tax assets carried on our balance sheet, we also had net federal and state research and development credit
carryforwards available at December 31, 2015 of $55 million and $01 million. These credits were not recorded as tax assets as
they relate to excess stock compensation deductions that may not be recorded as tax assets under generally accepted accounting
principles until the amounts have been utilized to reduce our tax liability. To the extent that these assets are used to reduce
future taxes, the benefit will be recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded tax
benefits of $06 million, $12 million, and $01 million, respectively, to equity related to the use of these tax credits to reduce
our tax liability. Our policy is to recognize interest
and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2015, we had no accrued interest or
penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The tax years from 2013 through
2015 are subject to examination by the IRS and the tax years 2000 through 2015 are subject to examination by state tax authorities. 7.EQUITY AND STOCK COMPENSATION
PLANS Fixed Stock Option Plan
We have one active fixed stock option plan which is our 2001 Nonqualified Stock Plan 2001 Plan. We are
authorized to grant nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards to our employees and directors for
up to 8,000,000 shares of common stock under this plan. As of December 31, 2015, there were 4,966,715 shares available for grant
under the 2001 Plan. Options are granted at exercise
prices as determined by the Board of Directors and have terms ranging from four to a maximum of ten years. Options generally vest
over three to five years. The following table presents stock-based

AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Stock Option Grants. We
did not grant any stock options in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. When we grant stock options we estimate the
fair value of those stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes valuation model takes into account
the exercise price of the award, as well as a variety of significant assumptions. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value
of stock options include the expected term, the expected volatility of our stock over the expected term, the risk-free interest
rate over the expected term, and our expected annual dividend yield. We do not estimate our forfeiture rates as the actual forfeiture
rate is known at the end of each reporting period due to the timing of our stock option vesting. Unrestricted Stock Grants.
Our 2001 Plan permits us to grant shares of unrestricted stock to our directors, officers, and employees. Stock-based compensation
expense for stock grants is determined based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant; provided the number of
shares in the grant is fixed on the grant date. We granted 152,000, 152,000, and 130,000 shares of unrestricted stock during the
years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The accounting treatment of unrestricted
stock awards in 2015, 2014 and 2013 is described below Year ended December 31, 2015.
In March 2015, we granted 152,000 shares of unrestricted stock to directors, officers and employees. The shares were issued
in two equal installments shortly after June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015. We expensed $682,000 of stock-based compensation
expense related to this grant in the year ended December 31, 2015. There was no unamortized stock-based compensation charge associated
with this stock grant as of December 31, 2015. We issued shares of common stock
related to the March 2015 grant as follows: i 58,862 net shares of common stock were issued in early July 2015 after employees
surrendered 17,138 shares for which we paid $69,000 of withholding taxes on their behalf; and ii 57,151 shares of common stock
were issued in early January 2016 after employees surrendered 18,849 shares for which we paid $61,000 of withholding taxes on
their behalf. Year ended December 31, 2014.
In March 2014, we granted 152,000 shares of unrestricted stock to directors, officers and employees. The shares were issued
in two equal installments shortly after June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014. We expensed $876,000 of stock-based compensation
expense related to this grant in the year ended December 31, 2014. There was no unamortized stock-based compensation charge associated
with this stock grant as of December 31, 2014. We issued shares of common stock
related to the March 2014 grant as follows: i 58,769 net shares of common stock were issued in early July 2014 after employees
surrendered 17,231 shares for which we paid $113,000 of withholding taxes on their behalf; and ii 56,804 shares of common stock
were issued in early January 2015 after employees surrendered 19,196 shares for which we paid $87,000 of withholding taxes on

expense related to this grant in the year ended December 31, 2013. There was no unamortized stock-based compensation charge associated
with this stock grant as of December 31, 2013. We issued shares of common stock

no unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options as there were no non-vested stock options. We issue common stock from previously
authorized but unissued shares to satisfy option exercises and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
- In June 1996, we adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP Plan under which eligible employees
could purchase common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning
or end of each six-month offering period. On November 29, 2005 we amended the ESPP Plan to provide that eligible employees may
purchase common stock at a price equal to 95% of the fair market value of the common stock as of the end of each six-month offering
period. There is no stock-based compensation expense related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan because it is not considered
a compensatory plan. The plan does not have a look-back feature, and has a minimal discount of 5% of the fair market value of
the common stock as of the end of each six-month offering period. Participation in the ESPP Plan is limited to 6% of an employees
compensation, may be terminated at   56

course of business that require us: i to perform under the terms of the contracts, ii to protect the confidentiality of our
customers intellectual property, and iii to indemnify customers, including indemnification against third party claims
alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. We also have agreements with each of our directors and executive officers
to indemnify such directors or executive officers, to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred
in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director
or officer of the Company. Given the nature of the above obligations
and agreements, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount that we could be required to pay.
Historically, we have not made any significant payments on the above guarantees and indemnifications and no amount has been accrued
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these guarantees and indemnifications. 9.BUSINESS
