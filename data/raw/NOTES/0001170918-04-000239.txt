The Board of Directors
Tag-It Pacific, Inc.
Los Angeles, California
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tag-It
Pacific, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and convertible
redeemable preferred stock and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended  December 31, 2003.  These  financial  statements  are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tag-It
Pacific, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.                           /s/ BDO Seidman, LLP

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Tag-It Pacific, Inc. the Company is the parent holding company of
Tag-It, Inc., a California corporation, Tag-It Pacific HK Ltd., a BVI
corporation, Tag-It de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., A.G.S. Stationery, Inc., a
California corporation and Pacific Trim & Belt, Inc., a California corporation
collectively, the Subsidiaries, all of which were consolidated under a
parent limited liability company on October 17, 1997 and became wholly-owned
subsidiaries of the Company immediately prior to the effective date of the
Company initial public offering in January 1998. Immediately prior to the
initial public offering, the outstanding membership units of Tag-It Pacific LLC
were converted to 2,470,001 shares of Common Stock of the Company. In November
1998, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Trim, SA de CV
located in Tlaxcala, Mexico now included in Subsidiaries. All the activities
of this company were merged into Tag-It de Mexico, SA de CV, in 1999. In January
2000, the Company formed Tag-It Pacific Limited, a Hong Kong corporation, in
April 2000,  the Company formed Talon  International,  Inc., a Delaware
corporation. All newly formed corporations are 100% wholly-owned Subsidiaries of
Tag-It Pacific, Inc. Pacific Trim & Belt, Inc. was dissolved during 2000.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are
translated at rates of exchange in effect at the close of the period. Revenues
and expenses are translated at the weighted average of exchange rates in effect
during the year. The resulting translation gains and losses are deferred and are
shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity and transaction gains and
losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the period
incurred.  During 2003, 2002 and 2001, foreign currency translation and
transaction gains and losses were not material.
NATURE OF BUSINESS
The Company specializes in the distribution of a full range of trim
items to manufacturers of fashion apparel, specialty retailers and mass
merchandisers. The Company acts as a full service outsourced trim management
department for manufacturers of fashion apparel such as Abercrombie & Fitch,
Tarrant Apparel Group, Kentucky Apparel and Azteca Production International. The
Company also serves as a specified supplier of trim items to specific brands,
brand licensees and retailers, including Abercrombie & Fitch, Express, Levi
Strauss & Co., The Limited, Lerner and Miller Outpost, among others. In
addition, the Company distributes zippers under the TALON brand name to
manufacturers for apparel brands and retailers such as Levi Strauss & Co.,
Wall-Mart, JC Penny and Tropical Sportswear, among others. In 2002, the Company
created a new division under the TEKFIT brand name. This division develops and
sells apparel components that utilize the patented Pro-Fit technology, including
a stretch waistband. These products are sold to the same customers that are
targeted by the Company MANAGED TRIM SOLUTION and TALON zipper divisions.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company generates revenue primarily from two sources     o    Trim product sales, including zippers and waistbands, and
o    Complete trim package sales under our MANAGED TRIM SOLUTION.                    37                TAG-IT PACIFIC, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Trim product and trim package sales are recorded at the time of
shipment, at which point title transfers to the customer, and when collection is
reasonably assured.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Standard No. 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS 130, issued by the FASB and effective
for financial statements with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.
SFAS 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income
and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. There
were no additional comprehensive income items for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001.
CLASSIFICATION OF EXPENSES
COST OF SALES - Cost of good sold includes expenses primarily related
to inventory purchases, customs, duty, freight and overhead expenses. Overhead
expenses primarily consist of warehouse and operations salaries, and warehouse
expenses.
SELLING EXPENSE - Selling expenses primarily include royalty expense,
selling salaries, commissions, marketing and other selling expenses, including
travel and entertainment.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES - General and administrative
expenses  primarily include  administrative  salaries,  employee benefits,
professional service fees, facility expenses, information technology, investor
relations, travel and entertainment, depreciation, bad debts and other general
corporate expenses.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS
In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 00-10, Accounting
for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, the Company records shipping and
handling costs billed to customers as a component of revenue, and shipping and
handling costs incurred by the Company for inbound and outbound freight are
recorded as a component of cost of sales.
SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Standard No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS
131, issued by the FASB and effective for financial statements with fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1997. SFAS 131 requires that public companies
report certain information about operating segments, products, services and
geographical areas in which they operate and their major customers. The Company
believes that it operates within one segment as there is not enough difference
between the types of products developed and distributed by the Company to
justify segmented reporting by product type. Management decisions regarding the
allocation of resources and the assessment of performance are made on a
company-wide basis and are not specific to the type of product. Adoption of SFAS
131 resulted in expanded disclosures regarding geographical regions Note 15.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or
market net realizable value.                    38                TAG-IT PACIFIC, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of property
and equipment, applicable cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are
removed from the accounts and any gains or losses are included in results of
operations. The Company capitalizes the cost of films, dies, molds and art
designs. The costs capitalized include direct material and direct labor costs.
Depreciation  of property and  equipment is computed  using the
straight-line method based on estimated useful lives as follows     Furniture and fixtures          5 years
Machinery and equipment          5 to 10 years
Computer equipment            5 years
Leasehold improvements          Term  of the lease or the
estimated life of the related
improvements,  whichever is
shorter.
Films, dies, molds and art designs    3 to 5 years
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142 which requires, among
other things, that the Company no longer amortize goodwill, but instead test
goodwill for impairment at least annually. In addition, SFAS 142 requires that
the Company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential
future impairments of goodwill, reassess the useful lives of other existing
recognized intangible assets, and cease amortization of intangible assets with
an indefinite useful life. The Company previous business combinations were
accounted for using the purchase method. As of December 31, 2003, the net
carrying amount of goodwill is $450,000, tradename is $4,110,750 and other
intangible assets is $375,375. Management has determined that goodwill and
tradename have indefinite lives.  Amortization  expense related to other
intangibles amounted to $115,500 and $86,625 for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial
statements to conform with 2003 presentation.
INCOME TAXES
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences
between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to reverse. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The provision for
income taxes represents the tax payable or benefit for the period and the change
during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities.                    39                TAG-IT PACIFIC, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, establishes a fair value method of
accounting for stock-based compensation plans and for transactions in which a
company acquires goods or services from non-employees in exchange for equity
instruments. SFAS 123 also gives the option to account for employee stock-based
compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB
25, Accounting for Stock issued to Employees, or SFAS 123. The Company has
chosen to account for stock-based compensation for employees utilizing the
intrinsic value method prescribed in APB 25 and not the fair value method
established by SFAS 123. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options is
measured as the excess, if any, of the fair market price of the Company stock
at the measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire stock.
All stock options issued to employees had an exercise price not less than the
fair market value of the Company Common Stock on the date of grant, and in
accounting for such options utilizing the intrinsic value method there is no
related compensation expense recorded in the Company financial statements for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.
Under SFAS 123, the Company presents in a footnote the effect of
measuring the cost of stock-based employee compensation at the grant date based
on the fair value of the award and recognizes this cost over the service period.
The value of the stock-based award is determined using a pricing model whereby
compensation cost is the fair value of the option as determined by the model at
grant date or other measurement date.
All stock options issued to employees had an exercise price not less
than the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on the date of grant,
and in accounting for such options utilizing the intrinsic value method there is
no related compensation expense recorded in the Company financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. If compensation cost for
stock-based compensation had been determined based on the fair market value of
the stock options on their dates of grant in accordance with SFAS 123, the
Company net loss income and loss income per share for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 would have amounted to the pro forma amounts
presented below                            2003      2002       2001
Net loss income, as reported..  $ 4,744,658  $  1,496,026  $ 1,225,751

Diluted - pro forma..  $    048  $    013  $    020     The fair value of option grants is estimated on the date of grant
utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions for options granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001; expected
life of option of 15 years, expected volatility of 19% for 2003 and 2002 and
17% for 2001                    40                TAG-IT PACIFIC, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
risk free interest rate of 3% for 2003 and 2002 and 5% for 2001 and a 0%
dividend yield. The weighted average fair value at the grant date for such
options is $37, $38 and $37 per option for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate that value. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DUE FROM FACTOR: Due to the
short-term nature of the receivables, the fair value approximates the carrying
value. DUE FROM RELATED PARTIES AND NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES: Due to the
short-term nature and current market borrowing rates of the loans and notes, the
fair value approximates the carrying value. LINE OF CREDIT AND NOTES PAYABLE:
Estimated to approximate fair value based upon current market borrowing rates
for loans with similar terms and maturities.
RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
Upon approval of a restructuring plan by management, the Company
records restructuring reserves for certain costs associated with facility
closures and business reorganization activities as they are incurred or when
they become probable and estimable. Such costs are recorded as a current
liability. Restructuring costs associated with initiatives commenced prior to
January 1, 2003 were recorded in compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force No.
94-3 as a current liability.
For initiatives  after December 31, 2002, the Company  recorded
restructuring reserves in compliance with SFAS 146, resulting in the recognition
of employee  severance  and related  termination  benefits for recurring
arrangements when they became probable and estimable and on the accrual basis
for one-time benefit arrangements. The Company records other costs associated
with exit activities as they are incurred. Employee severance and termination
benefits are  estimates  based on  agreements  with the relevant  union
representatives or plans adopted by the Company that are applicable to employees
not affiliated with unions. These costs are not associated with nor do they
benefit continuing activities. Inherent in the estimation of these costs are
assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant
actions to accomplish the restructuring. Changing business conditions may affect
the assumptions related to the timing and extent of facility closure activities.
The Company reviews the status of restructuring activities on a quarterly basis
and, if appropriate, records changes based on updated estimates.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104 SAB No. 104, REVENUE RECOGNITION, which
codifies, revises and rescinds certain sections of SAB No. 101, REVENUE
Recognition, in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with
current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and
regulations. The changes noted in SAB No. 104 did not have a material effect on
our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position or
consolidated cash flows.                    41                TAG-IT PACIFIC, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN
INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY FAS 150,
which establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. FAS 150
requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument that is within its scope,
which may have previously been reported as equity, as a liability or an asset
in some circumstances. This statement is effective at the beginning of the
first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 for public companies. The
Company adopted this Statement as of July 1, 2003 and it had no material impact
on its financial statements.
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, AMENDMENT OF STATEMENT
133 ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES FAS No. 149. FAS No.
149 amends and clarifies the accounting guidance on derivative instruments
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and
hedging activities that fall within the scope of FAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. FAS No. 149 also amends certain
other existing pronouncements, which will result in more consistent reporting of
contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded
derivatives that warrant separate accounting. This Statement is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, with certain exceptions,
and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The Company does
not have any contracts that are  derivatives or that contain  embedded
derivatives.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB  Interpretation  No. 46,
CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, an interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletins ARB No. 51, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FIN 46.
FIN 46 clarifies the application of ARB No. 51 to certain entities in which
equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial
interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on the Company financial
position and results of operations.
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION -- TRANSITION AND
DISCLOSURE FAS 148, which amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FAS 123. FAS 148 provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, FAS 148
amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require more prominent and more
frequent disclosures in financial statements of the effects of stock-based
compensation. The transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of FAS
148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The interim
disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing condensed
financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The
adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated
balance sheet or results of operations as the Company intends to continue to
account for its equity based compensation plans using the intrinsic value
method. The Company provided the interim disclosures required by FAS 148
beginning in the first quarter of 2003.
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, GUARANTOR'S
ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT
GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS TO OTHERS, an interpretation of FASB Statements No.
5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB  Interpretation  No. 34. This
interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees
issued. The interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to
recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the
interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December
31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on the Company
financial statements. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial
statements of interim and annual periods ending after December 31, 2002. The
Company adopted this Statement as of January 1, 2003 and it had no material
impact on its financial statements.                    42                TAG-IT PACIFIC, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In June 2002, the FASB issued FAS No. 146, ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS
ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES, which addresses accounting for
restructuring and similar costs. FAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting
guidance, principally Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 94-3. The
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 146 for restructuring activities
initiated after December 31, 2002. FAS No. 146 requires that the liability for
costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred. Under EITF No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was
recognized at the date of a company commitment to an exit plan. FAS No. 146
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at
fair value. Accordingly, FAS No. 146 affects the timing of recognizing current
and future restructuring costs as well as the amount recognized.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 3--DUE FROM FACTOR
The Company has entered into a factoring agreement with East Asia
Heller for the purchase of eligible receivables from its Hong Kong subsidiary,
Tag-It Pacific Limited. The Company factor purchases eligible accounts
receivable and assumes the credit risk with respect to those accounts for which
they have given their prior approval. If the factor does not assume the credit
risk for a receivable, the collection risk associated with the receivable
remains with the Company. The Company pays a fixed commission rate and may
borrow up to 80% of its eligible accounts receivable. Interest is charged at
15% over the Hong Kong Dollar prime rate 65% and 5% at December 31, 2003 and
2002. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the amount factored with recourse and
included in trade accounts receivable was approximately $316,000 and $241,000.
Outstanding advances as of December 31, 2003 amounted to approximately $411,000
and are included in the line of credit balance. There were no outstanding
advances as of December 31, 2002.
The Company also has a factoring agreement with UPS Capital Global
Trade Finance Corporation, whereby UPS Capital purchases eligible accounts
receivable and assumes the credit risk with respect to those foreign accounts
for which UPS Capital has given its prior approval. If UPS Capital does not
assume the credit risk for a receivable, the collection risk associated with the
receivable remains with us. The Company pays a fixed commission rate and may
borrow up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable under the credit facility.
Included in due from factor as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 are trade accounts
receivable factored without recourse of approximately $65,000 and $292,000.
Included in due from factor are outstanding advances due to UPS Capital under
this factoring arrangement amounting to approximately $55,000 and $248,000 at
December 31, 2003 and 2002.
The Company measures the value of its retained interest in receivables
factored without recourse based on the fair value of the factored receivable at
the time the sale is initiated. Fair value is determined based on management
estimate of the expected amount to be collected from the factored receivable.
Adjustments to the fair value of the Company retained interest in the factored
receivable are made when management becomes aware of factors that could result
in a reduction of the amount paid by the customer. Adjustments are charged to
operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustments
become known. The Company has not recorded any adjustments to reduce the
carrying amount of its retained interest in factored receivables for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.
NOTE 4--TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Trade accounts receivable and trade accounts receivable related parties
are net of allowances for doubtful accounts and subsequent returns. For the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the total allowance for doubtful
accounts and subsequent returns was $2,043,571 and $401,485.

dates correspond to the expiration dates of the options for which they were
exchanged. At October 10, 1998, options to purchase 70,500 shares of Common
Stock previously granted under the 1997 Plan had been canceled in accordance

At December 31, 2003, Tag-It Pacific, Inc. had Federal and state NOL
carryforwards of approximately $9,243,000 and $5,084,000, respectively. The
Federal NOL is available to offset future taxable income through 2023, and the
state NOL expires in 2013. The Company ability to utilize NOL carryforwards
are dependent upon the Company ability to generate taxable income in the
future.
Deferred tax assets are initially recognized for differences between
the financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities which will result in future deductible amounts and operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is then established to
reduce that deferred tax asset to the level at which it is more likely than
not that the tax benefits will be realized. Realization of tax benefits of
deductible temporary differences and operating loss or credit carryforwards
depends on having                    56                TAG-IT PACIFIC, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character within
the carryback and carryforward periods. Sources of taxable income that may allow
for the realization of tax benefits include i taxable income in the current
year or prior years that is available through carryback, ii future taxable
income that will result from the reversal of existing taxable temporary
difference, and iii future taxable income generated by future operations.
Based on an evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax asset,
management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will
realize this tax benefit.

CONTINGENCIES
The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising
in connection with its business. In the opinion of management, there are
currently no claims that will have a material adverse effect on the Company
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
On December 31, 2002,  the Company  indirectly  guaranteed  the
indebtedness of two of its suppliers through the issuance by a related party of
letters of credit to purchase goods and equipment totaling $15 million.
Financing costs due to this related party amounted to approximately $15,000. The
letters of credit expired on March 27, 2003 and June 26, 2003. There were no
letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2003.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN No. 45 Guarantor Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others - and interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107
and rescission of FIN 34. The following is a summary of the Company
agreements that it has determined are within the scope of FIN 45     In accordance with the bylaws of the Company, officers and directors
are indemnified for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the
officer or director serving in such capacity. The term of the indemnification
period is for the lifetime of the officer or director. The maximum potential
amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under the
indemnification provisions of its bylaws is unlimited. However, the Company has
a director and officer liability insurance policy that reduces its exposure and
enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of its
insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of the
indemnification provisions of its bylaws is minimal and therefore, the Company
has not recorded any related liabilities.
The Company enters into indemnification provisions under its agreements
with investors and its agreements with other parties in the normal course of
business, typically with suppliers, customers and landlords. Under these
provisions, the Company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified
party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of
the Company activities or, in some cases, as a result of the indemnified
party activities under the agreement. These indemnification provisions often
include indemnifications relating to representations made by the Company with
regard to intellectual property rights. These indemnification  provisions
generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential
amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these
indemnification provisions is unlimited. The Company has not incurred material
costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification
agreements. As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these
agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any related
liabilities.
NOTE 15--GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
The Company specializes in the distribution of a full range of trim
items to manufacturers of fashion apparel, specialty retailers and mass
merchandisers. There is not enough difference between the types of products
developed and distributed by the Company to account for these products
separately or to justify segmented reporting by product type.                    58                TAG-IT PACIFIC, INC.

In August 1999, Mark Dyne, Chairman of the Board of Directors, loaned
the Company $160,000. This indebtedness is evidenced by an unsecured promissory
note dated August 17, 1999. The principal, which bears an interest rate at 7%
per annum, and interest are due and payable on demand. The Company repaid
$95,205 of the principal balance during the year ended December 31, 2001.
Transportation fees paid to a company that has common ownership with
Mark Dyne, Chairman of the Board of Directors, for the year ended December 31,
2003 amounted to $20,000.
Consulting fees paid to Diversified Investments, a company owned by a
member of the Board of Directors of the Company, amounted to $137,000, $150,000
and $150,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.                    60                TAG-IT PACIFIC, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Consulting fees paid for services provided by a member of the Board of
Directors amounted to $41,300, $70,800 and $64,900 for the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.
On February 1, 2001, options to purchase 15,000 shares of the Company
common stock held by a former director of the Company were exercised.
In October 1998, the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan. Under
the rights plan the Company distributed one preferred share purchase right for
each outstanding share of Common Stock outstanding on November 6, 1998. Upon the
occurrence of certain triggering events related to an unsolicited takeover
attempt of the Company, each purchase right not owned by the party or parties
making the unsolicited takeover attempt will entitle its holder to purchase
shares of the Company Series A Preferred Stock at a value below the then
market value of the Series A Preferred Stock. The rights of holders of the
Common Stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of
holders of the share purchase rights, the Series A Preferred Stock and any other
preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred
stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible
acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could make it more difficult for a
third party to acquire a majority of the Company outstanding voting stock.
NOTE 18 -RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
2003 RESTRUCTURING PLAN
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company implemented a plan to
restructure certain business operations. In accordance with the restructuring
plan, the Company incurred costs related to the reduction of its Mexico
operations, including the relocation of its Florida operations to North Carolina
and the downsizing of its corporate operations by eliminating certain corporate
expenses  related to  operations,  sales and  marketing and general and
administrative expenses. The reduction of operations in Mexico was in response
to the following     o    An anticipated reduction in sales volume from the Company
larger Mexico customers     o    The Company efforts to decrease its reliance on its larger
Mexico customers     o    The difficulty in obtaining financing in Mexico due to the
location of assets outside the U.S. and customer concentration
and other limits imposed by financial institutions.
The reduction of operations in Mexico is estimated to reduce the
Company working capital requirements and improve its cash flow, among other
things.
Total restructuring charges for the year ended 2003 amounted to
$7,700,047.  Restructuring  charges include approximately $43 million of
inventory write-downs, $16 million of additional reserves for doubtful accounts
receivable, $1 million of costs incurred related to the reduction of operations
in Mexico, including the relocation of inventory and facilities, $500,000 of
benefits paid to terminated employees and $300,000 of other costs. The Company
does not anticipate any further charges as a result of this restructuring plan.
All restructuring costs were incurred and paid for in the fourth quarter of 2003
and, therefore, there are no liabilities related to restructuring charges
included in the balance sheet at December 31, 2003.
Restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2003 related to
the following expense categories included in the Company statement of
operations are as follows                    61                TAG-IT PACIFIC, INC.
