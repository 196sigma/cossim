NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies and practices followed by Brass Eagle Inc. Brass Eagle are as follows Description of Business: Brass Eagle is a leading manufacturer of paintball markers, paintballs, protective eyewear, hoppers and other paintball accessories. Brass Eagle sells its products through major domestic and international retailers and paintball specialty stores. 
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Brass Eagle Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its investments in affiliates that are greater than fifty percent. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Revenue Recognition and Warranty: Brass Eagle recognizes revenue upon shipment of product. Brass Eagle products provide for warranties ranging from 3 months to 12 months. The accrued warranty obligation is provided at the time of product sale based on management estimates, which are developed from historical information and certain assumptions about future events, which are subject to change.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash includes cash, time deposits, and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for additions and improvements, which significantly extend the lives of assets, are capitalized. Upon sale or other retirement of depreciable property, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations.
Assets are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets, ranging from three to thirty-nine years, using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the useful life, using the straight-line method.
Pre-opening costs: Pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred. Pre-opening costs associated with the opening of Challenge Park Extreme in 2000 are included in selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000. These costs were approximately $349.
Intangible Assets: Intangible assets, including the Brass Eagle name and goodwill associated with the JT USA, L. P. and CM Support acquisitions are stated at amortized cost. Intangible assets were being amortized over the useful life of the assets, primarily 15 to 20 years on a straight-line basis. Accumulated amortization was $4,594 and $2,516 as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Adoption of FAS 142 will result in the cessation of goodwill amortization in 2002. Goodwill amortization expense was $1,958 for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Financial Instruments: The carrying value of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these items. 
Brass Eagle adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended on June 29, 2000, on January 1, 2001. Brass Eagle entered into an interest rate swap to convert a portion of the floating rate debt to a fixed rate. Brass Eagle formally assesses, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. Adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in recording the fair value of the interest rate swap of $889 $540 net of the tax effect as a liability in the balance sheet on December 31, 2001. The offsetting adjustment is reported in the statement of other comprehensive income.
The remaining portion of the long-term debt outstanding is floating rate debt, the carrying value of which approximates fair value.
Advertising Costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs included in selling and marketing expenses were $754, $539 and $625 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Income Taxes: The provision for income taxes includes federal and state taxes currently payable and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using current tax rates.
Brass Eagle has a tax allocation agreement, which provides for the settlement of certain tax attributes as described in Note 12. The tax allocation agreement also provides that income taxes would be payable on the same basis as if Brass Eagle had filed a separate income tax return for years prior to the spin-off.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, warranty reserve and reserve for slow moving inventory.

If Brass Eagle fully-loaded fixed charge coverage ratio falls below 1:00 to 1:00, Brass Eagle will pay a 25 basis point premium above the stated pricing spr
eads until such time that it reports a fully-loaded fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of 1:00 to 1:00. The agreement also limits capital expenditures to $40 million in 2000, excluding expenditures for Challenge Park Extreme, and $45 million in 2001, excluding the Nittan assets described in Note 18, and 45 million in 2002. Brass Eagle was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2001.

This statement gives entities a chance to recognize related compensation expense by adopting the new fair-value method or to measure compensation using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25, the former standard. If the former standard for measurement is elected, SFAS No. 123 requires supplemental disclosure to show the effects of using the new measurement criteria. The company uses the intrinsic value prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25. However, pro forma disclosures as if Brass Eagle adopted the cost recognition requirements under SFAS 123 are presented below.
Brass Eagle has 968,027 options outstanding at December 31, 2001, 703,291 of which are held by Brass Eagle employees. The remaining 264,736 options were granted to Daisy employees, including approximately 236,824 options held by Marvin Griffin, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Brass Eagle and Daisy. Options totaling 545,800 are outstanding from grants under Brass Eagle 1997 Stock Option Plan. The remaining 422,227 shares were granted under plans established by Daisy prior to the reorganization. The options granted under the Daisy plans were converted to options to purchase Brass Eagle common stock effective with the reorganization. 
The 1997 stock option plan, as amended on December 18, 2000, has reserved 607,700 shares to be granted to key employees and consultants at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. No options may be issued for less than the fair market of Brass Eagle common stock value at the date of grant. Options granted under the plan are exercisable at such times and upon such terms, as the Compensation Committee shall determine. All options granted under the plan to date vest equally over a four-year period. The options under this plan expire ten years after the date of grant.
On November 19, 1999, Brass Eagle repriced options granted in 1999 and 1998 from $1525 and $1550 a share to $800 a share. No compensation expense was recorded at that time because the modified exercise price equaled or exceeded the fair market value of Brass Eagle common stock on the repricing date. In accordance with FASB Interpretation Number 44, the repricing of the options changed the repriced options from fixed to variable. As a result, compensation expense will be recognized in future periods based on fluctuations in the market price of Brass Eagle stock above $8 per share.

443 No compensation expense was recorded under APB Opinion No. 25 for the years ended December 31 in 2001, 2000 and 1999 because the exercise price equaled or exceeded the fair market value of the options on the dates of grant. 
If compensation cost for Brass Eagle stock option plan had been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for options awarded in the years ended December 31, 1999 through 2001 under this plan consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS 123, including the compensation expense in conjunction with repricing certain 2001, 2000 and 1999 options, Brass Eagle pro forma net income and basic and diluted earnings per share would have differed from amounts reported as follows 2001

The options granted under the Daisy plans include 187,753 options granted on June 30, 1993 and 256,737 shares granted at the discretion of Daisy compensation committee prior to the initial public offering. These options are exercisable at a fixed exercise price of $056 per share until September 15, 2002 and June 1, 2003, respectively. Options totaling 22,331 that were granted by the Daisy compensation committee were exercised during the year ended December 31, 1998. The exercise price of the options granted by Daisy was generally equal to or greater than the fair market value at the date of grant. Fair market value was determined by Daisy Board of Directors.
NOTE 15 - BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the basic shares outstanding plus the weighted average outstanding stock options during the periods presented. Certain stock options granted in 1999 and 1998 are anti-dilutive and for purposes of calculating the diluted earnings per share these options have been excluded. These shares may become dilutive in the future.
A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 are presented below. 2001
