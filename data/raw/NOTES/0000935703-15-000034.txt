Unless otherwise indicated, references to we, our or Dollar Tree refer to Dollar Tree, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and do not give effect to the proposed acquisition of Family Dollar Stores, Inc25Key Events and Recent DevelopmentsSeveral key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations. You should keep in mind that:On March 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement and term loan facilities and received $395 billion under the Term Loan B which is being held in escrow pending the consummation of the Family Dollar acquisition. On February 23, 2015, we completed the offering of $325 billion of acquisition notes which we expect to use in connection with our financing of the Family Dollar acquisition. The acquisition notes were issued by a wholly owned subsidiary of Dollar Tree and the proceeds of the offering are being held in escrow pending the consummation of the Family Dollar acquisition.On January 22, 2015, Family Dollar Stores, Inc. shareholders voted to approve our acquisition of Family Dollar.In January 2015, we completed a 270,000 square foot expansion of our distribution center in Joliet, Illinois. The Joliet distribution center is now a 1,470,000 square foot, fully automated facility.On July 27, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire Family Dollar in a cash and stock transaction.On September 17, 2013, we entered into agreements with JP Morgan Chase Bank to repurchase $10 billion of our common stock under a variable maturity accelerated share repurchase program, 50% of which was collared and 50% of which was uncollared.On September 16, 2013, we completed a private placement with institutional investors of $750 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The Senior Notes include three tranches with $300 million of 403% Senior Notes due in September 2020, $350 million of 463% Senior Notes due in September 2023 and $100 million of 478% Senior Notes due in September 2025.On September 13, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $20 billion of our common stock. This authorization replaced all previous authorizations. At January 31, 2015, we had $10 billion remaining under Board repurchase authorization.In August 2013, we completed a 401,000 square foot expansion of our distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma. The Marietta distribution center is now a 1,004,000 square foot, fully automated facility.In June 2013, we completed construction on a new 10 million square foot distribution center in Windsor, Connecticut. In March 2013, we leased an additional 04 million square feet at our distribution center in San Bernardino, California. The San Bernardino distribution center is now an 802,000 square foot facility.On June 6, 2012, we entered into a five-year $7500 million Unsecured Credit Agreement which provides for a $7500 million revolving line of credit, including up to $1500 million in available letters of credit.The interest rate on the facility is based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. OverviewOur net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise.Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends.First is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through acquisitions.Second, sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next.We refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we compare only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared.We include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales.The term 'expanded' also includes stores that are relocated.At January31, 2015, we operated 5,367 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, and five Canadian provinces, with 465 million selling square feet compared to 4,992 stores with 432 million selling square feet at February1, 2014.During fiscal 2014, we opened 391 stores, expanded 72 stores and closed 16 stores, compared to 343 new stores opened, 71 stores expanded and 22 stores closed during fiscal 2013.In the current year we increased our selling square footage by 74%. Of the 32 million selling square foot increase in 2014, 02 million was added by expanding existing stores.The average size of our stores opened in 2014was approximately 8,060 selling square feet or about 10,000 gross square feet.For 2015, we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet or about 10,000 - 12,000 gross square feet.We believe that this store size is our optimal size operationally and that this size also gives our customers an ideal shopping environment that invites them to shop longer and buy more.Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 which ended on January 31, 2015, and February 1, 2014, respectively, each included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2012 ended on February 2, 2013 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. The 53rd week in 2012 added approximately $125 million in sales. 26In fiscal 2014, comparable store net sales increased by 43%.The comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 34% increase in the number of transactions and a 09% increase in average ticket.We believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our initiatives, as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2014, and we continued the roll-out of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our stores.At January31, 2015we had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 3,620 stores compared to approximately 3,160 stores at February1, 2014.We believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers.In addition, we accept food stamps under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP in approximately 5,000 qualified stores compared to 4,620 at the end of 2013. Our point-of-sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores.We believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations.We must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these line items could negatively impact our operating results.Pending AcquisitionOn July 27, 2014, we executed an Agreement and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement to acquire Family Dollar in a cash and stock transaction the Acquisition. Under the Acquisition, which was approved by Family Dollar shareholders on January 22, 2015, the Family Dollar shareholders will receive $5960 in cash plus no more than 03036 and no less than 02484 shares of our common stock for each share of Family Dollar common stock they own. On January 31, 2015, Family Dollar had approximately 1145 million outstanding shares of common stock. Due to the vesting of outstanding equity awards, Family Dollar is expected to have up to an additional 20 million shares of common stock outstanding at closing in connection with the Acquisition. Family Dollar stock options and RSUs will convert into options and RSUs in our common stock. After the Acquisition, we expect that former Family Dollar stockholders will own no more than 151% and no less than 127% of the outstanding shares of Dollar Tree common stock. The transaction is subject to expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act HSR Act and satisfaction or waiver of the other customary closing conditions. On or before closing, we expect to incur approximately $2100 million in acquisition-related expenses, of which $752 million were incurred in 2014 including $335 million that was paid in 2014. During 2014, $285 million of acquisition-related expenses were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and $467 million related to commitment fees were recorded in interest expense, net. We expect to incur an additional $226 million in commitment fees in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We also expect to expend approximately $1740 million in capitalizable debt issuance costs related to the financing of the Acquisition. In connection with the Acquisition, we expect to pay off most of our and Family Dollar existing debt, and obtain approximately $95 billion in bank and bond financing to recapitalize the combined company and finance the Acquisition and ongoing operations. On February 23, 2015 we completed the offering of $325 billion of acquisition notes and on March 9, 2015 we received funding under the $395 billion Term Loan B in connection with the financing. The proceeds of the acquisition notes and Term Loan B are being held in escrow pending consummation of the Acquisition. Please see Note 11 - Pending Acquisition and Related Debt beginning on Page 61 of this Form 10-K included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the financing.We expect to achieve approximately $300 million in annual cost savings synergies by the end of the third year after closing, and that we will incur $300 million in one-time costs to achieve those synergies. We project that the Acquisition will be dilutive to earnings per share in the first twelve months following closing on a GAAP basis; however, we expect it will be accretive excluding the one-time costs to achieve synergies. 27Results of OperationsYear EndedJanuary 31,2015February 1,2014February 2,2013Net sales1000%1000%1000%Cost of sales647%644%641%Gross profit353%356%359%Selling, general and administrative  income121%124%124%Interest expense, net09%02%%Other income expense, net01%%08%Income before income taxes111%122%132%Provision for income taxes41%46%48%Net income70%76%84%Fiscal year ended January31, 2015compared to fiscal year ended February1, 2014Net sales.Net sales increased 97%, or $7619 million, in 2014 compared to 2013, resulting from sales in our new stores and a 43% increase in comparable store net sales. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones.The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended January31, 2015and February1, 2014.January 31, 2015February 1, 2014New stores391343Expanded or relocated stores7271Closed stores1622Of the 32 million selling square foot increase in 2014approximately 02 million was added by expanding existing stores. Gross profit.Gross profit margin was 353% in 2014 compared to 356% in 2013 due to increased freight costs partially offset by leverage in occupancy costs from the higher comparable store sales increase. Selling, general and administrative expenses.Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, remained at 232% for 2014 compared to 2013.Excluding $285 million or approximately 35 basis points of expenses related to the Family Dollar acquisition, the selling, general and administrative rate was 229%. The decrease is primarily due to lower store payroll, health insurance and workers' compensation costs.Operating income.Operating income margin was 121% in 2014 compared to 124% in 2013. Excluding the approximately 35 basis points of acquisition-related expenses, operating income margin was 124% in 2014 as lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were offset by lower gross profit margin for the reasons noted above.Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net increased $647 million due to $467 million of commitment fees related to the financing of the Family Dollar acquisition and a full year of interest expense on the $7500 million of senior notes issued in September 2013.Other income expense, net.Other income expense, net in 2014 increased $56 million primarily due to unfavorable fair market value adjustments for our diesel fuel hedges.Income taxes.Our effective tax rate was 372% in 2014 compared to 375% in 2013. The rate decrease is the result of lower state tax rates and additional work opportunity tax credits in 201428Fiscal year ended February1, 2014compared to fiscal year ended February2, 2013Net sales.Net sales increased 60%, or $4458 million, in 2013 compared to 2012, resulting from sales in our new stores and a 24% increase in comparable store net sales. Excluding the 53rd week in 2012, which accounted for approximately $1250 million of sales, net sales increased 79%, or $5708 million. The comparable store net sales increase is based on the comparable 52 weeks for both years. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing ones.The following table summarizes the components of the changes in our store count for fiscal years ended February1, 2014and February2, 2013.February 1, 2014February 2, 2013New stores343345Expanded or relocated stores7187Closed stores2225Of the 27 million selling square foot increase in 2013 approximately 02 million was added by expanding existing stores. Gross profit.Gross profit margin was 356% in 2013 compared to 359% in 2012 due to loss of leverage in occupancy and distribution cost from the 53rd week of sales in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses.Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 232% for 2013 compared to 235% for 2012.The decrease is primarily due to lower incentive compensation achievement in 2013 compared with 2012 and lower inventory service fees.Operating income.Operating income margin was 124% in 2013 and 2012 due to the reasons noted above.Other income expense, net.Other income expense, net in 2012 includes a $608 million gain on the sale of our investment in Ollie Holdings, Inc.Income taxes.Our effective tax rate was 375% in 2013 compared to 367% in 2012. The rate increase is the result of statute expirations and the settlement of state tax audits in 2012.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate and expand existing stores.Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal and usually reach their peak in September and October.Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities.The following table compares cash-flow related information for the years ended January31, 2015, February1, 2014and February2, 2013:Year EndedJanuary 31,February 1,February 2,in millions201520142013Net cash provided by used in:Operating    cash provided by operating activities increased $1327 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to an increase in accrued expenditures related to the Family Dollar acquisition and a decrease in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories29Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1158 million in 2013 compared to 2012 due to a decrease in cash used for prepaid rent and purchasing merchandise inventory partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable.Net cash used in investing activities decreased $100 million in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to reduced capital expenditures, increased proceeds on fixed asset dispositions and reduced purchases of restricted investments.Net cash used in investing activities increased $631 million in 2013 primarily due to the impact from $623 million in proceeds from the sale of the investment in Ollie Holdings, Inc. in 2012.In 2014, net cash used in financing activities decreased $5832 million compared to 2013 primarily due to $11 billion of share repurchases and the repayment of $2500 million in long-term debt in 2013 partially offset by the issuance of the $7500 million of Senior Notes in 2013.In 2013, net cash used in financing activities increased $2944 million as a result of an increase in share repurchases in 2013 and the repayment of the $2500 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility partially offset by $7500 million of proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes.At January31, 2015, our long-term borrowings were $7570 million.We also have $1100 million, $1000 million and $200 million Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreements, under which approximately $1629 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at January31, 2015.In September 2013, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with institutional accredited investors in which we issued and sold $7500 millionof senior notes the Notes in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The Notes consist of three tranches: $3000 millionof 403%Senior Notes due September16, 2020; $3500 millionof 463%Senior Notes due September16, 2023; and $1000 millionof 478%Senior Notes due September16, 2025. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The Notes are unsecured and rank pari passu in right of repayment with our other senior unsecured indebtedness. We may prepay some or all of the Notes at any time in an amount not less than 5% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid, at a price equal to the sum of a 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and b the applicable make-whole amount. In the event of a change in control as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, we may be required to prepay the Notes. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. We used the net proceeds of the Notes to finance share repurchases. On January 20, 2015, we entered into the First Amendment the Notes Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement,with a majority of the noteholders party thereto. The Notes Amendment was entered into in connection with our pending acquisition the Acquisition of Family Dollar Stores, Inc. Family Dollar. The Notes Amendment will, among other things, allow a newly-formed subsidiary of Dollar Tree to issue debt and hold the proceeds in escrow pending consummation of the Acquisition such debt, the Escrow Debt. Pursuant to the terms of the Notes Amendment, in certain circumstances the amount of interest due on the Notes may increase by 10% per annum. The Notes Amendment also contains certain negative covenants and other restrictions applicable during the period in which any Escrow Debt is outstanding. Upon closing of the Acquisition, we expect to fully repay the Notes which will result in the repayment of the $7500 million outstanding and the payment of approximately $1212 million of prepayment fees.In June 2012, we entered into a five-year $7500 million unsecured Credit Agreement the Agreement.The Agreement provides for a $7500 million revolving line of credit, including up to $1500 million in available letters of credit.The interest rate on the Agreement is based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin.The Agreement also bears a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly. The Agreement also bears an administrative fee payable annually.The Agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness.As of January31, 2015, no amount was outstanding under the $7500 million revolving line of credit.In September 2013, we amended the Agreement to enable the issuance of the Notes.On August 15, 2014, we entered into an amendment the Credit Amendment to the Agreement. The Credit Amendment further amends the Agreement to facilitate the issuance and/or borrowings of certain third-party debt financing that we may use to finance the Acquisition. The Credit Amendment also facilitates escrow arrangements related to the Acquisition.On February 23, 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary completed the offering of $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5250% senior notes due 2020 the 2020 notes and $2,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5750% senior notes 30due 2023 the 2023 notes, and together with the 2020 notes, the acquisition notes. The acquisition notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended the Securities Act, and outside the United States, only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The acquisition notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws.We expect to use the proceeds of the acquisition notes to finance in part the Acquisition. The proceeds of the 2020 notes and the 2023 notes will be held in, and secured by liens on, separate escrow accounts with U.S. Bank National Association, as escrow agent the Escrow Agent, pending consummation of the Acquisition. We expect that, in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, our wholly owned subsidiary that issued the acquisition notes will merge with and into us, we will assume the obligations in respect of the acquisition notes, and the acquisition notes will be jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis, subject to certain exceptions, by each of our subsidiaries that guarantees the obligations under our new senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness, including Family Dollar and certain of its subsidiaries.The 2020 notes, which mature on March 1, 2020, were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 23, 2015, with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee the 2020 notes indenture. The 2023 notes, which mature on March 1, 2023, were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 23, 2015, with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee the 2023 notes indenture, and together with the 2020 notes indenture, the indentures.The indentures provide that if the Acquisition is not consummated before August 28, 2015, if the Escrow Agent has not received certain additional monthly deposits by certain dates, or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the acquisition notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price of 100% of the gross proceeds of the acquisition notes offered, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption.Interest on the acquisition notes is due semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2015. No principal is due on the acquisition notes within five years and annual interest is expected to be approximately $1831 million.The indentures contain covenants that, from and after the date of the Acquisition, will limit our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions: i incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness; ii declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to, or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value, equity interests; iii make any principal payment on, or redeem or repurchase, subordinated debt; iv make loans, advances or other investments; v incur liens; vi sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; vii consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all assets to, another person; and viii enter into transactions with affiliates. The indentures also provide for certain events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding acquisition notes under the applicable indenture to be declared immediately due and payable.On March 9, 2015, our wholly owned subsidiary entered into a credit agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for $6,200million in senior secured credit facilities the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisting of a $1,250million revolving credit facility the New Revolving Credit Facility and $4,950million of term loan facilities the New Term Loan Facilities. The New Term Loan Facilities consist of a $1,000million Term Loan A tranche and a $3,950million Term Loan B tranche. The New Revolving Credit Facility and the borrowings under the Term Loan A tranche will mature five years after the closing of the Acquisition, unless any of the 2020 notes remain outstanding as of 91 days prior to their stated maturity, in which case the New Revolving Credit Facility and the borrowings under the Term Loan A tranche will mature at such time. The borrowings under the Term Loan B tranche will mature seven years after the closing of the Acquisition. Annual interest expense on the New Term Loan Facilities is expected to approximate $1976 million.The proceeds of the borrowings under the Term Loan B tranche were deposited in an escrow account separate from the escrow accounts related to the acquisition notes and will be held in escrow prior to the closing of the Acquisition. Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, we will become the borrower under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and will draw the term loans under the Term Loan A facility and will have the ability to borrow under the New Revolving Credit Facility.The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will not be guaranteed by us or any of our subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, but upon consummation of the Acquisition the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be guaranteed by certain of our direct or indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, including Family Dollar and certain of its subsidiaries collectively, the Credit Agreement Guarantors. Upon the consummation of the Acquisition, we expect the New 31Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured by a security interest in substantially all the assets of Dollar Tree and the Credit Agreement Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.The loans under the Term Loan A tranche and the New Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus 225% per annum or a base rate plus 125%, and the Term Loan B tranche of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will bear interest at LIBOR plus 350% per annum or a base rate plus 250%.  The Term Loan B tranche will be subject to a LIBOR floor of 075%. The Term Loan A tranche of the New Term Loan Facilities will require quarterly amortization payments of 125% of the original principal amount thereof in the first year following the consummation of the Acquisition, 25% of the original principal amount thereof in the second year following the Acquisition, and 375% of the original principal amount thereof thereafter and the Term Loan B tranche requires quarterly amortization payments of 025% of the original principal amount thereof after the closing of the Acquisition. The New Term Loan Facilities also require mandatory prepayments in connection with certain asset sales and out of excess cash flow, among other things, and subject in each case to certain significant exceptions. We expect to pay certain commitment fees in connection with the New Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, the Term Loan B tranche of the New Term Loan Facilities will require us to pay a 100% prepayment fee if the loans thereunder are subject to certain repricing transactions before March 9, 2016.The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants that apply, in certain circumstances, before and after the closing of the Acquisition and are customary for similar financings. These include, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends, repay the acquisition notes, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with any other person. In addition, a financial maintenance covenant based on our consolidated first lien secured net leverage ratio will apply to the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan A tranche of the New Term Loan Facilities after the closing of the Acquisition.Historically we have used cash to repurchase shares but we did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2014.We repurchased 174 million shares for $1,1121 million in fiscal 2013.We repurchased 81 million shares for $3402 million in fiscal 2012.At January31, 2015, we have $10 billion remaining under Board repurchase authorization.Funding RequirementsOverview, Including Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2015to total approximately $2907million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs.Our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2015are between $4650 million and $4750 million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 320stores, the initial phases of work on our eleventh distribution center and the expansion of our Olive Branch, Mississippi distribution center.We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our existing credit facility.The following tables summarize our material contractual obligations at January31, 2015, including both on- and off-balance sheet arrangements, and our commitments, including interest on long-term borrowings in millions:Contractual  FinancingOperating lease  BorrowingsSenior notes75007500Forgivable promissory note7002141440Interest on long-term   in 2015Expiring in 2016Expiring in 2017Expiring in 2018Expiring in 2019ThereafterLetters of credit and surety   contracts168717126Total  FinancingOperating lease obligations.Our operating lease obligations are primarily for payments under noncancelable store leases.The commitment includes amounts for leases that were signed prior to January31, 2015for stores that were not yet open on January31, 2015.Long-term BorrowingsSenior notes. In September 2013, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with institutional accredited investors in which we issued and sold $7500 millionof senior notes the Notes in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The Notes consist of three tranches: $3000 millionof 403%Senior Notes due September16, 2020; $3500 millionof 463%Senior Notes due September16, 2023; and $1000 millionof 478%Senior Notes due September16, 2025. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. For complete terms of the Notes please see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 - Long-Term Debt beginning on page 54 of this Form 10-K.Demand revenue bonds.In May 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation under which it issued $190 million of variable-rate demand revenue bonds.We used the proceeds from the bonds to finance the acquisition, construction and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi.The bonds did not have a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remained variable.The bonds contained a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding amounts were classified as current liabilities.In 2014, we repaid the $128 million outstanding under the Demand Revenue Bonds and the debt was retired.Forgivable promissory note.In 2012, we entered into a promissory note with the state of Connecticut under which the state loaned us $70 millionin connection with our acquisition, construction and installation of land, building, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in Windsor, Connecticut. If certain performance targets are met, the loan and any accrued interest will be forgiven in fiscal 2017. If the performance targets are not met, the loan and accrued interest must be repaid over a five-year period beginning in fiscal 2017.Interest on long-term borrowings.These amounts represent interest payments on the Notes, and Forgivable Promissory Note using the interest rates for each at January31, 2015.CommitmentsLetters of credit and surety bonds.We are a party to three Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreements providing $1100 million, $1000 million and $200 million, respectively for letters of credit.Letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately $1629 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at January31, 2015.We also have approximately $119 million of letters of credit outstanding for our self-insurance programs and $42 million of surety bonds outstanding primarily for certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores.Technology assets.We have commitments totaling approximately $134 million to primarily purchase store technology assets and maintenance for our stores during 2015.Telecommunication contracts.We have contracted for telecommunication services with contracts expiring in 2017.The total amount of these commitments is approximately $168 million.Derivative Financial InstrumentsIn 2014 and 2013, we were party to fuel derivative contracts with third parties which included approximately 16 million and 28 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 10% and 20% of our domestic truckload fuel needs, respectively.These derivative contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings.We currently have fuel derivate contracts to hedge 66 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 40% of our domestic truckload fuel needs from February 2015 through January 201633Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates.Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantlyfrom those estimates.Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical.Inventory ValuationAs discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Account Policies under the caption Merchandise Inventories beginning on page 44 of this Form 10-K, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted-average basis.Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis.Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.The retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.Inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins.The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal, carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans.The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends.Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.Our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends.These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger.Our physical inventory counts are generally taken between January and September of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at January31, 2015is based on estimated shrink for most of 2014, including the fourth quarter.We have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 10-20 basis points in our Dollar Tree stores for the last few years.However, we have sometimes experienced higher than typical shrink in acquired stores in the year following an acquisition.We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to address these factors as they become apparent.Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis.Accrued ExpensesOn a monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred.Certain expenses, such as legal reserves, require a high degree of judgment and our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses, self-insurance costs, store-level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses.We are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. Our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. We review outstanding matters with external counsel to assess the probability of an unfavorable outcome and estimates of loss. We re-evaluate outstanding proceedings and claims each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. Our legal proceedings are described in Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies under the caption Contingencies beginning on Page 51 of this Form 10-K included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Our freight and store-level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results.Our workers' compensation, general liability and health insurance accruals are recorded based on actuarial valuations which are adjusted at least annually based on a review performed by a third-party actuary.For our workers' compensation and general liability accruals, these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors. For our health insurance accrual, the actuary provides an estimate based on historical claims and claim payment timing. Certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them.The related accruals are adjusted as managements estimates change34Differences in management estimates and assumptions could result in accruals which are materially different from the calculated accruals.Our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low.Historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Income TaxesOn a quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets.Our income taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates, including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing, applied to the income expected to be taxed currently.Management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and managements projections for future taxable income.We cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years.Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual.In addition, we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns.Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws, including relevant case law, and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority.Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.We believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate.For further discussion of our changes in reserves during 2014, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 48 of this Form 10-K.Seasonality and Quarterly FluctuationsWe experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue.Our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including:shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especiallyEaster;the timing of new store openings;the net sales contributed by new stores;changes in our merchandise mix; andcompetition.Our highest sales periods are the Christmas and Easter seasons.Easter was observed on March 31, 2013 and on April 20, 2014, and will be observed on April 5, 2015.We believe that the earlier Easter in 2015 could result in a $80 million decrease in sales in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014.We generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter.In anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff.Our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the Easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems, changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather. Our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Inflation and Other Economic FactorsOur ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control.Consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including unemployment and rising fuel prices.Reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales.National or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the United States or in foreign countries.These and other factors could increase our merchandise costs, fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates.Shipping Costs.Trans-Pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on shipping industry market conditions and fuel costs.We can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2015, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations.Minimum Wage.Multiple states and local jurisdictions passed legislation that increase their minimum wages in 2015 and 2016 and the federal government has made indications that it may consider increasing the federal minimum wage. As a result, 35we believe our expenses could increase unless we are able to offset the increase in payroll costs by operating more effectively or efficiently. Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes.We may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes.We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.Diesel Fuel Cost RiskIn order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs, we entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties.We hedged 16 million, 28 millionand 48 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively.These hedges represented approximately 10%, 20%and 35% of our total domestic truckload fuel needs in 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively.We currently have fuel derivate contracts to hedge 66 million gallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 40% of our domestic truckload fuel needs from February 2015 through January 2016. Under these contracts, we pay the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receive variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed-rate obligation.These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included in earnings.The fair value of these contracts as of January31, 2015was a liability of $57 million36Item 8.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January31, 2015and February1, 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended January31, 2015, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESDescription of BusinessDollar Tree, Inc. the Company is the leading operator of discount variety retail stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of $100or less with 5,367discount variety retail stores in the United States and Canada at January31, 2015.Below are those accounting policies considered by the Company to be significant.Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Dollar Tree, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries.All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Foreign CurrencyThe functional currencies of the Companys international subsidiaries are primarily the local currencies of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located.Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date.Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period.The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss.Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are included in other income expense, net have not been significant.Stock DividendOn May29, 2012, the Company Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100%common stock dividend. New shares were distributed on June26, 2012to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June12, 2012. Segment InformationThe Company retail stores represent a single operating segment based on the way the Company manages its business.Operating decisions are made at the Company level in order to maintain a consistent retail store presentation.The Companys retail stores sell similar products and services, use similar processes to sell those products and services, and sell their products and services to similar classes of customers.The amounts of long-lived assets and net sales outside of the U.S. were not significant for any of the periods presented.Fiscal YearThe Company fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31.Any reference herein to 2014 or Fiscal 2014, 2013 or Fiscal 2013, and 2012 or Fiscal 2012, relates to as of or for the years ended January31, 2015, February1, 2014, and February2, 2013, respectively. Fiscal 2012 ended on February 2, 2013 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. Fiscal 2014 and 2013 each included 52 weeks.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2015and February1, 2014includes $7886 millionand $1726 million, respectively, of investments primarily in money market securities which are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of 3months or less to be cash equivalents.The majority of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of debit card and credit card transactions process within 3business days, and therefore are classified as cash and cash equivalents.Merchandise InventoriesMerchandise inventories at the Companys distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market, determined on a weighted-average cost basis.Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis.Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories44Costs directly associated with warehousing and distribution are capitalized as merchandise inventories.Total warehousing and distribution costs capitalized into inventory amounted to $443 millionand $432 millionat January31, 2015and February1, 2014, respectively.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:Buildings39 to 40 yearsFurniture, fixtures and equipment3 to 15 yearsLeasehold improvements and assets held under capital leases are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the committed terms of the related leases, whichever is shorter.Amortization is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated income statements.Costs incurred related to software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized, generally over 3years.GoodwillGoodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually.In addition, goodwill will be tested on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred.The Company performed its annual impairment testing in November 2014and determined that no impairment loss existed.Other Assets, NetOther assets, net consists primarily of deferred financing costs, restricted investments and deferred compensation plan assets.Deferred financing costs represent costs directly related to debt issuances and are amortized over the terms of the related debt. Deferred financing costs, net of amortization, were $743 millionand $43 millionat January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively. Deferred financing costs of $702 millionrelate to debt to be issued in 2015 and were therefore not amortized in 2014. Included in the $702 millionare $584 millionof costs which have not been paid and are accrued in Other current liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet. Restricted investments were $789 millionand $879 millionat January31, 2015and February1, 2014, respectively and were purchased to collateralize long-term insurance obligations.These investments are primarily in tax-exempt money market funds that invest in short-term municipal obligations.These investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which approximates cost.Deferred compensation plan assets were $55 millionand $51 millionat January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, respectively and are recorded at fair value. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed OfThe Company reviews its long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets based on discounted cash flows or other readily available evidence of fair value, if any.Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.In fiscal 2014, 2013and 2012, the Company recorded charges of $15 million, $05 millionand $05 million, respectively, to write down certain assets.These charges are recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated income statements.Financial InstrumentsThe Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and diesel fuel costs.By entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate and diesel fuel swaps, the Company limits its exposure to changes in variable interest rates and diesel fuel prices.The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these instruments but minimizes this risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties.Interest rate or diesel fuel cost differentials paid or received on the swaps are recognized as adjustments to interest and freight expense, respectively, in the period earned or incurred.The Company formally documents all hedging relationships, if applicable, and assesses hedge effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis.Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.As a basis for considering such assumptions, a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair 45value.The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 measurements.The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; andLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.The Companys cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments and diesel fuel swaps represent the financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value as of January31, 2015and February1, 2014.As required, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.The Company assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.The fair value of the Companys cash and cash equivalents was $8641 millionand $2677 millionas of January31, 2015and February1, 2014, respectively. The fair value of the Company restricted investments was $789 millionand $879 millionas of January31, 2015and February1, 2014, respectively.These fair values were determined using Level 1 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the diesel fuel swaps was a liability of $57 millionas of January31, 2015. The Company did not have any active fuel derivative contracts as of February1, 2014. The fair values of the swaps were estimated using Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. These estimates used discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield and diesel cost curves. The curves were obtained from independent pricing services reflecting broker market quotes.The estimated fair value of the Companys long-term debt was $7009 millionas of January31, 2015and $7698 millionas of February1, 2014. The fair value of the Senior Notes is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis using Level 3 inputs as there are no quoted prices in active markets for these notes. The discount rate used in the analysis was based on borrowing rates available to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities, issued in the same private placement debt market. The carrying value of the Company Demand Revenue Bonds at February1, 2014approximates its fair value because the debt interest rate varies with market interest rates. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances e.g., when there is evidence of impairment.The Company recorded impairment charges of $15 million, $05 million, and $05 millionin fiscal 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively, to reduce certain store assets to their estimated fair values.The fair values were determined based on the income approach, in which the Company utilized internal cash flow projections over the life of the underlying lease agreements discounted based on a risk-free rate of return.These measures of fair value, and related inputs, are considered a level 3 approach under the fair value hierarchy.There were no other changes related to level 3 assets.Lease AccountingThe Company leases almost all of its retail locations under operating leases.The Company recognizes minimum rent expense beginning when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening.When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent.The Company also receives tenant allowances, which are recorded in deferred rent and are amortized as reductions of rent expense over the terms of the leases.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes sales revenue at the time a sale is made to its customer.Taxes CollectedThe Company reports taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on revenue-producing transactions i.e., sales tax on a net excluded from revenue basis.Cost of SalesThe Company includes the cost of merchandise, warehousing and distribution costs, and certain occupancy costs in cost of sales.Pre-Opening CostsThe Company expenses pre-opening costs for new, expanded and relocated stores, as incurred46Advertising CostsThe Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred and they are included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated income statements.Advertising costs approximated $181 million, $149 millionand $135 millionfor the years ended January31, 2015, February1, 2014, and February2, 2013, respectively.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such change.The Company recognizes a financial statement benefit for a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination.The Company includes interest and penalties in the provision for income tax expense and income taxes payable.The Company does not provide for any penalties associated with tax contingencies unless they are considered probable of assessment.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company recognizes expense for all share-based payments to employees based on their fair values.Total stock-based compensation expense for 2014, 2013and 2012was $374 million, $362 millionand $349 million, respectively.The Company recognizes expense related to the fair value of restricted stock units RSUs over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis or a shorter period based on the retirement eligibility of the grantee.The fair value is determined using the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant.Net Income Per ShareBasic net income per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur assuming the inclusion of dilutive potential shares and has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential shares outstanding.Dilutive potential shares include all outstanding stock options and unvested RSUs after applying the treasury stock method.NOTE 2 -

Of the net operating losses and credit carryforwards, $101 millionis included in the valuation allowance and the remaining amounts expire between 2020 and 2035. The company is participating in the Internal Revenue Service IRS Compliance Assurance Program CAP for the 2014fiscal year and will participate in the program for fiscal year 2015.This program accelerates the examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the tax return is filed.Our federal tax returns have been examined and all issues have been settled through our fiscal 2013 tax year.In addition, several states completed their examination during fiscal 2014.In general, fiscal years 2011 and forward are within the statute of limitations for state tax purposes.The statute of limitations is still open prior to 2011 for some states50The balance for unrecognized tax benefits at January31, 2015, was $65 million.The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at January31, 2015, that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $43 millionnet of the federal tax benefit.The following is a reconciliation of the Companys total gross unrecognized tax benefits:January31, 2015February1, 2014Beginning Balance$55$56Additions, based on tax positions related to current year0602Additions for tax positions of prior years0908Reductions for tax positions of prior  in statutes of limitation0506Ending balance$65$55During fiscal 2014, the Company accrued potential interest of $02 million, related to these unrecognized tax benefits.As of January31, 2015, the Company has recorded a liability for potential interest of $07 million.It is possible that state tax reserves will be reduced for audit settlements and statute expirations within the next 12months.At this point it is not possible to estimate a range associated with the resolution of these audits.NOTE 4 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESOperating Lease CommitmentsFuture minimum lease payments under noncancelable store and distribution center operating leases are as follows:in  minimum lease payments$2,6225The above future minimum lease payments include amounts for leases that were signed prior to January31, 2015for stores that were not open as of January31, 2015.Minimum rental payments for operating leases do not include contingent rentals that may be paid under certain store leases based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts.Future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by expected future minimum sublease rentals of $03 millionunder operating leases.Minimum and Contingent RentalsRental expense for store and distribution center operating leases including payments to related parties included in the accompanying consolidated income statements are as follows:Year EndedJanuary 31,February 1,February 2,in millions201520142013Minimum  rentals18182051Technology AssetsThe Company has commitments totaling approximately $135 millionto purchase primarily store technology assets and maintenance for its stores during 2015.Telecommunication ContractsThe Company has contracted for telecommunication services with agreements expiring in 2017.The total amount of these commitments is approximately $168 million.Letters of CreditThe Company is a party to threeLetter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreements providing $1100 million, $1000 million, and $200 million, respectively for letters of credit.Letters of credit under these agreements are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and approximately $1629 millionwas committed to these letters of credit at January31, 2015.As discussed in Note 5, the Company also has $1500 millionof available letters of credit included in the $7500 millionUnsecured Credit Agreement; however,as of January31, 2015, there were no letters of credit committed under this agreement.The Company also has approximately $119 millionin stand-by letters of credit that serve as collateral for its large-deductible insurance programs and expire in fiscal 2015.Surety BondsThe Company has issued various surety bonds that primarily serve as collateral for utility payments at the Companys stores.These bonds total approximately $42 millionand are committed through various dates through fiscal  Stores instituted suit in federal court in Florida alleging that the Company sold products in 48stores in violation of a lease exclusive. In August 2012, the Court denied Winn-Dixie claim for damages and granted Winn-Dixies request for injunctive relief with respect to just onestore. Winn-Dixie appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which affirmed that Winn-Dixie is not entitled to damages. However, it also held that Winn-Dixie restriction for 21of the Company Florida stores required the Company to restrict its sales of food and many household supplies such as soap, matches and paper napkins to 500square feet of floor space for fixtures containing food and many household supplies plus a portion of the surrounding aisle. The 11th Circuit remanded the case to the lower court for a new trial to determine the definition of many household supplies and how much aisle space should be included. Additional Florida leases may be impacted. The Company has previously restricted these 21stores to 500square feet of floor space for food, not including the aisle and not including many household supplies. These stores must now restrict their sales of certain household supplies further, but it is unclear how certain household products will be specifically defined and how much aisle space must be included. These issues may be decided by the trial court in the near future.In 2011, an assistant store manager and an hourly associate filed a collective action against the Company alleging they were forced to work off the clock in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA and state law. A federal judge in Virginia ruled that all claims made on behalf of assistant store managers under both the FLSA and state law should be dismissed. The court, however, certified an opt-in collective action under the FLSA on behalf of hourly sales associates. Approximately 4,300plaintiffs remain in the case. In March 2014, the court denied the Company motion to decertify the collective action and the case is now continuing.In 2012, a former assistant store manager, on behalf of himself and those alleged to be similarly situated, filed a putative class action in a California state court, alleging the Company failed to provide rest breaks to assistant store managers. The alleged time period is July 13, 2008 to the present. Discovery is ongoing. The class has been certified and the case is proceeding to the liability phase. In 2013, a former assistant store manager on behalf of himself and others alleged to be similarly aggrieved filed a representative Private Attorney General Act PAGA claim under California law currently pending in federal court in California. The suit alleges that the Company failed to provide uninterrupted meal periods and rest breaks; failed to pay minimum, regular and overtime wages; failed to maintain accurate time records and wage statements; and failed to pay wages due upon termination of employment. Discovery has not commenced.  A trial date has been set for October 26, 2015.In May 2014, a former assistant store manager filed a putative class action in a California state court for alleged failure to provide meal periods, overtime, timely payment of wages during employment and upon termination, failure to provide accurate wage statements, as well as for alleged failure to indemnify employees for business expenses in violation of California labor laws. This matter is in early stages of litigation.  Discovery has not commenced and no trial date has been set52In September 2013, district attorneys in California initiated an investigation of whether the Company properly disposed of certain damaged retail products under Federal and California state environmental law, primarily the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The Company is in the process of settling this matter and has fully accrued its estimated loss which is immaterial.In May 2014, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission CPSC began a staff investigation of circumstances related to Letters of Advice that the Company received from the CPSC from 2009 to 2013. The CPSC is now investigating Letters of Advice the Company received in 2014 and 2015. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.In July and August 2014, several shareholders of Family Dollar Stores, Inc. Family Dollar filed class actions, now consolidated into one class action, in Delaware chancery court against Family Dollars CEO and board members alleging breach of fiduciary duty. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar were also named as defendants for allegedly aiding and abetting the other defendants. The claimed breach derives from the execution of the merger agreement dated July 27, 2014, between Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, which is alleged to offer unfair and inadequate consideration for Family Dollar stock. The class action, among other things, seek to prevent the merger, obtain higher merger consideration or seek monetary damages. The Delaware Chancery Court and appellate court refused to issue an injunction against the Family Dollar shareholder vote in favor of the merger.The Company will vigorously defend itself in these matters. The Company does not believe that any of these matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on its business or financial condition. The Company cannot give assurance, however, that one or more of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on its results of operations for the period in which they are resolved. Based on the information available to the Company, including the amount of time remaining before trial, the results of discovery and the judgment of internal and external counsel, the Company is unable to express an opinion as to the outcome of these matters and cannot estimate a potential range of loss except as specified above.ResolvedA supermarket filed a lease exclusive case and a second companion unfair competition case against the Company in a Pennsylvania state court. These two cases were settled in fiscal 2014 for immaterial amounts.A supermarket filed a lease exclusive caseagainst the Company in Pennsylvania state court. This case was settled for an immaterial amount in fiscal 2014.In 2012, twoformer store managers, under California Labor Code and PAGA, instituted suit in the federal court in California on behalf of themselves and others alleged to be similarly aggrieved in the state of California, alleging they were misclassified by the Company as exempt employees. The Company settled with oneplaintiff for an immaterial amount. The Company prevailed at trial in November 2013 with the other plaintiff. A final Order has been entered in favor of the Company and the Plaintiff waived his right to appeal53NOTE 5 - LONG-TERM DEBTLong-term debt at January31, 2015and February1, 2014consists of the following:January 31,February 1,in millions20152014$7500 million Senior Notes,$7500$7500fixed interest rates payable semi-annually, January 15 and July 15$7500 million Unsecured Credit Agreement,interest payable monthly at LIBOR,plus 090%, which was 107% atJanuary 31, 2015 Demand Revenue Bonds, repaid March 2014128$70 million Forgivable Promissory Note, interest payablebeginning in November 2017 at a rate of 1%,principal payable beginning November 20177070Total long-term debt$7570$7698Less current portion128Long-term debt, excluding current portion$7570$7570Maturities of long-term debt are as follows: 2017- $02 million, 2018- $14 million, 2019- $14 millionand after 2019- $7540 millionSenior NotesThe Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement on September 16, 2013 with institutional accredited investors in which the Company issued and sold $7500 millionof Senior Notes the Notes in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.

Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2014. The Notes are unsecured and rank pari passu in right of repayment with the Company other senior unsecured indebtedness. The Company may prepay some or all of the Notes at any time in an amount not less than 5%of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid, at a price equal to the sum of a 100%of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and b the applicable make-whole amount. In the event of a change in control as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may be required to prepay the Notes. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. The Company used the net proceeds of the Notes to finance share repurchases. On January 20, 2015, the Company entered into the First Amendment the Notes Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement, with a majority of the noteholders party thereto. The Notes Amendment was entered into in connection with the Companys pending acquisition the Acquisition of Family Dollar Stores, Inc. Family Dollar. The Notes Amendment will, among other things, allow a newly-formed subsidiary of the Company to issue debt and hold the proceeds in escrow pending consummation of the Acquisition such debt, the Escrow Debt. Pursuant to the terms of the Notes Amendment, in certain circumstances the amount of interest due on the Notes may increase by 10%per annum. The Notes Amendment also contains certain negative covenants and other restrictions applicable during the period in which any Escrow Debt is outstanding. Unsecured Credit AgreementIn 2012, the Company entered into a five-year Unsecured Credit Agreement the Agreement which provides for a $7500 millionrevolving line of credit, including up to $1500 millionin available letters of credit.The interest rate on the facility is based, at the Companys option, on a LIBOR rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin.The revolving line of credit also bears a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly.The Agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness.On September 16, 2013, the Company amended the Agreement to enable the issuance of the Notes. 54On August 15, 2014, the Company entered into an amendment the Credit Amendment to the Agreement. The Credit Amendment further amends the Agreement to facilitate the issuance and/or borrowings of certain third-party debt financing that may be used by the Company to finance the Acquisition. The Credit Amendment also facilitates escrow arrangements related to the Acquisition. Demand Revenue BondsIn 1998, the Company entered into an unsecured Loan Agreement with the Mississippi Business Finance Corporation MBFC under which the MBFC issued Taxable Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds the Bonds in an aggregate principal amount of $190 millionto finance the acquisition, construction, and installation of land, buildings, machinery and equipment for the Company distribution facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi.The Bonds did not contain a prepayment penalty as long as the interest rate remained variable.The Bonds contained a demand provision and, therefore, were classified as current liabilities. On March 3, 2014, the Company repaid the $128 millionoutstanding under the Demand Revenue Bonds and the debt was retired. Forgivable Promissory NoteIn 2012, the Company entered into a promissory note with the state of Connecticut under which the state loaned the Company $70 millionin connection with the Company acquisition, construction and installation of land, building, machinery and equipment for the Company distribution facility in Windsor, Connecticut. If certain performance targets are met, the loan and any accrued interest will be forgiven in fiscal 2017. If the performance targets are not met, the loan and accrued interest must be repaid over a five-year period beginning in fiscal 2017.NOTE 6 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSHedging DerivativesIn order to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in diesel fuel costs, the Company entered into fuel derivative contracts with third parties.The Company hedged 16 million, 28 millionand 48 milliongallons of diesel fuel in 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively.These hedges represented approximately 10%, 20%and 35%of the total domestic truckload fuel needs in 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively.The Company currently has fuel derivative contracts to hedge 66 milliongallons of diesel fuel, or approximately 40%of the Company domestic truckload fuel needs from February 2015 through January 2016. Under these contracts, the Company pays the third party a fixed price for diesel fuel and receives variable diesel fuel prices at amounts approximating current diesel fuel costs, thereby creating the economic equivalent of a fixed-rate obligation.These derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore all changes in fair value for these derivatives are included under Other income expense, net on the accompanying consolidated income statements.The fair value of these contracts at January31, 2015was a liability of $57 million.

One agreement was collared and the other was uncollared. The number of shares to be received by the Company under the collared agreement was determined based on the weighted average market price of the Companys common stock, less a discount, during a calculation period ending on or before June 2014, subject to a minimum and maximum number of shares.Under this agreement, the Company received 78 millionshares during the year ended February 1, 2014. This represents the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the cap or high-end of the price range of the collar. On May 15, 2014 the collared agreement concluded and the Company received an additional 12 millionshares resulting in a total of 90 millionshares repurchased under this agreement. The number of shares to be received by the Company under the uncollared agreement was determined based on the weighted average market price of the Company common stock, less a discount, during a calculation period ending on or before June 2014. The Company received an initial delivery of 72 millionshares during the year ended February 1, 2014. On February 14, 2014 the uncollared agreement concluded and the Company received an additional 19 millionshares resulting in a total of 91 millionshares repurchased under this agreement.On November21, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement to repurchase $3000 millionof the Companys common shares under a collared Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement ASR.Under this agreement, the Company initially received 68 millionshares through December13, 2011, representing the minimum number of shares to be received based on a calculation using the cap or high-end of the price range of the collar.The ASR concluded on March28, 2012and the Company received an additional 05 millionshares under the collared agreement resulting in 73 milliontotal shares being repurchased under this ASR.

Incentive Plan EIP, the Company granted up to 180 millionshares of its Common Stock, plus any shares available for future awards under the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, to the Companys employees, including executive officers and independent contractors.The EIP permitted the Company to grant equity awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock.The exercise price of each stock option granted equaled the market price of the Companys stock at the date of grant.The options generally vested over a three-year period and have a maximum term of 10years.This plan was terminated on June16, 2011and replaced with the Companys Omnibus Incentive Plan Omnibus Plan.The Executive Officer Equity Incentive Plan EOEP was available only to the Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive officers.These officers no longer received awards under the EIP.The EOEP allowed the Company to grant the same type of equity awards as the EIP.These awards generally vested over a three-year period, with a maximum term of 10years for stock options.This plan was terminated on June16, 2011and replaced with the Omnibus Plan.Stock appreciation rights may be awarded alone or in tandem with stock options.When the stock appreciation rights are exercisable, the holder may surrender all or a portion of the unexercised stock appreciation right and receive in exchange an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value at the date of exercise over the fair market value at the date of the grant.No stock appreciation rights have been granted to date.Any restricted

of the Company common stock, or receive all or a portion of such fees in non-statutory stock options.Deferred fees that are paid out in cash will earn interest at the 30-year Treasury Bond Rate.If a director elects to be paid in common stock, the number of shares will be determined by dividing the deferred fee amount by the closing market price of a share of the Company common stock on the date of deferral.The number of options issued to a director will equal the deferred fee amount divided by 33%of the price of a share of the Company common stock.The exercise price will equal the fair market value of the Company common stock at the date the option is issued.The options are fully vested when issued and have a term of 10years.Under the Omnibus Plan, the Company may grant up to 40

The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 64of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013issued by COSO.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January31, 2015, and February1, 2014, and the related consolidated income statements, and statements of comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January31, 2015, and our report dated March 13, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements./s/ KPMG LLPNorfolk, VirginiaMarch13, 2015Item 9B.
