REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Times Mirror Company
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Times
Mirror Company as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1998. Our audits also include the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index to Financial Statements and
Financial Statement Schedule. These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Times
Mirror Company at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries as well as affiliates that are
controlled by the Company, as described in Note 4, after elimination of all
significant intercompany transactions and balances. Other affiliated companies
in which the Company owns a 20% to 50% interest are accounted for by the equity
method.
Presentation. Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the 1998 presentation. Financial
information presented in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements excludes
discontinued operations except where noted.
Changes in Accounting Principles. Effective December 31, 1998, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, Employers'
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits SFAS 132.
Pension plans and postretirement benefit information for all prior periods has
been restated to conform with the revised disclosures under SFAS 132 see Note
15.
Effective December 31, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, which establishes standards under which companies report
information about operating segments in financial statements see Note 17.
As of January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS 130. SFAS
130 requires unrealized gains or losses on the Company available-for-sale
securities, minimum pension liability adjustments and foreign currency
translation adjustments to be included in other comprehensive income. Prior year
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the requirements of
SFAS 130.
Effective December 31, 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS 128. SFAS 128
simplified the calculation of earnings per share by replacing primary and fully
diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share,
respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of investments that are
readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or
less. Cash equivalents of $997,670,000 and $9,911,000 at December 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively, consist of commercial paper, money market funds, auction
rate securities or certificates of deposit. The Company has an investment policy
for short-term investments covering eligible types of instruments, maximum
investment terms, credit quality and individual issuer limits.
Under the Company cash management system, the bank notifies the Company
daily of checks presented for payment against its primary disbursement account.
The Company transfers funds from other sources such as short-term investments or
commercial paper issuance to cover the checks presented for payment. This
program results in a book cash overdraft in the primary disbursing accounts as a
result of checks outstanding. The book overdraft, which was reclassified to
accounts payable, was $46,866,000 and $32,862,000 at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
Marketable Securities. Marketable securities consist of investments in
commercial paper with original maturities over three months but less than one
year.
Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Newsprint is valued under the last-in, first-out LIFO method and paper and
certain finished products are valued primarily under the weighted average cost
method.
Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are carried on
the basis of cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Additions, improvements and replacements are capitalized.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives as follows:
10-45 years
Machinery and  3-20 years
Leasehold  Lesser of useful life or lease term
Goodwill and Other Intangibles. Goodwill recognized in business
combinations accounted for as purchases $554,617,000 and $493,179,000 at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, net of accumulated amortization of
$131,170,000 and $160,066,000, respectively is being amortized on a
straight-line basis primarily over periods of 15 to 40 years, with a weighted
average amortization period of 36 years. Goodwill amortization expense was
$21,821,000, $19,086,000 and $18,237,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively.
Other intangibles arising in connection with acquisitions are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging
primarily from 4 to 30 years, with a weighted average life of 25 years.
Amortization expense was $13,833,000, $8,665,000 and $7,919,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Accumulated amortization
was $66,246,000 and $62,183,000 at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The Company assesses on an ongoing basis the recoverability of goodwill
based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows for the applicable business
compared to net book value. If the future undiscounted cash flows estimate were
less than net book value, net book value would then be reduced to fair value
based on an estimate of discounted cash flows. The Company also evaluates the
amortization periods of assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets,
to determine whether events or circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful
lives.
Deferred Charges. Magazine subscription procurement costs are charged to
expense over the same period as the related revenue is earned. Certain expenses
for training materials and consumer health publications are capitalized and
charged to expense over the estimated product lives as the products are sold.
Derivative Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps see Note 8 are used
to manage exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for on the accrual basis. Payments made or
received are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. Amounts received
in connection with initiating or terminating swaps are amortized on a
straight-line basis as a reduction in interest expense over the term of the
swaps.
Premium equity participating debt securities see Note 12 are used to
manage the Company exposure to market risk associated with changes in the fair
values of the Company investment in the common stock of Netscape
Communications Corporation Netscape.
The Company exposure to market risk associated with fluctuations in the
value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may be managed with
foreign currency forward contracts, currency options, currency swaps or other
risk management instruments permitted by the Company internal policy
guidelines. During 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company forward contracts and
other risk management instruments were not significant.
Commodity price hedging contracts see Note 8 are used to manage the
Company exposure to market risk associated with fluctuations in newsprint
prices. These contracts are accounted for on the accrual basis. Periodic
settlement payments made or received are recognized as an adjustment to the cost
basis of newsprint inventory. Amounts paid in connection with initiating these
contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis as an adjustment to the cost
basis of newsprint inventory over the term of the contracts.
Put options are used in conjunction with the Company common stock
purchase program. These contracts are entered into based on market conditions as
well as other factors. The costs or benefits derived

equity on the date of the transaction. The potential obligation under these put
options outstanding at December 31, 1998 and 1997 has been transferred from
shareholders' equity to Common stock subject to put options.
Revenue Recognition. Revenues from certain products sold with the right of
return, are recognized net of a provision for estimated returns. Revenues from
newspaper and magazine subscriptions and professional service fee annual
subscriptions are deferred as unearned income at the time of the sale. A pro
rata share of the newspaper and magazine subscription price is included in
revenue as products are delivered to subscribers. Professional service fee
annual subscription revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
life of the subscription service.
Advertising and Promotion Costs. Advertising and promotion costs, which are
expensed as incurred, amounted to $69,725,000, $73,578,000 and $74,487,000 for
the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

NOTE 2 -- RECAPITALIZATION
During the third quarter of 1997, the Company completed a transaction
Transaction involving agreements with its largest shareholders, Chandler Trust
No. 1 and Chandler Trust No. 2 Chandler Trusts. The Transaction consisted of
two components: a the merger of Chandis Securities Company Chandis, a
holding company owned by Chandler Trust No. 2 and affiliated minority investors,
into Chandis Acquisition Corporation CAC, a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Merger and b the formation of a new
limited liability company by the Chandler Trusts and the Company.
On August 8, 1997, Chandis merged with and into CAC. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, the Chandis shareholders received 6,582,000 shares of Series A common
stock, 9,656,000 shares of Series C common stock, 381,000 shares of new Series
C-1 preferred stock, and 245,000 shares of new Series C-2 preferred stock. At
the time of the Merger, Chandis owned 8,582,000 shares of Series A common stock,
9,656,000 shares of Series C common stock, and 381,000 shares of Series A
preferred stock as well as an interest in undeveloped real estate and certain
other assets and liabilities. CAC is not a permitted transferee as defined in
the Company Certificate of Incorporation, therefore, the Series C common stock
was converted to Series A common stock as a result of the Merger. The Company
shares owned by CAC are reported as treasury stock for financial reporting
purposes. The Merger was a tax-free transaction.
Concurrent with the consummation of the Merger, the Company including
certain of its subsidiaries and the Chandler Trusts formed TMCT, LLC TMCT, a
Delaware limited liability company, and the following capital contributions were
made to TMCT:
1. the Company contributed $249,266,000 in cash and 8 real properties
Real Properties with an aggregate market value of $225,850,000;
42
44
TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. the Chandler Trusts contributed 5,001,000 shares of Series A common
stock and 443,000 shares of Series A preferred stock Contributed
Shares.
The cash contributed by the Company was used by TMCT to purchase a
portfolio of securities Portfolio. The Company has leased the Real Properties
from TMCT under a lease with minimum lease payments equal to the fair values and
with an initial term of 12 years. During 1998 and 1997, the Company made lease
payments to TMCT of $24,166,000 and $9,599,000. The lease is accounted for as a
financing arrangement and, accordingly, the Real Properties' book value remains
on the Company consolidated balance sheet and continues to be depreciated at
the rates in effect prior to the contribution of the Real Properties to TMCT.
The depreciation, along with a reduction of property, plant and equipment of
$168,021,000, which represents the estimated net book value of the Real
Properties at the end of the lease term, will result in a net book value of zero
for the Real Properties at August 8, 2009. At that time, the Company has the
option to purchase all the Real Properties for their fair market value. If the
Real Properties are not purchased by the Company, they will remain the assets of
TMCT and may be leased by the Company at a fair value rent as provided for under
the terms of the lease agreement. The lease provides for two additional 12-year
lease terms with fair value purchase options at the end of each lease term. The
lease is included as a property financing in the Company outstanding debt
obligations see Note 12.
The Company and the Chandler Trusts share in the cash flow, profits and
losses of the various assets held by TMCT. The cash flow from the Real
Properties and the Portfolio is largely allocated to the Chandler Trusts and the
cash flow from the Contributed Shares is largely allocated to the Company. Due
to the allocations of the economic benefits in the TMCT, 80% of the Contributed
Shares are included in treasury stock for financial reporting purposes and 80%
of the preferred dividends on the Series A preferred stock are excluded from the
preferred dividend requirements. The Company accounts for the investment in TMCT
under the equity method. This net investment was $96,416,000 and $95,487,000 at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and is included in Equity
investments in the consolidated balance sheets. During 1998 and 1997, the
Company recognized $3,739,000 and $1,268,000 of equity income on this
investment.
As a result of the Transaction, for financial reporting purposes and
earnings per share calculations, the number of shares of Series A common stock
outstanding was reduced by 6,001,000, the number of shares of Series A preferred
stock outstanding was reduced by 735,000 and the annual preferred dividend
requirements were reduced to $21,697,000 beginning in 1998. Preferred dividend
requirements for 1997 were reduced by $3,168,000.
NOTE 3 -- DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
During the second quarter of 1998, the Company reached agreements to divest
Matthew Bender & Company, Incorporated Matthew Bender, the Company legal
publisher, in a tax-free reorganization see Note 4 and its 50% ownership
interest in legal citation provider Shepard. The two transactions were valued
at $1,649,650,000 in the aggregate and were completed in the third quarter of
1998. The disposition of the Company 50% interest in Shepard was consummated
by a transfer of the respective partnership interests owned by two subsidiaries
of the Company to affiliates of Reed Elsevier plc for a cash consideration of
$274,650,000. The Company recorded a net gain on these two transactions in the
amount of $1,108,452,000, net of expenses and $163,585,000 of income taxes,
primarily consisting of tax reserves as disclosed in Note 11. Also during the
second quarter of 1998, the Company reached agreements to divest Mosby, Inc.
Mosby, the Company health science/medical publisher, in a tax-free
reorganization see Note 4. The transaction was valued at $415,000,000 and was
completed in the fourth quarter of 1998. The Company recorded a net gain on this
transaction in the amount of $239,023,000, net of expenses and $55,635,000 of
income taxes, primarily consisting of tax reserves as disclosed in Note 11.
While the Company believes that the Matthew Bender and Mosby transactions were
completed on a tax-free basis, this position may be subject to review by the
Internal Revenue Service.

the merger. As a result of the merger, the Company received all of the issued
and outstanding common stock of Mosby Parent Corp. Mosby Parent. Mosby Parent
is also the sole member of Eagle Publishing Investments, LLC Eagle Publishing.
An affiliate of Harcourt General, Inc. owns voting preferred stock of Mosby
Parent with a stated value of $50,000,000 which affords it voting control over
Mosby Parent, subject to certain rights held by the Company with respect to
Eagle Publishing. Concurrently with the closing of the merger, the Company
became the sole manager of Eagle Publishing and controls its operations and
assets. At December 31, 1998, the assets of Eagle Publishing were $377,152,000
of cash and cash equivalents, $34,486,000 of marketable securities and
$20,129,000 of other assets. The consolidated financial statements of the
Company include the accounts of Eagle Publishing.
The Company intends to deploy the assets of both LLCs to finance
acquisitions and investments, including purchases of the Company common stock,
and does not intend to use those funds for the Company general working capital
purposes.
NOTE 5 -- ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND WRITEDOWNS
On April 30, 1998, the Company acquired the Los Angeles area business of EZ
Buy & EZ Sell Recycler Corporation Recycler, consisting primarily of the
Recycler publications in the Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and
Ventura counties and a portion of Santa Barbara county for $188,696,000. This
acquisition resulted in goodwill of $119,242,000 and other intangible assets of
$69,430,000, which are being amortized primarily over 30 years. The Company also
invested in preferred stock and provided a term loan to Target Media Partners, a
new entity which owns all of the non-Los Angeles area assets of Recycler, for a
total amount of $34,800,000. The Company also had several other small
acquisitions during 1998. Goodwill of $13,994,000 related to these small
acquisitions is being amortized primarily over 15 years.
During the third and fourth quarters of 1997, the Company acquired Krames
Communications Incorporated, a publisher of consumer-oriented health education
information; Patuxent Publishing Company, a publisher of 13 community weeklies
in Maryland and This Week Publications, Inc., a free weekly shopper distributed
in Queens and Long Island, New York. These and several other small acquisitions
resulted in goodwill of $75,319,000, which is being amortized over periods of 15
to 30 years. During 1996, the Company had several small acquisitions which
resulted in goodwill of $11,419,000, which is being amortized over periods of 8
to 15 years.
These acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method with the
results of operations included in the Company financial statements from the
dates of acquisition. Pro forma results for 1998 and 1997, assuming these
acquisitions occurred on January 1 of the respective year, are not materially
different from the results reported.
During 1998, the Company sold 441,900 shares of its holdings in Netscape
common stock and purchased an equal proportion of its 4 1/4% Premium Equity
Participating Securities PEPS obligation in the open market. The PEPS hedge
the Company investment in Netscape. The sales resulted in a gain of
$16,025,000 or $9,495,000 after applicable income taxes. Also, the Company
disposed of various excess real estate and other assets for an aggregate gain of
$16,110,000 or $9,554,000 after applicable income taxes. The total aggregate
gain of $32,135,000 is included in Other, net in the consolidated statements
of income.
During 1997, the Company sold certain equity investments, including Tejon
Ranch Co.; WebTV Network, Inc.; Netscape Communications Corporation; Access
Health, Inc.; Speedvision Network, LLC and Outdoor Life Network, LLC, for an
aggregate gain of $81,984,000 or $53,759,000 after applicable income taxes. This
gain was offset by $78,272,000, or $48,417,000 after applicable income taxes,

$3,712,000 is included in Other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
NOTE 6 -- RESTRUCTURING, ONE-TIME AND OTHER CHARGES
1998 Restructuring Charges. In 1998, the Company undertook a comprehensive
review of its business operations to determine areas where operational
efficiencies could be achieved through either product and/or facility
consolidation, headcount reductions, product abandonments, contract terminations
or through other measures. The Company began this review in anticipation of the
impact of its significant 1998 divestitures and to better align its overall cost
structure and business configurations. The Company review led to a major
restructuring program that resulted in the recording of $39,697,000, $80,012,000
and $81,097,000 of charges in the second, third and fourth quarters of 1998,
respectively. A summary of the significant components of the 1998 restructuring
program is as follows in thousands:

$102,505    $53,299    $29,072    $15,930   $200,806
A discussion of the specific restructuring activities follows:
Termination benefits. Staff reductions were implemented at substantially
all operating units with the majority of these actions performed within the
Newspaper Publishing segment. The Los Angeles Times recorded severance charges
related to 358 full-time and 534 part-time employees through either voluntary or
involuntary programs, primarily occurring in the fourth quarter of 1998. The
Baltimore Sun termination charges included 81 full-time employees and Newsday
determined that 23 full-time and 26 part-time employees would be released. The
staff reductions within the Newspaper Publishing segment were the result of
identified efficiencies from outsourcing opportunities, elimination of duplicate
functions and technological improvements to the Company processes. In total,
termination benefits, which were largely severance costs, covered 616 full-time
and 578 part-time employees company-wide of which 224 employees had been
released by the end of 1998 with the majority of employees expected to be
released by the second quarter of 1999. As of December 31, 1998, $5,126,000 has
been paid out under this program with the remaining liability expected to be
substantially paid by the end of 1999. Certain employees will, however, receive
payments over a longer period of time.
Contract Terminations. In reviewing the Company processes, supply
contracts and strategic alliances, the Company identified certain long-term
contracts and relationships which were no longer providing benefits to the
Company current operations. As a result, the Company recorded charges for
contract terminations which included i the termination of a long-term contract
related to Newsday pre-print distribution business for $34,250,000; ii the
termination of The Hartford Courant long-standing bonus arrangement for
$12,000,000 and iii the termination of 56 distribution contracts with outside
agents at the Los Angeles Times for $4,904,000.
Goodwill Impairments. In connection with the Company divestiture of
Mosby, the Company retained the consumer health publishing businesses of Mosby
which were combined with its health information
47

provider, The StayWell Company. In reorganizing these operations and making
significant fundamental business and structural changes, revised forecasts of
undiscounted cash flows related to these enterprises were prepared which
identified that the entity may not have the estimated future cash flows
necessary to recover asset values. The Company recorded a write-off based on the
difference between the net book value of goodwill, the entity primary
long-lived asset, and the fair value, measured by discounted estimated cash
flows from future operations. In addition, an impairment charge was taken
related to goodwill associated with two of the Company magazine titles. These
charges were taken as the result of disappointing market penetration and
operating results and were also determined based on discounted estimated cash
flows from future operations. The valuation of goodwill was made in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
Lease Termination Costs. In connection with the Company consolidation of
its training companies under one entity, AchieveGlobal, and its downsizing
and/or relocation of other operating units, the Company has recorded charges for
future operating lease payments and write-offs of leasehold improvements related
to facilities it will vacate. The total lease payment accrual for periods
through 2010 is net of estimated sublease income of $5,786,000. No amounts have
been included for any period in which the operating units will continue to
occupy the premises.
Technology Asset Write-offs. During mid-1998, the Company determined that
its long standing policy of allowing each operating unit to independently
determine its technology requirements and make related equipment and software
purchases was both inefficient as well as expensive in terms of maintenance,
helpdesk, networking and other support costs. In connection with this decision,
the Company established common hardware and software configurations to provide
consistency across all business units. As a result, many operating units were
required to dispose of a significant amount of technology resources to conform
to the common platform. Total asset write-offs of technology-related equipment
were taken in the quarter in which the equipment was replaced.
Business Exit and Other Costs. In performing a detailed review of its
business and related product offerings, AchieveGlobal recorded a $8,547,000
charge to reflect the termination of its direct sales business line due to poor
financial results and to record an estimated loss on the sale of its Canadian
operations. Charges taken for the direct sales business were primarily for asset
write-offs. The Company estimated loss related to the Canadian operations uses
an estimate of proceeds based on recent sales transactions of its other foreign
entities. The estimated loss includes both the basis of the assets to be sold as
well as costs required to sell the enterprise and a change to a franchise
arrangement. Management anticipates that the franchising of these operations
will be completed by the second quarter of 1999. The revenues and operating
profits from those businesses that the Company plans to exit are not significant
to total operations. Other costs were recognized at Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. for
the abandonment of certain projects and at The StayWell Company for the
consolidation of processes.
Other Program Charges. In addition to the charges listed above, the Company
also recorded $32,685,000 for certain asset write-offs that did not meet the
accounting criteria for classification as restructuring and one-time charges.
These charges, which principally included inventory and other operating asset
write-offs have been classified within Cost of sales, Selling, general and
administrative expenses or Other, net in the consolidated statements of
income.
1996 Restructuring Charges. The 1996 restructuring charges totaled
$17,348,000 for efforts undertaken at AchieveGlobal to integrate the training
companies. As of December 31, 1998, these efforts were substantially complete.

The current portion of restructuring liabilities relates primarily to
severance and contract termination payments while the non-current portion
principally relates to lease payments which will be paid over lease periods
extending to 2005. The Company made severance payments under all programs which
totaled $8,532,000, $6,228,000 and $40,886,000 during 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. At December 31, 1998, the remaining liability for severance costs
aggregated $53,831,000.
The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its remaining
restructuring liabilities and makes adjustments if required. During 1998 and
1997, these adjustments resulted in recoveries of prior year restructuring
reserves which were largely offset by restructuring requirements in those years.
The net change in the restructuring liabilities as a result of these reviews was
not significant.

Unrealized net gain on interest rate
--    43,246     --   27,583
Short-Term Assets and Liabilities. The fair values of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
short-term debt approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature
of these financial instruments.
Long-Term Investments. Investments are primarily stated at fair value based
on quoted market prices and are classified as available-for-sale securities. The
investments are included in Investments and other assets in the consolidated
balance sheets. The cost of the investments was $55,764,000 and $18,865,000 at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The unrealized gain is included in
accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of
shareholders' equity, net of applicable income taxes.
Notes Receivable. The carrying value of notes receivable is estimated to
approximate fair values. Although there are no quoted market prices available
for these instruments, the fair value estimates were based on the change in
interest rates and risk related interest rate spreads since the notes
origination date.
Long-Term Debt. The fair value of long-term debt is based primarily on the
Company current refinancing rates for publicly issued fixed rate debt with
comparable maturities, except for the PEPS securities whose fair value is the
current maturity value determined by a formula based on quoted market prices of
the underlying common stock whose market risk it modifies.
Interest Rate Swaps. Interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December
31, 1998 were for notional amounts of $148,000,000, $250,000,000, $170,111,000
and $100,000,000 expiring in 1999, 1999, 2002 and 2023, respectively, with the
$170,111,000 and $100,000,000 notional amounts also outstanding at Decem-
50

TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
ber 31, 1997. These swaps effectively convert a portion of the Company
long-term fixed rate debt to a variable rate obligation based on LIBOR or the
Commercial Paper rate. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are the
amounts at which they could be settled based on estimates of market rates.
Commodity Hedging Contracts. The Company enters into various commodity
hedging contracts to manage the Company exposures to fluctuations in newsprint
prices. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had newsprint swap agreements for a
total notional amount of 261,000 metric tons per year expiring in 2002 and 2003
at a weighted average contract price of $609 per metric ton. Also, the Company
has a newsprint option contract for a total notional amount of 30,000 metric
tons per year expiring in 2001 at a contract price of $585 per metric ton. At
December 31, 1998, the index rate used for these contracts was $585 per metric
ton. This option contract limits the maximum payment to $115 per metric ton
above the contract price on an annual basis. In addition to the newsprint
hedging contracts, the Company has a swap contract for coated paper used in its
Magazine Publishing activities for a total notional amount of 5,000 short tons
per year expiring in 2000 at a contract price of $1,047 per short ton. As no
liquid forward market for newsprint or coated paper exists, it was not
practicable to estimate the fair value of the commodity hedging contracts.
New Accounting Pronouncement. In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, which
the Company is required to adopt effective January 1, 2000. SFAS 133 will
require the Company to record all derivatives as assets or liabilities at fair
value. Changes in derivative fair values will either be recognized in earnings,
offset against changes in the fair value of the related hedged assets,
liabilities and firm commitments or, for forecasted transactions, recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity until the hedged
transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a
hedging derivative change in fair value will be recognized in earnings
immediately. The impact of SFAS 133 on the Company financial statements will
depend on a variety of factors, including, the extent of the Company hedging
activities, the types of hedging instruments used and the effectiveness of such
instruments. The Company expects to adopt SFAS 133 as of January 1, 2000. The
effect of adopting the Statement is currently being evaluated, however, the
Company does not believe the effects of adoption will be material to its
financial position or results of operations.

Debentures, the 7 1/2% Debentures and the Liquid Yield Option Notes LYONS from
632% to 562% for the year ended December 31, 1998.
In September 1997, the Company issued $250,000,000 of 661% Debentures due
September 15, 2027 Debentures with interest payable semiannually commencing
March 15, 1998. The Debentures are redeemable at the option of the Company, in
whole or in part, at any time after September 15, 2004 at a redemption price
equal to the greater of a 100% of the principal amount or b the sum of the
present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest
discounted to the redemption date. The Debentures may be put to the Company on
September 15, 2004 at 100% of face value plus accrued interest.
In April 1997, the Company received gross proceeds of $195,530,000 from the
issuance of the LYONs. The LYONs are zero coupon subordinated notes with an
aggregate face value of $500,000,000 and a yield to maturity of 475%. Each LYON
has a $1,000 face value and is convertible at the option of the holder any time
prior to maturity. If conversion is elected, the Company will, at its option,
deliver a 5828 shares of Series A common stock per each LYON or b cash
equal to the market value of such shares. On or after April 15, 2002, the LYONs
may be redeemed at any time by the Company for cash equal to the issuance price
plus accrued original discount through the date of redemption. In addition, each
LYON may be redeemed for cash
54
56
TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
at the option of the holder on April 15, 2002, 2007 or 2012. The cash payable
for each LYON at these redemption dates is approximately $495, $625 and $791,
respectively, which is equal to the issuance price plus accrued original
discount through the date of redemption. The Company has an interest rate swap
agreement for a notional amount of $170,111,000, expiring April 15, 2002, to
exchange a fixed interest rate of 475% for a variable rate based on six-month
LIBOR less 2458%.
The 4 1/4% PEPS hedge the Company investment in the common stock of
Netscape. The amount payable at maturity is determined by reference to the fair
market value of the Netscape common stock. As a result, the maturity value will
generally move in tandem with changes in the fair market value of Netscape
stock. Changes in the current maturity value of the PEPS are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. At
December 31, 1998 and 1997, the fair market value of Netscape common stock was
$6075 and $24375 per share, respectively. The PEPS are redeemable at the
option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time after December 15, 2000.
The redemption price is based on the market value of the Netscape common stock
adjusted in accordance with a predetermined formula which allocates a portion of
the appreciation, if any, to the Company. During 1998, the Company sold 441,900
shares of Netscape stock and purchased an equal proportion of its PEPS in the
open market see Note 5.
The Company has an agreement with several domestic and foreign banks for
unsecured long-term revolving lines of credit that expire in September 2000.
This agreement provides for borrowings up to $400,000,000 at interest rates
based on, at the Company option, the banks' base rates, Eurodollar rates or
competitive bid rates. The commitment fee is approximately 0065% per annum. The
lines of credit are used to support a commercial paper program. The Company
revolving lines of credit contain restrictive provisions relating primarily to
interest expense coverage. The Company earnings before interest expense,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization, divided by interest expense, must
be greater than or equal to 50. The weighted average interest rates and
weighted average commercial paper borrowings were 53% and 56% and $243,095,000
and $72,561,000 during 1998 and 1997, respectively.
At December 31, 1998, the Company had an uncommitted bank line of credit
which provides for unsecured borrowings up to $250,000,000 of which there were
no amounts outstanding. In February 1999, the Company borrowed $60,000,000 under
this line of credit.
The Company has $20,820,000 of undrawn standby letters of credit at
December 31, 1998.

NOTE 13 -- CAPITAL STOCK AND STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM
Preferred Stocks. Series A, Series C-1 and Series C-2 preferred stocks are
cumulative, non-voting stocks with annual dividends of 8%, 58% and 58 respectively, based on liquidation value. Series A was entitled to dividends
effective March 1, 1995. Dividends on Series C-1 and Series C-2 may increase
commencing in 2001 to a maximum annual dividend of 84%, based on the percentage
increases, if any, in the dividends paid by the Company on its common stock.
Series A, Series C-1 and Series C-2 are convertible into Series A common stock
in 2025 at the earliest. The conversion factor is calculated by dividing $500
plus accrued and unpaid
55

dividends by the average closing prices of Series A common stock for the 20
trading days immediately preceding the conversion date. The maximum number of
shares of Series A common stock into which Series C-2 can be converted is
limited to 2,957,000 shares.
On February 28, 1997, the Series B preferred stock was called for
redemption and was redeemed on April 2, 1997 for 4,446,000 shares of Series A
common stock. The conversion ratio, determined pursuant to the original terms of
the Series B, was 57083 of a share of Series A common stock. At the redemption
date, the Company had forward purchase contracts for 3,900,000 shares of Series
B preferred stock with a weighted average forward price of $28475 per share.
These contracts provided for early termination and, in May 1997, the termination
of the contract resulted in the purchase by the Company of 2,226,000 shares of
Series A common stock for an aggregate cost of $111,530,000.
Preferred stock is issuable in series under such terms and conditions as
the Board of Directors may determine.
Common Stocks. Shares of Series A and Series C common stock are identical,
except with respect to voting rights, restrictions on transfer of Series C
shares and the right to convert Series C shares into Series A shares. Series A
shares are entitled to one vote per share and Series C shares are entitled to
ten votes per share. Series C shares are subject to mandatory conversion into
Series A shares upon transfer to any person other than a Permitted Transferee
as defined in the Company Certificate of Incorporation or upon the occurrence
of certain regulatory events. Series B common stock is entitled to one-tenth
vote per share and is available for common stock issuance transactions, such as
underwritten public offerings and acquisitions.
Cash dividends of $72 and $55 per share of common stock were declared for
the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. In February 1999, the
Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on its common
stock to $20 per share, from $18 per share, beginning with the March 10, 1999
payment date.
Treasury Stock. Treasury stock includes shares of Series A common stock and
Series A preferred stock owned by affiliates as well as Series A common stock
purchased by the Company as part of the stock purchase program. Approximately
13,262,000, 4,001,000 and 18,238,000 shares of Series A common stock included in
treasury stock are owned by Eagle New Media, TMCT and CAC, respectively, and
$177,039,000 and $192,023,000 stated value of Series A preferred stock, which
are owned by TMCT and CAC, respectively, are included in treasury stock at
December 31, 1998.
Stock Purchases. During 1998, the Company and Eagle New Media purchased
16,355,000 common shares for a total cost of $947,203,000. An additional 350,000
common shares were purchased for $17,472,000, net of premiums received, as a
result of the exercise of put options. At December 31, 1998, the Company had
400,000 put options outstanding with a weighted average strike price of $5640
per common share. The cash received from the issuance of put options during 1998
and 1997 was not significant. The put options entitle the holder to sell shares
of Times Mirror Series A common stock to the Company at the strike price on the
expiration date of the put option. The unexpired put options are at strike
prices ranging from $5581 to $5800. These put options expire on various dates
through April 1999.
Included in the 1998 share purchases were 4,000,000 shares that were
purchased in the fourth quarter of 1998 as part of an accelerated purchase
agreement. The shares were purchased at the closing price on the date of the
agreement for $5469 per share. The agreement provides for a purchase price
adjustment based on a pro-rata settlement over a one-year period. The agreement,
which is due to mature in the fourth quarter of 1999, provides for settlement of
the purchase price adjustment on a net share basis.
In August 1998, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to
acquire 1,000,000 shares of Series A common stock. The Company settled this
agreement in February 1999 at a price of $6335 per share in cash.

TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
During 1997, the Company purchased 8,882,000 shares of Series A common
stock for a total cost of $464,781,000. An additional 120,000 shares of Series A
common stock were purchased for $3,719,000, net of premiums received, as a
result of the exercise of put options.
In connection with the Company ongoing stock purchase program, in October
1998, the Company Board of Directors authorized the purchase over the next two
years of an additional 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The aggregate remaining
shares authorized for purchase at December 31, 1998 was approximately 1,100,000
shares. The Company believes that the purchase of shares of its common stock is
an attractive investment for Eagle New Media which will enhance Times Mirror
shareholder value as well as to offset dilution from shares of common stock
issued under the Company stock-based employee compensation and benefit
program. In February 1999, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an
additional amount of up to 6,000,000 shares of its Series A common stock.
NOTE 14 -- STOCK OPTION AND AWARD PLANS
The Company has various stock option plans under which options may be
granted to purchase shares of Series A common stock at a price equal to the fair
market value at the date of grant. Options that are not exercised expire ten
years from the date of grant. Options granted to key employees generally vest
over a four-year period. Grants made under a broad-based stock option plan, for
employees not eligible for other stock option grants, are fully vested three
years after the date of grant. Restricted stock is also awarded to key
employees. The number of restricted stock awards, including matching awards in
connection with the annual incentive bonus program, is not material.

If the Company recognized employee stock option-related compensation
expense in accordance with SFAS 123 and used the Black-Scholes option valuation
model for determining the weighted average fair value of options granted after
December 31, 1994, its net income and earnings per share would have been as
follows in thousands except per share amounts:
1998     1997    1996
Net income -- as  $1,417,338  $250,312  $206,444
Pro forma stock compensation expense, net.   18,709  13,000   4,959
Pro forma net  $1,398,629  $237,312  $201,485
Pro forma basic earnings per share. $  1586  $  218  $  154
Pro forma diluted earnings per share. $  1548  $  211  $  149
For purposes of the pro forma expense, the weighted average fair value of
the options is amortized over the vesting period. The pro forma effect on net
income for 1996 through 1998 may not be representative of future years' impact
because options granted prior to 1995 are excluded from the pro forma
calculations. Options are granted every year and the pro forma expense in future
years will grow due to the added layers of amortization for succeeding grants.
By 1999, however, the pro forma results will include a full four years' worth of
option grants.
The weighted average fair value of stock options on the date of grant, and
the assumptions used to estimate the fair value using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model, were as follows:
1998    1997    1996
Weighted average fair value of stock options
$ 1278  $ 1190  $  887
Risk-free interest     55%    62%    54%

Expected     20     22     26
Expected dividend    233%    233%    200 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options. The Company employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options such as vesting restrictions and lack of transferability. In addition,
the assumptions used in option valuation models are highly subjective,
particularly with respect to the expected stock price volatility for the
underlying stock. Because changes in these subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair
58

TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
NOTE 15 -- PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company has defined benefit pension plans and various other
contributory and noncontributory retirement plans covering substantially all
employees. In general, benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on
years of service and the employee compensation during the last five years of
employment. The majority of the Company employees are covered by one defined
benefit plan. Funding for this plan is not expected to be required in the near
future as the plan is overfunded.
Postretirement health care benefits provided by the Company are unfunded
and cover certain employees hired before January 1, 1993. The various plans have
significantly different provisions for lifetime maximums, retiree cost-sharing,
health care providers, prescription drug coverage and other benefits.
Postretirement life insurance benefits are generally insured by life insurance
policies and cover employees who retired on or before December 31, 1993. Life
insurance benefits vary by plan, ranging from $1,000 to $250,000. Certain
employees become eligible for the postretirement health care benefits if they
meet minimum age and service requirements and retire from full-time, active
service.

liabilities. A change of 1% in the health care cost trend rate would have the
following effects in thousands:

defined benefit plan. The fair value of the ESOP assets was $264,715,000 and
$307,188,000 as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. At December 31,
1998, the ESOP held 3,148,000 shares of Series A common stock, and 1,507,000
shares of Series C common stock. The final contribution to the ESOP was in 1994
and the ESOP has been amended to discontinue contributions by the Company. There
are no unallocated shares in the ESOP at December 31, 1998.
Substantially all employees over age 21 with one year of service are
eligible to participate in the Company Savings Plus Plan. Eligible employees
may contribute from 1% to 15% of their basic compensation. The Company makes
matching contributions equal to 50% of employee before-tax contributions from 1%
to 6%. Employees may choose among eight investment options, including a Company
common stock fund, for investing their contributions and the Company matching
contribution. Defined contribution plan expense, primarily related to the
Savings Plus Plan, was $16,665,000, $19,151,000, and $16,867,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

NOTE 18 -- USE OF ESTIMATES AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES
Financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles require management to make estimates and judgments that
affect amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates, although management does not believe
that any differences would materially affect the Company financial position or
reported results.
The Company future results could be adversely affected by a number of
factors, including a an increase in paper, printing and distribution costs
over the levels anticipated; b increased consolidation among major retailers
or other events depressing the level of display advertising; c an economic
downturn in the Company principal newspaper markets or other occurrences
leading to decreased circulation and diminished revenues from both display and
classified advertising; d an increase in the use of alternate media such as
the Internet for classified and other advertising; e an increase in expenses
related to new initiatives and product improvement efforts in the flight
information and health information operating units; f unfavorable foreign
currency fluctuations; and g a general economic downturn resulting in
decreased professional or corporate spending on discretionary items such as
information or training and in decreased consumer spending on discretionary
items such as magazines or newspapers.
