BusinessMercury Systems, Inc. the Company or Mercury is a leading high-tech commercial provider of more affordable secure and sensor processing subsystems designed and made in the U.S.A. powering today critical defense and intelligence applications. The Company delivers innovative solutions, rapid time-to-value and service and support to its defense prime contractor customers. The Company products and solutions have been deployed in more than 300programs with over 25different defense prime contractors. Key programs include Aegis, Patriot, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program SEWIP, Gorgon Stare, Predator, F-35 and Reaper. The Company organizational structure allows it to deliver capabilities that combine technology building blocks and deep domain expertise in the defense sector.The Company goal is to grow and build on its position as a critical component of the defense industrial base and become the leading provider of open and more affordable secure and sensor processing subsystems. The Mercury Commercial Electronics MCE operating segment designs, develops and builds open sensor processing products and subsystems that include embedded processing modules and subsystems, radio frequency RF and microwave multi-function assemblies as well as subsystems, and RF and microwave components. The Mercury Defense Systems MDS operating segment provides significant capabilities relating to pre-integrated, open, more affordable electronic warfare EW, electronic attack EA and electronic counter measure ECM subsystems and significant capabilities in signals intelligence SIGINT, and electro-optical/infrared EO/IR processing technologies and radar environment test and simulation systems. In June 2014, the Company initiated a plan to divest the Mercury Intelligence Systems MIS operating segment, based on the Company strategic direction and investment priorities focusing on its core business. As a result, the Company MIS operating segment met the held for sale criteria in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205,Presentation of Financial Statements, FASB ASC 205 as of June 30, 2014 see Note C to consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements, excluding the statements of shareholders' equity and cash flows, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements were restated for all periods presented to reflect the discontinuation of the MIS operating segment, in accordance with FASB ASC 205. On January 23, 2015, the Company completed the sale of the MIS operating segment.B.Summary of Significant Accounting  consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. BUSINESSCOMBINATIONSThe Company utilizes the acquisition method of accounting under FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations,FASB ASC 805, for all transactions and events which it obtains control over one or more other businesses, to recognize the fair value of all assets and liabilities acquired, even if less than one hundred percent ownership is acquired, and in establishing the acquisition date fair value as measurement date for all assets and liabilities assumed. The Company also utilizes FASB ASC 805 for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business  preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those  Company relies upon FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition,to account for its revenue transactions. Revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, and customer acceptance criteria, if any, have been successfully demonstrated. Out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in revenue and cost of revenue50Table of ContentsCertain contracts with customers require the Company to perform tests of its products prior to shipment to ensure their performance complies with the Companys published product specifications and, on occasion, with additional customer-requested specifications. In these cases, the Company conducts such tests and, if they are completed successfully, includes a written confirmation with each order shipped. As a result, at the time of each product shipment, the Company believes that no further customer testing requirements exist and that there is no uncertainty of acceptance by its customer.The Company uses FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU No2009-13 FASB ASU 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. FASB ASU 2009-13 establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which includes: 1vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE if available; 2 third-party evidence TPE if VSOE is not available; and 3 best estimated selling price BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.Additionally, FASB ASU 2009-13 expands the disclosure requirements related to a vendors multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.The Company enters into multiple-deliverable arrangements that may include a combination of hardware components, related integration or other services. These arrangements generally do not include any performance-, cancellation-, termination- or refund-type provisions. In accordance with the provisions of FASB ASU 2009-13, the Company allocates arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price. The Company generally expects that it will not be able to establish VSOE or TPE due to limited single element transactions and the nature of the markets in which the Company competes, and, as such, the Company typically determines its relative selling price using BESP.The Company uses BESP in its allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which the Company would transact if the product or service were sold by the Company on a standalone basis.The Companys determination of BESP involves the consideration of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. Specifically, the Company considers the cost to produce the deliverable, the anticipated margin on that deliverable, the selling price and profit margin for similar parts, the Companys ongoing pricing strategy and policies as evident from the price list established and updated by management on a regular basis, the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold.The Company analyzes the selling prices used in its allocation of arrangement consideration at a minimum on an annual basis. Selling prices will be analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in the Companys business necessitates a more timely analysis or if the Company experiences significant variances in its selling prices.Each deliverable within the Companys multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting under the guidance of FASB ASU 2009-13 if both of the following criteria are met: the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis; and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the Company. The Companys revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products. The Company considers a deliverable to have standalone value if the item is sold separately by the Company or another vendor or if the item could be resold by the customer. Deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion. The appropriate allocation of arrangement consideration and recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined unit of accounting.The Company also engages in long-term contracts for development, production and services activities which it accounts for consistent with FASB ASC 605-35, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature. The Company considers the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting for a particular contract. Generally for fixed-price contracts, other than service-type contracts, revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method or, for certain short-term contracts, by the completed contract method. Revenue from service-type fixed-price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate input or output methods to measure service provided, and contract costs are expensed as incurred. The Company establishes billing terms at the time project deliverables and milestones are agreed. Revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled receivables. The risk to the Company on a fixed-price contract is that if estimates to complete the contract change from one period to the next, profit levels will vary from period to period. For time and materials contracts, revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate, as well as reimbursement of other billable direct costs. For all types of contracts, the Company recognizes anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable. The Company also considers whether contracts should be combined or segmented in accordance with the applicable criteria under GAAP. The Company combines closely related contracts when all the applicable criteria under GAAP are met. The combination of two or more contracts requires judgment in determining whether the intent of entering into the contracts was effectively to enter into a single project, which should be combined to reflect an overall profit rate. Similarly, the Company may 51Table of Contentsseparate a project, which may consist of a single contract or group of contracts, with varying rates of profitability, only if the applicable criteria under GAAP are met. Judgment also is involved in determining whether a single contract or group of contracts may be segmented based on how the arrangement was negotiated and the performance criteria. The decision to combine a group of contracts or segment a contract could change the amount of revenue and gross profit recorded in a given period.The use of contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenues and costs, including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the contract, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, anticipated increases in wages and prices for subcontractor services and materials, and the availability of subcontractor services and materials. The Companys estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of its engineers, program managers and other personnel, who review each long-term contract monthly to assess the contracts schedule, performance, technical matters and estimated cost at completion. Changes in estimates are applied retrospectively and when adjustments in estimated contract costs are identified, such revisions may result in current period adjustments to earnings applicable to performance in prior periods.Contract costs also may include estimated contract recoveries for matters such as contract changes and claims for unanticipated contract costs. The Company records revenue associated with these matters only when the amount of recovery can be estimated reliably and realization is probable. Assumed recoveries for claims included in contracts in process were not material at June 30, 2015 or 2014. The Company defines service revenues as revenue from activities that are not associated with the design, development, production, or delivery of tangible assets, software or specific capabilities sold. Examples of the Company service revenues include: analyst services and systems engineering support, consulting, maintenance and other support, testing and installation. The Company combines its product and service revenues into a single class as service revenues are less than 10 percent of total revenues. The Company does not provide its customers with rights of product return, other than those related to warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods. The Company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon product shipment. Revenues from product royalties are recognized upon invoice by the Company. Additionally, all revenues are reported net of government assessed taxes e.g. sales taxes or value-added  equivalents, consisting of highly liquid money market funds and U.S. government and U.S. government agency issues with original maturities of 90days or less at the date of purchase, are carried at fair market value which approximates cost. RESTRICTED CASHThe Company had restricted cash balances of $264and $265as of June30, 2015and 2014, respectively. The balances are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are reflected in non-current assets. The balances at June 30, 2015and 2014included restrictions related to certain contracts with foreign customers that require a certificate of deposit to be held at a commercial bank until performance of the contracts have been completed. FAIRVALUE OFFINANCIALINSTRUMENTSThe Company measures at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities, including cash equivalents, restricted cash and contingent consideration. FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair-value hierarchy:Level1Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;Level2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets;andLevel3Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are  instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. At June30, 2015and 2014, the Company had $77,586and $47,287, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents on deposit or invested with its financial and lending institutions52Table of ContentsThe Company provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary. At June30, 2015, fivecustomers accounted for 55%of the Company receivables, unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings. At June30, 2014, fivecustomers accounted for 55%of the Companys receivables, unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings. INVENTORYInventory is stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market value, and consists of materials, labor and overhead. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates inventory for net realizable value. Once an item is written down, the value becomes the new inventory cost basis. The Company reduces the value of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory, consisting of on-hand and non-cancelable on-order inventory in excess of estimated usage. The excess and obsolete inventory evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative  is the amount by which the cost of the net assets obtained in a business acquisition exceeded the fair values of the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase. Goodwill is not amortized in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and OtherFASB ASC 350. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually, on a reporting unit basis, or when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.Intangible assets result from the Companys various business acquisitions see Note H and certain licensed technologies, and consist of identifiable intangible assets, including completed technology, licensing agreements, customer relationships, trademarks, backlog, and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets are reported at cost, net of accumulated amortization and are either amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of up to sevenyears or over the period the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed. LONG-LIVEDASSETSLong-lived assets primarily include property and equipment and acquired intangible assets. The Company regularly evaluates its long-lived assets for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment in accordance with FASB ASC 360, Property, Plant, and EquipmentFASB ASC 360. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.Property and equipment are the long-lived, physical assets of the Company acquired for use in the Companys normal business operations and are not intended for resale by the Company. These assets are recorded at cost. Renewals and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures that increase the efficiency of the assets are expensed as incurred. Equipment under capital lease is recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments required during the lease period. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method see Note F.As assets are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations.Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally threeyears. For software developed for internal use, all external direct costs for material and services and certain payroll and related fringe benefit costs are capitalized in accordance with FASB ASC 350. During fiscal 2015, 2014and 2013, the Company capitalized $0, $362and $91of software development costs.  revenues consist of deferred product revenue, billings in excess of revenues, and deferred service revenue. Deferred product revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced to customers, but are not yet recognizable as revenue because one or more of the conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. Billings in excess of revenues represents milestone billing arrangements on percentage of completion projects where the billings of the contract exceed recognized revenues. Deferred service revenue primarily represents amounts invoiced to customers for annual maintenance contracts or extended warranty concessions, which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements. Customer advances represent deposits received from customers on an order53Table of ContentsINCOMETAXESThe Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Income TaxesFASB ASC 740. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.FASB ASC 740 requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50%likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax  Companys product sales generally include a 12month standard hardware warranty. At time of product shipment, the Company accrues for the estimated cost to repair or replace potentially defective products. Estimated warranty costs are based upon prior actual warranty costs for substantially similar transactions and any specifically identified warranty requirements. Product warranty accrual is included as part of accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents the changes in the Company product warranty  balance at  assumed from Micronetics acquisition245Accruals for warranties issued during the  made during the  balance at  and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs are primarily made up of labor charges and prototype material and development  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which generally represents the vesting period, and includes an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. Stock-based compensation expense for the Companys performance-based restricted stock awards are amortized over the requisite service period using graded vesting. The companys other restricted stock awards recognize expense over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value on the date of grant of stock options. RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCKStock that is repurchased or received in connection with the exercise of stock options or in order to cover tax payment obligations triggered by exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock is retired immediately upon the Companys repurchase. The Company accounts for this under the cost method and upon retirement the excess amount over par value is charged against additional paid-in  net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per share computation includes the effect of shares which would be issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and the vesting of restricted stock, reduced by the number of shares which are assumed to be purchased by the Company under the treasury stock method. For all periods presented, income loss from continuing operations is the control number for determining whether securities are dilutive or not. 54Table of ContentsBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding were as follows:Years Ended June30,201520142013Basic weighted-average shares  of dilutive equity instruments825Diluted weighted-average shares  instruments to purchase 453, 3,526and 4,077shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended June30, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively, because the equity instruments were  other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains on investments. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income were $776and $1,011of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments at June 30, 2015and 2014. There were nomaterial accumulated net unrealized gains on investments at June 30, 2015and 2014. FOREIGNCURRENCYLocal currencies are the functional currency for the Companys subsidiaries in Europe and Japan. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at period-end for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. The related translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. Gains losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense and were immaterial for all periods  May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for the Company on July 1, 2018 and can be early adopted for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The ASU has added additional disclosure requirements to the codification. It requires management to assess, at each interim and annual reporting period, whether substantial doubt exists about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt exists if it is probable the probable threshold under U.S. GAAP has generally been interpreted to be between 75 and 80 percent that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or available to be issued assessment date. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect a going concern uncertainty in the foreseeable future, and therefore this guidance is not expected to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-17, Pushdown Accounting a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This ASU allows an acquired entity to elect to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements on a change-in-control event. The acquired entity elects whether to apply pushdown accounting individually for each change-in-control event, and may apply pushdown accounting during the reporting period in which the change-in-control event occurs. Effective November 18, 2014, an acquired entity may apply ASU 2014-17 to future change-in-control events. As this guidance is applicable to separate financial statements of acquired entities, the Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This ASU eliminates the separate presentation of extraordinary items, net of tax and the related earnings per share, but does not affect the requirement to disclose material items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring. The ASU aligns U.S. GAAP more closely with IFRS International Financial Reporting Standards. Entities will continue to evaluate whether items are unusual in nature or infrequent in their occurrence for disclosure purposes and when estimating the annual effective tax rate for interim reporting purposes. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The ASU allows prospective 55Table of Contentsor retrospective applications. Early adoption is permitted if applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSEffective July 1, 2014, the Company adopted FASB ASU No2013-11,Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists,an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The ASU requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a decrease in a deferred tax asset when net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, or tax credit carryforwards exist and certain criteria are met. Such adoption did not have a material impact to the Company consolidated financial statements.Effective October 1, 2014, the Company adopted FASB ASU No2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements Topic 205 and Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic 360, an amendment of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The ASU clarifies the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entity operations and financial results. Additionally, the amendments in this ASU require expanded disclosure for discontinued operations to provide users with more information about the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Such adoption did not have a material impact to the Company consolidated financial statements.C.Discontinued OperationsDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company conducted a strategic review of the Mercury Intelligence Systems MIS operating segment which encompassed an assessment of MIS' financial performance and contemporaneous future financial projections. The Company, with Board of Director approval, concluded that a plan to divest the MIS operating segment would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. On January 23, 2015, the Company completed the sale of MIS.In fiscal 2014, the Company MIS operating segment met the held for sale criteria in accordance with FASB ASC 205. As the Company did not anticipate continuing involvement in the operations of MIS after its divestiture, the MIS operating results had been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The classification as held for sale was considered a triggering event for impairment testing under FASB ASC 350 and FASB ASC 360. However, since the Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment testing in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, which coincided with the plan to divest the MIS operating segment, the held for sale triggering event did not constitute a separate goodwill impairment test under FASB ASC 350 see Note H. The triggering event, however, did require separate impairment testing of the MIS asset groups long-lived assets under FASB ASC 360.The goodwill impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 determined the MIS reporting unit carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, resulting in a $6,687impairment charge. The impairment charge is reflected within discontinued operations of the Company accompanying consolidated financial statements. The failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test was driven by a decline in forecasted results of the MIS reporting unit. The fair value of the MIS reporting unit from the first step of the goodwill impairment test exceeded the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the MIS reporting unit, as determined by the second step of the goodwill impairment test. Testing of the valuation of long-lived assets of the MIS asset group indicated no impairment, as the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the MIS asset group, less estimated costs to sell, significantly exceeded its carrying value. MIS was considered its own operating segment and was previously aggregated with MDS into one reportable segment based on similar economic and qualitative factors in accordance with FASB ASC 280.As MIS became a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the results of MIS had been excluded from the MDS reportable segment. Accordingly, the revenues, costs of revenue, operating expenses, assets and liabilities of MIS have been reported separately as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss and Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. The discontinued operation balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets do not reflect intercompany receivable balances of MIS, and the results of discontinued operations do not reflect interest expense or the allocation of the Company corporate general and administrative expenses.During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company determined that the MIS reporting unit carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, resulting in a further goodwill impairment charge of $2,283. This impairment charge is reflected within discontinued operations of the Company accompanying fiscal 2015 consolidated financial statements. On January 23, 2015, the Company completed the sale of MIS for approximately $1,600. The sale resulted in net proceeds of $885and a loss on disposal of $892, which is reflected within discontinued operations of the Company accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company does not have continuing involvement in the operations of MIS after its divestiture56Table of ContentsThe amounts reported in loss income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes were as follows:For the Years Ended June30,201520142013Net revenues of discontinued  of discontinued operations:Cost of  general and  and  of intangible assets279495495Restructuring and other charges264Impairment of goodwill2,2836,687Loss income from discontinued operations before income taxes3,7177,7641,121Loss on disposal of discontinued operations before income taxes892Tax benefit provision549411547Loss income from discontinued  amounts reported as assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations were as follows:June30,2014Accounts receivable, net$925Unbilled receivables and costs in excess of billings248Deferred income taxes77Prepaid expenses and other current assets124Property and equipment, net475Goodwill2,283Intangible assets, net2,062Other non-current assets39Assets of discontinued operations$6,233Accounts payable$127Accrued expenses802Accrued compensation689Deferred income taxes818Liabilities of discontinued operations$2,436The depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures and significant operating and investing non-cash items of the discontinued operations were as follows:For the Years Ended  of intangible assets$279$495$495Capital  of  compensation expense$88$245$8657Table of ContentsD.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe following table summarizes the Companys financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June30,  30,   of deposit30,00030,000Restricted cash264264Cost-method  carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, including U.S. Treasury bills and money market funds, accounts receivable and payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. The value of the certificates of deposit is based on the quoted price for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or are directly or indirectly observable. The cost-method investment does not have a readily determinable fair value, as such the Company recorded the investment as a long term asset at cost and will continue to evaluate the asset for impairment. The following table summarizes the Companys financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June30,  30,    change of the fair value of the Company investment in equity is as follows:FairValueBalance at June 30, 2014$Cost-method investment500Balance at June 30, 2015$500E.InventoryInventory was comprised of the following:June30,20152014Raw materials$15,864$13,755Work in process11,19012,677Finished  are noamounts in inventory relating to contracts having production cycles longer than one year. 58Table of ContentsF.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment consisted of the  equipment and  and fixtures57,6147,556Leasehold  life or lease term4,0033,758Machinery and  accumulated  fiscal 2015and 2014, the Company retired $733and $715, respectively, of fully depreciated computer equipment and software assets that were no longer in use by the Company.Depreciation expense related to property and equipment for the fiscal years ended June30, 2015, 2014and 2013was $6,332, $7,625and $8,445, respectively.On June 27, 2013, the Company entered into a sales agreement and a separate short-term lease agreement in connection with the Companys legacy Hudson, New Hampshire, facility. Pursuant to the sale agreement, the Company sold all land, land improvements, buildings and building improvements related to the facility. The loss on the sale of the facility was approximately $1,091and is recorded in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. On April20, 2007, the Company entered into a sales agreement and a lease agreement in connection with a sale-leaseback of the Companys headquarters in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. Pursuant to the agreements, the Company sold all land, land improvements, buildings and building improvements related to the facilities and leased back those assets. The term of the lease is tenyears and includes twofiveyear options to renew. Under the provisions of sale-leaseback accounting, the transaction was considered a normal leaseback; thus the realized gain of $11,569was deferred and will be amortized to other income on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term.The unamortized deferred gain consisted of the following of which the current portion is included in accrued expenses and the non-current portion is separately classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets:June30,20152014Current  portion9292,086Total unamortized deferred gain$2,085$3,242G.GoodwillThe following table summarizes the changes in goodwill for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2015:MCEMDSTotalBalance at June 30,  adjustments during fiscal 2014595595Balance at June30, 2014 and 2015$134,378$33,768$168,146In accordance with FASB ASC 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and OtherFASB ASC 350, the Company determines its reporting units based upon whether discrete financial information is available, if management regularly reviews the operating results of the component, the nature of the products offered to customers and the market characteristics of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is considered to be an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component. MCE has fourcomponents with discrete financial information available which are reviewed by their segment manager; however, those fourcomponents are economically similar in nature and thus have been aggregated into a single reporting unit at the operating segment level. MDS is a sole component and the reporting unit is at the operating segment level. The Company determined that its reporting units are the same as its operating segments, MCE and MDS. 59Table of ContentsAs defined by FASB ASC 350, goodwill is tested for impairment on an interim basis at the occurrence of certain triggering events or at a minimum on an annual basis. In fiscal 2015, there were no triggering events from continuing operations which required an interim goodwill impairment test. The Company follows FASB ASC 350 in assessing whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of June30, 2015, both MCE and MDS had goodwill balances and the annual impairment analysis was performed for each reporting unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The results of the Company step one interim goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair values of the MCE and MDS reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values. As such, step two of the goodwill impairment testing was not required. Consistent with prior years, the valuation was based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and corroborated by a market-based analysis which compares the trading multiples of public companies in similar lines of business.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company eliminated 16positions, primarily in operations, in the MCE reportable segment. During fiscal 2014, the Company announced a restructuring plan 2014 Plan that was implemented as part of the final phase of integration activities relating to the Companys recent acquisitions. The acquisition integration plan included the consolidation of manufacturing facilities, centralization of administrative functions using common information systems and processes, and realignment of research and development resources. The acquisition integration plan included the elimination of 70positions largely in engineering, manufacturing and administrative functions. Additionally, the Company closed fourfacilities relocating all related activities to the Company Advanced Microelectronics Center AMC in Hudson, New Hampshire. The 60Company also completed the first phase of the Chelmsford, Massachusetts headquarters consolidation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. These restructuring and other charges associated with the Company fiscal 2014 restructuring plan amounted to $5,443and affected both MCE and MDS reportable segments. In the event that the Company is unable to sublease the unoccupied portion of its headquarters complex in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, it will incur nominal, periodic restructuring charges through fiscal 2017 in its MCE reportable segment. All of the restructuring and other charges are classified as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining severance obligations are expected to be paid within the next twelve months. The remaining restructuring liability is classified as accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.The following table presents the detail of expenses by reportable segment for the Companys restructuring plans:Severance RelatedFacilities OtherTotalRestructuring liability at June 30, 2013$434$286$720MCE restructuring charges3,9611,5125,473MDS restructuring charges5555Cash  *256085Restructuring liability at June 30, 20141,3717722,143MCE restructuring charges1,6141,8123,426MDS restructuring charges4949Cash   liability at June 30, 2015$657$1,335$1,992* Reversals result from the unused outplacement services and operating costs61Table of ContentsJ.Income TaxesThe components of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and income tax expense benefit were as follows:Year Ended June30,201520142013Income loss from continuing operations before income taxes:United  provision  following is the reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the Companys effective income tax benefit rate for continuing operations:Year Ended June30,201520142013Tax provision benefit at federal statutory rates350%350%350%State income tax, net of federal tax benefit493118Research and development  manufacturing deduction3253Deemed repatriation of foreign earnings0407Foreign tax credits133Equity  compensation28111Stock compensation shortfalls241Deferred tax asset and liability adjustments42Change in state tax rates31Reserves for tax contingencies50Acquisition costs05Valuation  of ContentsThe components of the Companys net deferred tax assets liabilities for continuing operations were as  tax assets:Inventory valuation and receivable allowances$9,264$8,830Accrued compensation2,563972Equity compensation4,2294,831Federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards16,26211,167Gain on sale-leaseback8341,232Other accruals1,8891,043Capital loss carryforwards3,562Other temporary   deferred tax assets21,53921,243Deferred tax liabilities:Prepaid expenses1,103Property and  assets7,1109,242Tax method of accounting change854Other temporary differences320624Total deferred tax  deferred tax assets$10,574$9,683As reported:Current deferred tax  deferred tax assets included in other non-current assets1,275378Non-current deferred tax  June30, 2015, the Company evaluated the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. In assessing whether the deferred tax assets are realizable, management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company past operating results, its forecast of future earnings, future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. The Company continues to conclude that it is more likely than not that most domestic deferred tax assets would be realizable based on the financial performance in fiscal year 2015, projected future taxable income and the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities.The Company continues to record a full valuation allowance on certain state research and development RD and investment tax credits, and capital loss carryforwards as of June30, 2015as management continues to believe that it is not more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized. Any future reversals of the valuation allowance will impact income tax expense.The Company had federal research and development credit carryforwards of $959, which will expire from 2032through 2033. The Company had state research and development credit carryforwards of $14,899, which will expire from 2016through 2029. The Company also had state investment tax credits carryforwards of $404.Upon consideration of changing business conditions and cash position in its foreign subsidiaries, management has determined that it does not need to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company has accrued deferred taxes in association with $672in undistributed earnings and profits.The Company files income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company has established reserves to provide for additional income taxes that management believes will more likely than not be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited. These reserves have been established based upon managements assessment as to the potential exposures. All tax reserves are analyzed quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur and warrant modification63Table of ContentsThe changes in the Companys reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits are summarized as  tax benefits, beginning of period$3,142$2,923Increases for previously recognized positions123102Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statue of  for currently recognized positions122283Unrecognized tax benefits, end of period$2,190$3,142The $2,190of unrecognized tax benefits as of June30, 2015, if released, would reduce income tax expense.The Companys major tax jurisdiction is the U.S. and the open tax years are fiscal 2011 through 2015.The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal year 2013. There have been no significant changes to the status of this examination during the year ended June 30, 2015. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months the Companys unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, may decrease by up to $757at the conclusion of the audit. We expect that the decrease, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate.K.Commitments and ContingenciesLEGALCLAIMSThe Company is subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, the Company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to any matters currently pending against the Company and intends to defend itself vigorously. The outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company cash flows, results of operations, or financial position. INDEMNIFICATIONOBLIGATIONSThe Company standard product sales and license agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business typically contain an indemnification provision pursuant to which the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with any patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Company products. Such provisions generally survive termination or expiration of the agreements. The potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is, in some instances, unlimited. In connection with the sale of the Companys former MIS business, the Company provided indemnification to the buyer of the business. The Companys indemnification obligations generally cover the buyer for damages resulting from breaches of representations, warranties and covenants contained in the purchase and sale agreement and generally cover pre-closing tax liabilities of the business. The Companys indemnification obligations regarding the MIS business are generally subject to caps.PURCHASECOMMITMENTSAs of June30, 2015, the Company has entered into non-cancelable purchase commitments for certain inventory components and services used in its normal operations. The purchase commitments covered by these agreements are for less than one year and aggregate to $27,37664Table of ContentsLEASECOMMITMENTSThe Company leases certain facilities, machinery and equipment under various cancelable and non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through fiscal 2025. The leases contain various renewal options. Rental charges are subject to escalation for increases in certain operating costs of the lessor. For tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays, the Company records a deferred rent liability on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Rental expense during the fiscal years ended June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013was $3,777, $4,213and $4,167, respectively. Minimum lease payments under the Companys non-cancelable operating leases are as  minimum lease  October12, 2012, the Company entered into a credit agreement the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, with KeyBank National Association acting as the administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a $200,000senior unsecured revolving line of credit the Revolver. The Company can borrow up to $200,000based on its consolidated EBITDA for the prior trailing four quarters and subject to compliance with the financial covenants discussed below. The Revolver is available for working capital, acquisitions, and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Revolver is available for borrowing during a fiveyear period, with interest payable periodically during such period as provided in the Credit Agreement and principal due at the maturity of the Revolver. The Credit Agreement has an accordion feature permitting the Company to request from the lenders an increase in the aggregate amount of the credit facility in the form of an incremental revolver or term loan in an amount not to exceed $50,000. Any such increase would require only the consent of the lenders increasing their respective commitments under the credit facility. The interest rates applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement involve various rate options that are available to the Company. The rates are calculated using a combination of conventional base rate measures plus a margin over those rates. The base rates consist of LIBOR rates or prime rates. The actual rates will depend on the level of these underlying rates plus a margin based on the Company leverage at the time of borrowing. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are senior unsecured loans. Each of the Company domestic subsidiaries is a guarantor under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for conventional affirmative and negative covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio of 350x and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 30x. Each of the two ratios referred to above is calculated based on consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, for each consecutive four fiscal quarter period, after giving pro forma effect for any acquisitions. Acquisitions are permitted under the Credit Agreement without any dollar limitation so long as, among other requirements, no default or event of default exists or would result. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, and events of default. As of June30, 2015, there was $151,549of borrowing capacity available based on our consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four quarters ended June30, 2015. There were noborrowings outstanding on the Credit Agreement; however, there were outstanding letters of credit of $3,839. As of June30, 2015, the Company is in compliance with the covenants in the Credit Agreement65M.Shareholders EquityPREFERREDSTOCKThe Company is authorized to issue 1,000shares of preferred stock with a par value of $001per share.SHAREHOLDERRIGHTSPLANIn June 2015, the Company Board of Directors terminated the Shareholder Rights Plan and the associated rights effective as of June 30, 2015.

During fiscal 2015, 2014and 2013, the Company matched employee contributions up to 3%of eligible compensation. The Company may also make optional contributions to the plan for any plan year at its discretion. Expense recognized by the Company for matching contributions related to the 401k plan was $1,934, $1,896and $1,992during the fiscal years ended June30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.O.Stock-Based  number of shares authorized for issuance under the Companys 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated the 2005 Plan, is 11,424shares at June30, 2015. On October 21, 2014, the Company number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2005 Plan increased by 3,406shares, including 3,200shares approved by the Company shareholders at the 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and 206shares as a result of forfeitures, cancellations and/or terminations from the Company 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan. The 2005 Plan will be increased by any future cancellations, forfeitures or terminations other than by exercise under the 1997 Plan. The 2005 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and deferred stock awards to employees and non-employees. All stock options are granted with an exercise price of not less than 100%of the fair value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant and the options generally have a term of seven years. There were 3,648shares available for future grant under the 2005 Plan at June30, 2015.The number of shares authorized for issuance under the 1997 Plan was 8,650shares, of which 100shares could be issued pursuant to restricted stock grants. The 1997 Plan provided for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options and restricted stock to employees and non-employees. All stock options were granted with an exercise price of not less than 100%of the fair value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant. The options typically vest over periods of zeroto fouryears and have a maximum term of 10years. Following shareholder approval of the 2005 Plan on November14, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors determined that no further grants of stock options or other awards would be made under the 1997 Plan, and the 1997 Plan subsequently expired in June 2007. The foregoing does not affect any outstanding awards under the 1997 Plan, which remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.On August 15, 2014, as part of the Company ongoing annual equity grant program for employees, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock awards to certain executives pursuant to the 2005 Plan. These performance awards vest annually over a threeyear requisite service period subject to the achievement of specific financial performance targets related to adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. Based on the performance targets, these awards require graded vesting that results in more rapid expense recognition compared to traditional time-based vesting over the same vesting period. The Company monitors the probability of achieving the performance targets on a quarterly basis and may adjust periodic compensation expense  number of shares authorized for issuance under the Companys 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated ESPP, is 1,400shares. Under the ESPP, rights are granted to purchase shares of common stock at 85%of the lesser of the market value of such shares at either the beginning or the end of each six-month offering period. The ESPP permits employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 10%of an employees compensation as defined in the ESPP. The number of shares issued under the ESPP during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013was 79, 92and 104, respectively.

The Company utilizes the management approach for determining reportable segments in accordance with the authoritative guidance. The following operating segments were determined based upon the nature of the products offered to customers, the market characteristics of each operating segment and the Company management structure: Mercury Commercial Electronics MCE: this operating segment delivers more affordable, innovative, commercially developed, specialized processing subsystems powering today critical defense and intelligence applications. MCE delivers secure solutions that are based upon open architectures and widely adopted industry standards. MCE delivers rapid time-to-value and service and support to prime defense contractors and commercial customers. MCE provides solutions to prime contractor customers on a variety of programs. MCE also provides technology building blocks to Mercury Defense Systems on key classified and unclassified programs. MCE has a legacy of embedded multi-computing and embedded sensor processing expertise. More recently, MCE has added substantial capabilities around radio frequency RF and microwave technologies as well as emerging new manufacturing capabilities to bring design, production and test capabilities of its RF and microwave solutions to market on a more scalable basis.Mercury Defense Systems MDS: this operating segment provides significant capabilities relating to pre-integrated, open, more affordable electronic warfare EW, electronic attack EA and electronic counter measure ECM subsystems, and signals intelligence SIGINT and electro-optical/infrared EO/IR processing technologies and radar environmental test and simulation systems. MDS deploys these solutions on behalf of defense prime contractors and the Department of Defense DoD, leveraging commercially available technologies and solutions or building blocks from the MCE business and other commercial suppliers. MDS leverages this technology to develop integrated sensor processing subsystems, often including classified application-specific software and intellectual property IP for the 68Table of ContentsC4ISR command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, EW, and ECM markets. MDS brings significant domain expertise to customers, drawing on over 25 years of experience in EW, SIGINT, and radar environment test and simulation.The Company operating segments were evaluated in accordance with FASB ASC 280 Segment Reporting in order to determine which operating segments qualified as reportable segments. The Company determined that both MCE and MDS met the quantitative thresholds for reporting.The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note B: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The profitability measure employed by the Company and its CODM as the basis for allocating resources to segments and assessing segment performance is adjusted EBITDA. The Company believes the adjusted EBITDA financial measure assists in providing an enhanced understanding of its underlying operational measures to manage its business, to evaluate its performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition and financing costs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting and stock-based compensation costs. Additionally, asset information by reportable segment is not reported because the Company and its CODM utilize consolidated asset information when making business decisions.
