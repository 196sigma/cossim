conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

Commitments The Company has committed to lease premises in the Cayman Islands for a period
of two years from February 1, 2000 at approximately $75,000 per annum.
The Company is subject to an ongoing obligation to supply water to new customers
in the Cayman Islands within the areas in which it is licensed to operate and
where the supply of such water is considered commercially feasible.
The Company is subject to a commitment in the Cayman Islands under the Water
Purchase Agreement Note 14.
The Group is subject to a commitment to supply water to the Water and Sewerage
Authority of Belize and property in South Bimini Island, Bahamas Note 15. Contingencies The license that the Company has with the government of the Cayman Islands the
Government requires it to obtain approval from the Government for the
issuance or transfer of shares which a exceeds 5% of the issued share capital
of the Company, or b would, upon registration, result in any shareholder owning
more than 5% of the issued share capital of the Company.
More than 5% of the ordinary shares of common stock are registered in the name
of Cede and Co., the nominee for Depository Trust Company, which is a clearing
agency for shares held by participating banks and brokers. The Company does not
believe that these shareholdings by Cede and Co. constitute a breach of the
intent of the license. The Company believes that the purpose of this clause of
the license is to allow the Government to approve significant shareholders of
the Company. Cede and Co. and Depository Trust Company, however, act solely as
the nominee for banks and brokers, and have no beneficial ownership in the
ordinary shares of common stock. Nevertheless, the Company Cayman Islands
legal counsel Legal Counsel has advised it that the shareholdings by Cede
and Co. are probably a technical breach of its license.
In August and September 1994, the Company completed an offering of 400,000
ordinary shares of common stock under rule 504 of Regulation D of the Securities
Act of 1933. In September 1995, the Company completed a private placement of
100,000 ordinary shares of common stock plus warrants to subscribe for an
additional 100,000 ordinary shares of common stock under Regulation S of the
Securities Act of 1933. In April 1996 and May 2000, the Company completed a
public offering of 515,000 and 773,000 ordinary shares, respectively. Based upon
the advice of Legal Counsel, the Company determined that the license did not
require the Government approval to complete these offerings. However, if a
court determined that the Government approval of these offerings was required
under the license, the Company would be in breach of the license. Legal Counsel
has advised the Company that in order to make this determination, a court would
have to disagree with the Company interpretation of the license and dismiss
several defenses that would be available to the Company. These defenses include
acquiescence and waiver on the part of the Government with respect to these
offerings.
Further, the Company received a letter dated June 1, 2000, from an official in
the Government, stating that the public offering of the ordinary shares of
common stock that was completed in 1996 was a breach of the license. The letter
is not clear as to whether the Government views the public offering completed in
2000 as a breach of the license. The Company responded to this letter and stated
that it does not believe that it is in breach of the license. A meeting with
officials of the Government, to discuss this matter, was held on June 16, 2000
in accordance with the Government suggestion in the June 1st letter.
Discussion of the matter is ongoing as of December 31, 2000. The Company has
been advised by Legal Counsel that the June 1st letter from the Government does
not constitute a formal notice of breach of the license as contemplated in the
license. Accordingly, other than pursuing discussions of this matter with the
Government, no other actions are presently being pursued by the Company to
cure any such alleged breaches.                    52

Royalty expenses incurred during the year under the terms of the license to
process and supply potable water, granted by the Government, amounted to
$641,428 1999: $560,441; 1998: $570,416. In accordance with the terms of the
license, royalties are payable at the rate of 75% of gross water sales.
Payments are made monthly in arrears. 19. PENSION BENEFITS
A staff pension scheme commenced during June 1995 and was offered to all
employees, both full and part-time. The scheme is administered by the Cayman
Islands Chamber of Commerce and is a defined contribution plan, whereby the
Company matches the contribution of the first 5% of each participating
employee salary. The total amount recognized as an expense under the scheme
during 2000 was $67,760 1999: $48,554 1998: $45,537. 20. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
CREDIT RISK Financial assets that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. The majority of
the Company cash balances are placed with high credit quality financial
institutions. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company operations in
Belize as described in Note 1 are concentrated with one customer. As a result,
the Company is subject to credit risk to the extent of any non-performance by
this customer. As at December 31, 2000 the Company was owed $348,959 from this
customer. Credit risk with respect to the remainder of the accounts receivable
balance is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Company
customer base and the ability of the Company to withdraw supply in the event of
non-payment.
INTEREST RATE RISK The interest rates and terms of the Company loans and Water Purchase Agreement
are presented in Notes 7 and 14 respectively.
FAIR VALUES At December 31, 2000 and 1999 the carrying amounts of cash and short term bank
deposits and bank overdrafts, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximated their fair values due to the short term maturities of
these assets and liabilities. The Directors consider that the carrying amount
for long term debt Note 7 due to Royal Bank of Canada approximates fair value
due to the characteristics of this debt. The fair value for long term debt due
to European Investment Bank is approximately $1,207,000 1999: $1,400,000
although this does not necessarily indicate that the Company could extinguish
this debt for an amount lower than the carrying value. Fair value of this long
term debt for which no market value is readily available is determined by the
Company using predetermined future cash flows discounted at an estimated current
incremental rate of borrowing for a similar liability. In establishing an
estimated incremental rate, the Company has evaluated the existing transactions,
as well as comparable industry and economic data and other relevant factors such
as pending transactions, subsequent events and the amount the Company would have
to pay a credit worthy third party to assume the liability, with the creditors
legal consent.                    58
