Notes to Consolidated Financial  25 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consolidated
Delivery & Logistics, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements and
the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated
Delivery & Logistics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index to
financial statement schedules is the responsibility of the Company management
and is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc. the Company was founded in June
1994. In November 1995, simultaneously with the closing of the Company initial
public offering the Offering separate wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Company merged the Merger with each of eleven acquired  businesses.
Consideration for the acquisition of these businesses consisted of a combination
of cash and common stock of the Company, par value $0001 per share. The assets
and liabilities of the acquired businesses at September 30, 1995 were recorded
by the Company at their historical amounts.
Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc. and Subsidiaries CDL provides an
extensive network of same-day ground and air delivery services to a wide range
of commercial, industrial and retail customers. CDL ground delivery operations
currently are concentrated on the East Coast, with a strategic presence both in
the Midwest and on the West Coast. CDL air delivery services are provided
throughout the United States and to major cities around the world.
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of the Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents CDL considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost,
which approximates market value. Included in cash and cash equivalents is cash
restricted for a national marketing and advertising program for CDL sales
agency agreements see Note 13.
Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements and assets subject to capital leases are
amortized over the shorter of the terms of the leases or lives of the assets.
Deferred Financing Costs The costs incurred for obtaining financing, including all related legal and
accounting fees are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and are amortized over the life of the related financing from 2 -
7 years.
Intangible Assets Intangible  assets consist of goodwill,  customer lists, and non-compete
agreements. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of assets of businesses acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis
over 25 years to 40 years. Customer lists and non-compete agreements are
amortized over the estimated period to be benefited, generally from 3 to 5
years. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when the shipment is completed, or when services are
rendered to customers, and expenses are recognized as incurred. Certain
customers pay in advance, giving rise to deferred revenue.
Income Taxes CDL accounts for income taxes utilizing the liability approach. Deferred income
taxes are provided for differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities
for tax and financial reporting purposes. Temporary differences result primarily
from accelerated depreciation and amortization for tax purposes and various
accruals and reserves being deductible for tax purposes in future periods.
Long-Lived Assets CDL reviews its long-lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment
whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable. The measurement of impairment losses to be
recognized is based on the difference between the fair values and the carrying
amounts of the assets. Impairment would be recognized in operating results if a
diminution in value occurred. The Company does not believe that any such changes
have occurred.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Due to the short maturities of CDL cash, receivables and payables, the
carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair values.
The fair value of CDL debt is estimated based on the current rates offered to
CDL for debt with similar remaining maturities. CDL believes that the carrying
value of its debt estimates the fair value of such debt instruments.
Stock Based Compensation Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123 requires that an entity account for employee stock
compensation under a fair value based method. However, SFAS 123 also allows an
entity to continue to measure compensation cost for employee stock-based
compensation plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting
prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
Opinion 25. CDL has elected to continue to account for employee stock-based
compensation under Opinion 25 and provide the required pro forma disclosures as
if the fair value based method of accounting under SFAS 123 had been applied
see Note 14. Income Loss Per Share Basic earnings per share represents net income loss divided by the weighted
average shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share represents net income
loss divided by weighted average shares outstanding  adjusted for the
incremental dilution of common stock equivalents
A reconciliation of weighted average common shares outstanding to weighted
average common shares outstanding assuming dilution follows                              1999        1998         1997

3   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On February 16, 1999, CDL entered into and consummated an asset and stock
purchase agreement with its subsidiary,  Sureway Air Traffic Corporation
Sureway and Victory Messenger Service, Inc., Richard Gold, Darobin Freight
Forwarding Co., Inc.,Darobin and The Trust Created Under Paragraph Third of
the Last Will and Testament of Charles Gold the Trust, collectively Gold
Wings, whereby Sureway purchased all of the outstanding shares of the capital
stock of Darobin and certain of the assets and liabilities of the other sellers.
The purchase price was comprised of approximately $30 million in cash including
estimated direct acquisition costs, $1,650,000 in a 7% subordinated note the
Note and 200,000 shares of CDL common stock at $3875 per share. The Note is
due April 16, 2001 with interest payable quarterly commencing April 1, 1999. The
Note is subordinate to all existing or future senior debt of CDL. In addition, a
contingent earn out in the aggregate amount of up to $520,000 is payable based
on the achievement of certain financial goals during the two year period
following the closing. The earn out is payable 55% in cash and 45% in CDL common
stock.
On April 30, 1999, CDL entered into and consummated an asset purchase agreement
with its subsidiary, Silver Star Express, Inc. Silver Star and Metro Parcel
Service, Inc., Nathan Spaulding and Kelly M. Spaulding, collectively, Metro
Parcel, whereby Silver Star purchased certain of the assets and liabilities of
Metro Parcel. The purchase price was comprised of approximately $710,000 in
cash, $202,734 in a 7% subordinated note the Metro Parcel Note and 40,000
shares of CDL common stock at $325 per share. The Metro Parcel Note is due
April 30, 2001 with interest payable quarterly commencing August 1, 1999. The
Metro Parcel Note is subordinate to all existing or future senior debt of CDL.
On April 30, 1999, CDL entered into and consummated an asset purchase agreement
with its subsidiary, Clayton/National Courier Systems, Inc. Clayton/National
and Westwind Express, Inc., Logistics Delivery Systems, Inc., Fastrak Delivery
Systems,  Inc., Sierra Delivery  Services,  Inc., and Steven S. Keihner
collectively, Westwind, whereby Clayton/National purchased certain of the
assets and liabilities of Westwind. The purchase price was comprised of
approximately $2,650,000 in cash, $1,680,000 in various 7% subordinated notes
the Westwind Notes and 149,533 shares of CDL common stock at $321 per
share. The Westwind Notes are comprised of two-year notes due April 30, 2001
with a total principal amount of $1,200,000 and three-year notes due April 30,
2002 with a total principal amount of $480,000. Interest on the Westwind Notes
is payable quarterly  commencing July 31, 1999. The Westwind Notes are
subordinate to all existing or future senior debt of CDL. In addition, a
contingent earn out in the aggregate amount of up to $700,000 is payable based

On May 10, 1999, CDL entered into and consummated an asset purchase agreement
the Skycab Purchase Agreement with its subsidiary, Sureway and Skycab, Inc.
and Martin Shulman collectively, Skycab, whereby Sureway purchased certain
assets of Skycab. The purchase price was comprised of approximately $78,100 in
cash. In addition, a contingent earn out is payable for sixteen quarters following the closing date. The amount of the earn-out per
quarter is the greater of either $6,250 or 15% of collected revenues for the
three-month period then ended, as defined in the Skycab Purchase Agreement.
Any payments of the earnouts discussed above will increase the goodwill recorded
for the acquisition of the applicable company. The amortization of any
additional goodwill and the conversion of any of the convertible notes payable
into common stock will negatively affect the Company future earnings per
share.
CDL financed each of the above acquisitions using proceeds from its revolving
credit facility with First Union Commercial Corporation. All of the above
transactions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, the allocation of the cost of the acquired assets and liabilities
have been made on the basis of the estimated fair value. The aggregate amount of
goodwill recorded for the Gold Wings, Metro Parcel and Skycab acquisitions is
$64 million to be amortized over 25 years. The goodwill for the Westwind
acquisition is $51 million to be amortized over 40 years. The consolidated
financial statements include the operating results of Gold Wings, Metro Parcel,
Westwind, and Skycab from their respective acquisition dates.
The following summarized unaudited pro forma financial information was prepared
assuming that the Gold Wings, Metro Parcel, Westwind and Skycab acquisitions
occurred on the first day of such periods and include certain pro forma
adjustments. This information is not necessarily indicative of the results the
Company would have obtained had these events actually occurred on such dates or
of the Company actual or future results in thousands, except per share
amounts.                                For the Year         For the Year

as purchases. The total consideration paid in these transactions is contingent
upon future activity and is estimated to aggregate $145 million, which consists
of $80 million paid in cash and 206,185 shares of Common Stock at $344 per
share. Of this amount $139 million has been assigned to the excess of purchase
price over net assets of businesses acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets. The purchase price was subsequently reduced by approximately $754,000
during 1999 due to actual revenue not reaching projected revenue as stipulated
in the purchase agreements. Accordingly, goodwill and seller financed debt were
reduced by this amount to reflect the reduction in the purchase price. Final
determinations of the individual acquisition costs will be made by May 2003. The
results of the acquired businesses have been reflected in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations since their respective acquisition dates.
4   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On December 31, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement providing for the
sale of certain assets of its fulfillment and direct mail business. The selling
price for the assets was $850,000 and is comprised of $125,000 in cash with the
remainder in the form of a promissory note the Note Receivable. The Note
Receivable bore interest at the rate of 6% per annum, with interest only in
monthly installments during 1998.  Commencing February 1, 1999 the Note
Receivable was to be paid in equal monthly installments of $14,016 including
principal and interest through January 1, 2004. The Note Receivable was included
in prepaid expenses in the amount of $117,000 and in security deposits in the
amount of $608,000 at December 31, 1998 in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The purchaser has defaulted on the balance of the note and made or will
make no payments since it ceased business in July 1999. The Company wrote off
the remaining balance of approximately $662,000 during 1999.
Accordingly, the financial position, operating results and the gain on the
disposition of the Company fulfillment and direct mail business have been
segregated from continuing operations and reclassified as a discontinued
operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Results from the discontinued fulfillment and direct mail business for the year
ended December 31, 1997 included $5,937 of Revenue, a loss from discontinued
operations of $1,221 net of an income tax benefit of $811 and a gain on the
disposal of assets of $23 net of an income tax provision of $15.

9 SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT Short-term borrowings -
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had a line of credit agreement for

Weighted average borrowing cost during the year    98%        91%        94 In November 1998, CDL and First Union Commercial Corporation First Union
modified an agreement entered into in July 1997, establishing a revolving credit
facility the First Union Agreement. The First Union Agreement increased the
original credit facility from $15 million to $225 million, provided CDL with an
equipment acquisition term loan facility of up to $25 million and modified
other terms and conditions. Credit availability is based on eligible amounts of
accounts receivable, as defined, up to a maximum amount of $225 million and is
secured by substantially all of the assets, including certain cash balances,
accounts  receivable,  equipment and leasehold  improvements  and general
intangibles of the Company and its subsidiaries. The First Union Agreement
provides for both fixed and variable rate loans. Interest rates on fixed rate
borrowings are based on LIBOR which was 600% at December 31, 1999, plus 15%
to 2%. Variable rate borrowings are based on First Union prime lending rate
which was 825% at December 31, 1999, minus 25% to plus 25%. Based on
eligible accounts receivable at December 31, 1999, $82 million of the credit
facility and $25 million of the equipment acquisition term loan facility was
available for future borrowings.
Under the terms of the First Union Agreement, the Company is required to
maintain certain financial ratios and comply with other financial conditions.
The First Union Agreement also prohibits the Company from incurring certain
additional indebtedness, limits certain investments, advances or loans and
restricts substantial asset sales, capital expenditures and cash dividends. At
December 31, 1999 the Company was in compliance with all loan covenants.
Long-Term Debt      On January 29, 1999, the Company completed a $15 million private
placement of senior subordinated notes and warrants with three financial
institutions. The notes bear interest at 12% per annum and are subordinate to all senior debt including the Company credit facility with First Union. Under
the terms of the notes, the Company is required to maintain certain financial
ratios and comply with other financial conditions for which the Company was in
compliance as of December 31, 1999. The notes mature on January 29, 2006 and may
be prepaid by the Company under certain circumstances. The warrants expire on
January 19, 2009 and are exercisable at any time prior to expiration at a price
of $001 per equivalent share of common stock for an aggregate of 506,250 shares
of the Company stock, subject to additional adjustments. The Company has
recorded the fair value of the warrants of $1,265,000 as a credit to additional
paid-in-capital and a debt discount on the senior subordinated notes. The
Company used the proceeds to finance acquisitions and to reduce outstanding
short-term borrowings.

12   REPORTABLE SEGMENTS CDL presently has two reportable segments: Air and Ground. The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. Separate management of each segment is required
because each business unit is subject to different cost and delivery parameters.
The Company has announced plans to re-align its business operations and is
presently evaluating the effect if any, this change will have on its reportable
segments.                                 Air      Ground      Total

freight, next flight out and international shipments whereby package movement is
by air generally on scheduled airline flights. CDL ground delivery services are
provided to customers by a CDL driver in a vehicle either on a rush basis or on
a regularly scheduled route basis. Air revenue is generally measured by package
while ground delivery revenue is generally measured by the number of stops
involved.
Intersegment revenue results from the provision of ground service for the
pick-up or delivery of packages for delivery to airports or from airports to
customers. The Air division also provides delivery by air of time critical
material for ultimate distribution by ground based drivers. Management evaluates
the performance of each segment based on its overall contribution to the
Company net income after factoring in the allocation of interest as well as an
intersegment  charge of 2% of segment  revenue for overall general and
administrative expenses.
13   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating Leases The Company leases its office and warehouse facilities under noncancellable
operating leases, which expire at various dates through January 2004. The
approximate minimum rental commitments of the Company, under existing agreements
as of December 31, 1999, are as follows in thousands 2000                                   $2,750
2001                                   2,377
2002                                   1,479
2003                                    651
2004                                    437
Rent expense related to operating leases amounted to approximately $138
million, $127 million and $131 million for the years ended December 31, 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively.
Litigation In February 1996, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company Liberty Mutual filed an
action against Securities Courier Corporation Securities, a subsidiary of
the Company, Mr. Vincent Brana and certain other parties in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging, among other
things, that Securities Courier had fraudulently obtained automobile liability
insurance from Liberty Mutual in the late 1980s and early 1990s at below market
rates. This suit, which claims common law fraud, fraudulent inducement, unjust
enrichment and violations of the civil provisions of the Federal RICO statute,
among other things, seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive
damages from the defendants, as well as attorneys' fees and other expenses. Three additional defendants were added by way of a second amended complaint on
April 9, 1998. Securities and Mr. Brana have filed cross claims against each of
these additional defendants and certain original defendants who had acted as
insurance brokers for certain of the policies at issue. Under the terms of its
acquisition of Securities, the Company has certain rights to indemnification
from Mr. Brana. In connection with the indemnification, Mr. Brana has entered
into a Settlement Agreement and executed a Promissory Note in the amount of up
to $500,000 or such greater amount as may be due for any defense costs or award
arising out of this suit. Mr. Brana originally delivered 100,000 shares of CDL
common stock to the Company as collateral for the note which was due on December
1, 2000. Because of the increased costs in defending the suit Mr. Brana
delivered an additional 50,000 shares of CDL common stock to the Company and the
Company agreed to extend the due date until December 1, 2002. In April 1999 a
motion for summary judgement was filed and denied by the Court in December 1999.
The plaintiff subsequently filed a Third Amended Complaint for breach of
contract and additional claims for quantum meruit. The parties are presently
participating in court-ordered non-binding mediation in an attempt to resolve
this litigation which extends the time to respond to the Third Amended Complaint
until thirty days after completion of the final mediation session, subject to
the Court approval. Mediation sessions are scheduled through March 2000. Due
to the continuing legal costs in defending this suit, Mr. Brana has agreed to
deliver 200,000 additional shares of CDL common stock to the Company on or
before May 31, 2000. The Company does not believe that an adverse determination
in this matter would result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position or results of operations of the Company.
The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time, parties to litigation
arising in the normal course of their business, most of which involves claims
for personal injury and property damage incurred in connection with their
operations. Management believes that none of these actions, including the above
action, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results
of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Sales Agency Agreements The Company has entered into sales agency  agreements with  independent
contractors with varying terms to perform courier services on behalf of the
Company. The independent contractors provide marketing and sales services and
the Company provides the resources to perform courier services. In connection
with these transactions the Company retains from the independent contractors a
fee for services rendered of approximately 10% of revenues. The profit on these
sales net of the Company fees for its services are remitted back to the
independent contractors as payment for marketing and sales services rendered.
Sales agency charges totaled $34 million, $42 million and $47 million in
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Earn-Outs
Certain of the companies acquired by CDL are eligible to earn additional
amounts, consisting of a combination of cash and notes payable, as adjustments
to the purchase prices paid for those companies. At December 31, 1999, the
Company had recorded an accrual for the estimated earn-outs for Goldwings,
Westwind and Skycab in the amounts of $520,000, $700,000 and $100,000, in
connection with recording their respective acquisitions. Due to applicable
targets not being met, the earnouts for Everready  Express and Manteca
Enterprises were reduced by $242,000 and $679,000, respectively. The Company
recorded an increase in purchase price for a settlement reached in connection
with the acquisition of Metro Courier in the amount of $167,000.
14   Stock Option Plans     The Company has two stock option plans under which employees and
independent directors may be granted options to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock at or above the fair market value at the date of grant.
Options generally vest in one to four years and expire in 10 years.
Employee Stock compensation Program      In September 1995, the Board of Directors adopted, and the stockholders
of the Company approved the Company Employee Stock Compensation Program the
Employee Stock Compensation Program. The Employee Stock Compensation Program
authorizes the granting of incentive stock options, non-qualified supplementary
options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and stock bonus awards to
key employees of the Company, including those employees serving as officers or directors of the Company. The Company initially reserved 1,400,000 shares of
Common Stock for issuance in connection with the Employee Stock Compensation
Program. In June 1998 the Board of Directors adopted and the stockholders of the
Company approved an additional 500,000 shares for issuance under the Employee
Stock Compensation  Program.  The Employee Stock Compensation Program is
administered by a committee of the Board of Directors the Administrators
made up of directors who are disinterested persons. Options and awards granted
under the Employee Stock Compensation Program will have an exercise or payment
price as established by the Administrators provided that the exercise price of
incentive stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the
underlying shares on the date of grant. Unless otherwise specified by the
Administrators, options and awards will vest in four equal installments on the
first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant.
1995 Stock Option Plan for Independent Directors      In September 1995, the Board of Directors adopted, and the stockholders
of the Company approved, the Company 1995 Stock Option Plan for Independent
Directors the Director Plan. The Director Plan authorizes the granting of
non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors of the Company. The
Company has reserved 100,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance in connection
with the Director Plan. The Director Plan is administered by a committee of the
Board of Directors the Committee, none of whom will be eligible to
participate in the Director Plan. The Director Plan provided for an initial
grant of an option to purchase 1,500 shares of Common Stock upon election as a
director of the Company, a second option to purchase 1,000 shares of Common
Stock upon the one-year anniversary of such director election and subsequent
annual options for 500 shares of Common Stock upon the anniversary of each year
of service as a director. In June of 1998 the stockholders of the Company
approved amendments to the Director Plan. The amendments replaced the annual
stock option grants of the original plan with quarterly grants of 1,250 shares
of stock options on the first trading day of each fiscal quarter commencing on
October 1, 1997. In August of 1998 and February of 1999, the Committee approved
further amendments to the Plan. These amendments replaced the time period to
exercise vested options after a participating director has served as a director
for a period of three consecutive years or more. The Director Plan was amended
to provide that in the event any holder, who has served as a director for three
or more consecutive years, shall cease to be a director for any reason,
including removal with or without cause or death or disability, all options to
the extent exercisable at the termination of the director service shall
remain  exercisable  by the holder or his lawful  heirs,  executors or
administrators until the expiration of the ten year period following the date
such options were granted.

-               The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123 and has chosen to continue to
account for stock-based  compensation  using the intrinsic value method.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its stock-based
compensation plans. Pro forma information regarding net income loss and
earnings loss per share is required, and has been determined as if the Company
had accounted for its stock options under the fair value method. The fair value
for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions for 1999, 1998 and 1997.                                 1999        1998        1997

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company pro

Effective April 1, 1998, CDL adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
Employee Purchase Plan which was amended in 1999. The Employee Purchase Plan
permits eligible employees to purchase CDL common stock at 85% of the closing
market price on the last day prior to the commencement or the end of the
purchase period. The Employee Purchase Plan provides for the purchase of up to
500,000 shares of common stock. During 1999, 73,172 shares were issued under the
Employee Purchase Plan.
16   SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION RIGHTS AGREEMENT
On December 27, 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company announced the
declaration of a dividend of one right a Right for each outstanding share of
Common Stock, of the Company held of record at the close of business on January
6, 2000, or issued thereafter and prior to the time at which they separate from
the Common Stock and thereafter pursuant to options and convertible securities
outstanding at the time they separate from the Common Stock. The Rights were
issued pursuant to a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated as of
December 27, 1999, between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, as Rights Agent. Each Right entitles its registered holder to purchase
from the Company, after the Separation Time, one one-hundredth of a share of
Participating Preferred Stock, par value $001 per share, for $2700 the
Exercise Price, subject to adjustment. The holders of Rights will, solely by
reason of their ownership of Rights, have no rights as stockholders of the
Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive
dividends.
The Rights will separate from the Common Stock if any person or group subject
to certain exceptions becomes the beneficial owner of fifteen percent or more
of the Common Stock or any person or group subject to certain exceptions makes
a tender or exchange offer that would result in that person or group
beneficially owning fifteen percent or more of the Common Stock. Upon separation
of the Rights from the Common Stock, each Right other than Rights beneficially
owned by the acquiring person or group, which Rights shall become void will
constitute the right to purchase from the Company that number of shares of
Common Stock of the Company having a market price equal to twice the Exercise
Price for an amount equal to the Exercise Price. In addition, if a person or
group who has acquired beneficial ownership of fifteen percent or more of the
Common Stock controls the board of directors of the Company and the Company
engages in certain business combinations or asset sales, then the holders of the
Rights other than the acquiring person or group will have the right to
purchase common stock of the acquiring company having a market value equal to
two times the Exercise Price.
In certain circumstances, the board of directors may elect to exchange all of
