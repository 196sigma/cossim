Item8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.    
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Datalink Corporation 
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Datalink Corporation as of December31, 2009 and 2008, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December31, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Datalink Corporation as of December31, 2009 and 2008, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
As
discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2009 the Company changed its method of accounting for business combinations. 
We
were not engaged to examine management assessment of the effectiveness of Datalink Corporation internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, included in this annual
report on Form10-K, under the caption Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon. s/

DATALINK CORPORATION      NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:  Description of Business:  Datalink Corporation provides solutions and services that help make data centers more efficient, manageable and responsive to changing
business needs. Focused on mid and large-size companies, Datalink helps companies migrate from physical to virtual data centers, ensure data protection and optimize enterprise networks. We
derive our revenues principally from designing, installing and supporting data center solutions. Our solutions and services span three practices: consolidation and virtualization of data center
infrastructures; enhanced data protection; and advanced network infrastructures. We are frequently engaged to provide assistance in the installation of
data center solutions and to provide support services subsequent to the installation. Occasionally, we are engaged for consulting services.  Reclassifications:  Based on internal reviews of our accounting policies and financial presentation, we have reclassified certain prior-year
amounts in our 2008 balance sheet to conform to the 2009 balance sheet presentation. 
We
have made a classification change relating to customer prepayments for orders that we have shipped but not installed. At December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, we had
customer prepayments for orders that we have shipped but not installed of $40million and $61million. In the past, we had included customer prepayments in accounts receivable. Our new
policy is to classify customer prepayments as its own current liability. Accordingly, we have changed our previously reported December31, 2008 balance sheet to reflect this reclassification.
This reclassification increased both current assets and current liabilities proportionally and therefore did not change our previously reported working capital. 
We
reclassified on our balance sheet the portion of deferred costs and revenues of customer support contracts greater than twelve months in duration as non-current assets and
liabilities, respectively. We previously reported all of our customer support contracts and related costs in current liabilities and current assets, respectively. Accordingly, we have changed our
previously reported December31, 2008 balance sheet to reflect this reclassification. At December31, 2008, deferred costs and revenues of customer support contracts greater than twelve
months in duration were $106million and $133million, respectively. This reclassification had no effect on previously reported total assets or total liabilities, operating income, net
earnings or net cash flows from operating activities.  Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards:  In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which changes how we account for business acquisitions occurring after
January1, 2009. The guidance requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the
acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this guidance have, among other things,
impacted the determination of acquisition date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination including contingent consideration; required us to exclude transaction costs from
acquisition accounting for acquisitions occurring after January1, 2009; and changed accounting practices for acquired contingencies, acquisition related restructuring costs,
in-process research and 
37 
development,
indemnification assets and tax benefits. This guidance was effective for us beginning January1, 2009. In
April 2009, the FASB issued accounting guidance regarding disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments including the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate
fair value. This guidance increases the frequency of certain fair value disclosures from annual to quarterly. This guidance was effective in 2009. 
In
May 2009, the FASB updated its accounting guidance regarding subsequent events, establishing principles and requirements for disclosures concerning subsequent events. In particular,
it sets for the period after the balance sheet date during which management is required to evaluate events or transactions that have or may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements; the circumstances under which we must recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that we must make
about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. This updated guidance was effective for the current reporting period. 
In
October 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic605 Revenue  Revenue Arrangements. This update addresses the
accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit. This guidance establishes a selling
price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: avendor-specific objective evidence; bthird-party evidence; or cestimates. This
guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires allocation of arrangement consideration at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price
method. In addition, this guidance significantly expands required disclosures for a vendor multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This guidance is effective prospectively for revenue
arrangements entered into or materially modified in
fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010 and early adoption is permitted. A company may elect, but is not required, to adopt this guidance retrospectively for all prior periods. We are
currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this update will have, if any, on our financial statements. 
In
October 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic985 SoftwareCertain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. This update
excludes from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non-software components that function together to deliver a product essential functionality. This guidance is
effective for us on January1, 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this update will have, if any, on our financial statements.  Cash and Cash Equivalents:  Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less, are readily convertible to
cash and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. We maintain our cash in bank deposit and money market accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced
any losses in such accounts.  Short-Term Investments:  Our short term investments consist principally of certificates of deposits. We categorize these investments as not
available-for-sale securities and record them at fair market value. We classify investments with maturities of 90days or less from the date of purchase as cash
equivalents; investments with maturities of greater than 90days from the date of purchase but less than one year generally as short-term investments; and investments with
maturities of greater than one year from the date of purchase generally as long-term investments. 
38  Accounts Receivable, net:  We carry trade receivables at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all
outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer financial
condition and credit history and current economic conditions. We write off trade receivables when deemed uncollectible. We record recoveries of trade receivables previously written off when received. We
recorded accounts receivable net of the reserve for doubtful accounts of $629,000 and $199,000 at December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Concentration of Credit Risk:  We had no customers that comprised more than 10% of our sales in 2009, 2008 or 2007.  Inventories:  Inventories, including inventories shipped but not installed, principally consist of data storage products and components, valued at
the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO method. We reduced inventories for obsolete and slow moving reserves by $122,000 and $100,000
at December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Property and Equipment:  We state property and equipment, including purchased software, at cost. We provide for depreciation and amortization by charges to
operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 2 to
10years. We amortize leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the underlying lease term. We remove the costs and related
accumulated depreciation and amortization on asset disposals from the accounts and include any gain or loss in operating expenses. We capitalize major renewals and betterments, but charge maintenance
and repairs to current operations when incurred.

Goodwill:  We assess the carrying amount of our goodwill for potential impairment annually or more frequently if events or a change in
circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We have only one operating and reporting unit that earns revenues, incurs expenses and makes available discrete financial information for
review by our chief operations decision maker. Accordingly, we complete our 
39 
goodwill
impairment testing on this single reporting unit. Our measurement date was December31, 2009. 
Testing
for goodwill impairment is a two step process. The first step screens for potential impairment. If there is an indication of possible impairment, we must complete the second step
to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of our market capitalization with the
carrying value of our net assets. If our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the
amount of impairment loss we record, if any. We consider goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in
determining fair value amounts.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:  We perform an impairment test for finite-lived assets and other long-lived assets, such as fixed assets, whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of such assets. We recognize impairment based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value.
We generally measure fair value based on discounted cash flow analyses. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, we identified no triggering events that required us to evaluate the impairment of our
long-lived assets.  Stock Compensation Plans:  We utilize the fair value method of accounting to account for share-based compensation awards. This requires us to measure and
recognize in our statements of operations the expense associated with all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. We use the Black-Scholes model to
determine the fair value of share-based payment awards. Stock-based compensation expense was $15million, $959,000 and $516,000 for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Income Taxes:  We calculate income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, we record
deferred income taxes to reflect the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts using enacted tax
rates for the years in which we expect these items to affect taxable income. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we expect more likely than not
to realize. Income tax expense benefit is the tax payable receivable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Uncertain Tax Positions:  We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions tax contingencies. The first step
evaluates the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that we will sustain the position on audit, including resolution of
related appeals or litigation processes. The second step measures the tax benefit as the largest amount more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We include interest and
penalties for our tax contingencies in income tax expense. At December31, 2009 and 2008, we had no unrecognized tax benefits which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized.  Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that 
40 
affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the reserve for doubtful accounts, reserve for obsolete and slow moving excess inventory and impairment
analysis of goodwill and long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Revenue Recognition:  Revenue Recognition.We realize revenue from the design, installation and support of data center solutions, which may include hardware,
software and
services. We recognize revenue when we have met our obligations for installation or other services and collectability is reasonably assured. 
Product Sales.We sell software and hardware products on both a free-standing basis without any services and as data center solutions
bundled with its installation and configuration services bundled arrangements. Product Sales Without Service.If we sell a software or hardware product and do not provide any installation or configuration services
with it, we
recognize the product revenues upon shipment. 
Product Sales With Service.If we sell a bundled arrangement, then we defer recognizing any revenue on it until we finish its
installation and/or
configuration work. We account for the hardware, software and service elements of our bundled arrangements by applying the completed contract method. Factors we have considered in applying the
completed contract method of accounting include ithe relatively short duration of our contracts, iithe difficulty of estimating our revenues on a
percentage-of-completion method and iiiour use of acceptance provisions on larger bundled arrangements. 
Service Sales.In addition to installation and configuration services that are part of our bundled arrangements described above, our
service sales
include customer support contracts and consulting services. On our balance sheet, deferred revenue relates to service sales for which our customer has paid us or has been invoiced but for which we
have not yet performed the applicable services. 
Customer Support Contracts.When we sell hardware and/or software products to our customers, we enter into service contracts with them.
These
contracts are support service agreements. A majority of the time, our internal support desk first assists the customer by performing an initial technical triage to determine the source of the problem
and whether we can direct the customer on how to fix the problem. If we cannot solve the problem, we transfer the customer to the manufacturer or its designated service organization. 
When
we do not provide first call assistance, usually because the manufacturer has not authorized us to do so, our customers call the manufacturer or its designated service
organization directly for both the initial technical triage and any follow-up assistance. If the customer calls us first, we transfer the customer to the third party. 
In
both scenarios above, we purchase third party support contracts from the manufacturers for their services. In accordance with our agreements, and consistent with standard industry
practice, we prepay the third party based on its list price for maintenance on the specific hardware or software products we have sold, less our negotiated discounts with the third party. Terms are
generally net 30days. If we provide the initial first call services our discounts off of list price are more substantial. In all cases, we are the primary obligor in the transaction. The
customer ultimately holds us responsible for fulfillment of the third party support contracts and we bear credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the customer. 
We
report customer support contract revenue on a gross basis as there are sufficient indicators in accumulation that we should be reporting these revenues on a gross basis in accordance
with ASC 
41  Topic605-45,
Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principle versus Net as an Agent formerly EITF No99-19. We usually
present quotations for maintenance arrangements to our customers without differentiating as to whether we, or a third party, are providing the service. Accordingly, we are, from our customers'
perspectives, the primary obligor on our maintenance arrangements. We directly enter into the agreements with our customers to provide maintenance services. In all cases, we set the price to our
customer for the maintenance arrangements, whether or not we provide our first call services, and bill our customers for the maintenance arrangement. We owe various third parties regardless of whether
we collect from our customer. We are also contractually obligated to provide or arrange to provide these underlying support services to our customers in the unlikely event that the manufacturer or its
designated service organization, fails to perform according to the terms of our contract. When
we sell a service contract as part of a bundled arrangement, we use vendor specific objective evidence to allocate revenue to the service contract element. In all cases, we defer
revenues and direct costs resulting from our service contracts and amortize them into operations over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve months. We defer customer support costs
under FTB 90-1 ASC 310 and the FAQs under SAB101 and SAB104. The deferred costs we capitalize consist of direct and incremental costs we prepay to third parties for
direct support to our customers under our contract terms. We defer our customer support contract revenues and their related costs because significant obligations remain after contract execution. For
example, we provide routine help desk assistance to our customers and assist them in contacting our vendors for additional support services. 
Consulting Services.Some of our customers engage us to analyze their existing data center architectures and offer our recommendations.
Other
customers engage us to assist them on-site with extended data center infrastructure projects, to support their data center environments and to help with long-term data center
design challenges. For these types of consulting services that do not include the sale of hardware or software products, we recognize revenues as we perform these services.  Net Earnings Per Share:  We compute basic net earnings per share using the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share include
the effect of common stock equivalents, if any, for each period. Diluted per share amounts assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential 
42 
common
stock instruments unless their effect is anti-dilutive. The following table computes basic and diluted net earnings per share:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  At December31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying values of current financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, short
term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other current assets, accrued liabilities, other current liabilities and notes due to seller of acquired business approximated their market
values, based on the short-term maturities of these instruments.  Fair Value Measurement:  We adopted the new guidance related to fair value measurements on January1, 2008. Fair value is the price a party would receive
to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. We use a three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs: Level1Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at
the measurement date.  
Level2Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices
included in Level1, either directly or indirectly. 
43   Level3Significant unobservable inputs that we cannot corroborate by observable market data and thus
reflect the use of significant management judgment. We generally determine these values using pricing models based on assumptions our management believes other market participants would make. The
fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair
value hierarchy, we determine the fair value measurement based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a
particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The following table sets forth, by level
within the fair value hierarchy, the accounting of our financial assets and/or liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2009 according to the valuation techniques we
used to determine their fair values.

2.Acquisitions  Networking Solutions Division of Cross Telecom  On October1, 2009, we acquired the networking solutions division of Minneapolis-based Cross Telecom Cross, which
qualified as a business combination. We completed an asset purchase of $20million paid in cash. Simultaneously, Cross entered into a services agreement with us to purchase at least
$18million of networking products and services from us over the next three years. Cross has agreed to pay any shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount.
We believe that the revenue targets will be met and accordingly the reverse earnout was determined to have no fair value at the date of this business combination. 
In
connection with this acquisition, we allocated the total purchase consideration to the net assets acquired, including finite lived intangible assets, based on their respective fair
values at the acquisition date. 
We
paid a premium for the net tangible and identified intangible assets i.e.goodwill acquired in the acquisition over their fair value because we believe this acquisition will
add to our expertise in designing, implementing and managing sophisticated storage, backup and recovery infrastructures. 
The
following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired: 
in thousands  Assets acquired and their fair values Property, plant equipment 47 Finite-lived intangibles 534 Goodwill 1,419 Net purchase price 2,000 
We
allocated the purchase price for the Cross acquisition primarily by comparing our estimated cost to build the assets acquired against purchasing them. This enabled us to determine the
allocation between finite lived intangibles and goodwill. The finite lived intangibles, which consisted of the 
44  services
agreement and certifications have estimated lives of four and two years, respectively, and we are amortizing them using the straight line method see Note3. The goodwill we may
deduct for tax purposes over a 15year period.  Reseller Business of Incentra,LLC  On December17, 2009, we acquired the reseller business of Incentra, which designs, procures, implements and supports data
center solutions composed of technologies including storage, networking, security and servers from leading manufacturers. We did not acquire Incentra managed services portfolio and related
operations. We accomplished the acquisition through the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Incentra reseller business pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement. 
Under
the Asset Purchase Agreement, we paid Incentra $138million. We paid $88million at closing in cash, of which we held back $440,000 as security for certain
indemnification obligations of Incentra. In addition, we paid Incentra $50million for the working capital associated with Incentra reseller business through the delivery of
$20million in cash and a $30million secured promissory note due by
March31, 2010. The $50million working capital payment is subject to post-closing adjustments, either upward or downward, in connection with the amount, if any, that
Incentra actual working capital at the closing date was greater or less than $50million. We will make any downward adjustments on a dollar-for-dollar basis. We will
make any upward adjustments in the amount of $050 for each dollar by which actual working capital at closing, after taking into account the collection of accounts receivable and the payment of
accounts payable through June30, 2010, exceeded $50million. The promissory note is secured by the assets we purchased under the Asset Purchase Agreement. 
We
allocated of the purchase price for Incentra primarily using a discounted cash flow approach with respect to identified intangible assets and goodwill. We based this approach upon our
estimates of future cash flows from the acquired assets and liabilities and utilized a discount rate consistent with the inherent risk associated with the acquired assets and liabilities assumed. 
In
connection with this acquisition, we allocated the total purchase consideration to the net assets acquired, including finite lived intangible assets, based on their respective fair
values at the acquisition date, resulting in goodwill of approximately $42million which will be deductible for tax purposes over a 15year period. We paid a premium over the fair value
of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired i.e.goodwill because we believe this acquisition expands our regional presence and customer portfolio and enables us to provide
our customers with complete data center solutions. We anticipate operational synergies and efficiencies through combined general and administrative and corporate functions.

The
finite lived intangibles which consisted of trademarks, order backlog and customer relationships have estimated lives of three years, one year and eight years, respectively, and we
are amortizing them using the straight line method see Note3. 
Integration
costs for 2009 include salaries, benefits, retention bonuses and severances of exiting employees, some of whom assisted with the initial integration of Incentra. In addition,
transaction costs for 2009 include legal, audit and other outside service fees necessary to complete our acquisition of Incentra, which were expensed. Total integration and transaction costs were
$10million during 2009.  Midrange Computer SystemsInc.  On January31, 2007, we acquired MCSI, a storage consulting, solutions and service provider based in Chicago, Illinois. We
believe the acquisition strengthened our presence in the existing regional markets and expanded our reach into a number of then key new regional markets. We paid a purchase price of approximately
$143million for MCSI, consisting of $50million cash and 1,163,384 shares of our common stock. In
connection with this acquisition, we allocated the total purchase consideration to the net assets and liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their
respective fair values at the acquisition date, resulting in goodwill of approximately $122million which is non-deductible for 
46  income
tax purposes. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired: 
in thousands  Assets acquired Cash 3,466 Accounts receivable 1,047 Inventory inventory shipped but not installed 3,800 Property, plant equipment 255 Finite-lived intangibles 4,338 Goodwill 12,248 Other assets 94 Total assets acquired 25,248 Liabilities assumed Accounts payable 8,304 Deferred maintenance contracts, net 398 Accrued liabilities 462 Deferred tax liability obligations 1,824 Total liabilities assumed 10,988 Net purchase price 14,260

The
finite lived intangibles which consisted of customer relationships and backlog have estimated lives of six years and two months, respectively and we are amortizing them using the
straight line method see Note3. 
Integration
expenses, including the salaries, benefits, retention bonuses and severances of MCSI employees, some of whom assisted with the initial integration but were ultimately not
retained by us, were $442,000 for 2007. 
The
pro forma unaudited results of operations assuming consummation of our Incentra acquisition as of January1, 2008 and our MCSI acquisition as of January1, 2007, and
excluding any pro forma information for the Cross acquisition as that pro forma impact was not significant, are as follows:

Amortization
expense related to finite-lived intangible assets for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $843,000, $711,000 and $727,000, respectively. Amortization expense in 2009 relates primarily
to our acquisitions of MCSI in January 2007, the networking solutions division of Cross in October 2009 and the reseller business of Incentra in December 2009. Amortization expense in 2008 and 2007
relates primarily to our acquisition of MCSI in January 2007. The finite lived intangibles we acquired related to the reseller business of Incentra consisted of trademarks, order backlog and customer
relationships and have estimated lives of three years, one year and 8years, respectively. The finite lived intangibles we acquired related to the networking solutions division of Cross
consisted of the services agreement and 
48  certifications
and have estimated lives of four years and 2years, respectively. The finite lived intangibles we acquired related to our acquisition of MCSI consisted of customer relationships
and backlog and have estimated lives of six years and two months, respectively. We are amortizing all finite lived intangibles using the straight line method. Expected amortization in each of the next
five years is as follows:

2008 in thousands Current income tax expense 109 2,366 Deferred tax expense benefit 88 130 Income tax expense 197 2,236 
In
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. As of
December31, 2009, we have federal net operating carryforwards of approximately $46million which will expire in 2028. As of December31, 2009, we have state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $71million, which are available to offset future state taxable income. If not used, the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between 2013 and
2028. For 2009 and 2007, respectively, we recorded approximately $1,300 and $104,000 to equity for tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options. For 2008, we recorded approximately
$13,000 to equity for tax expenses associated with the exercise of stock options. In future periods of taxable earnings, we expect to report an income tax provision using an effective tax rate of
approximately 38% to 40%. 
50    5.Lease Commitments: 
Our corporate headquarters including our principal technical and support services operations, are located in an office and warehouse facility in Chanhassen,
Minnesota. As of December31, 2009, our other 24 locations, housing sales and technical staff, are small to medium sized offices. We have regional hubs located in the Northeast, South, Mid
Central, North Central and West.

In
December 2004, we agreed to sublease approximately 55,000 of the 104,000 square feet we then occupied as our corporate headquarters in Chanhassen, Minnesota. The initial sublease term
is co-terminal with the original lease ending in April 2012. The sublessee pays us rent ranging from approximately $55,000 per month at the beginning of the term to approximately $60,000
per month by the end of the term. The rent includes the costs of common area management, common systems repairs, real estate taxes and standard utilities. Total
rent expense, net of sublease income of $663,000, $663,000 and $663,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, is as follows:

6.Employee Benefit Plan: 
We have a defined contribution retirement plan for eligible employees. Employees may contribute up to 15% of their pretax compensation to the 401k portion of
the plan. Since April 2006, we have matched 50% of an employee contribution up to the first 6% of an employee eligible compensation. The cost of our contributions to the 401k portion of the plan
for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $640,000, $568,000 and $554,000, respectively. 
7.Stockholders' Equity:  Stock Compensation Plans:  In May 2009, our shareholders approved the Datalink 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan replaced our existing
1999 Incentive Compensation Plan 1999 Plan, which terminated according to its terms on June11, 2009. We reserved up to 1,000,000 initial shares of our common stock for possible issuance
under the 2009 Plan. Awards under the 2009 Plan may consist of options non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, or SARs, restricted stock units, performance
units, dividend equivalents, annual incentive awards and other share-based awards as determined by our Compensation Committee. The terms and conditions of each award are set in an 
51 
award
agreement as determined by the Compensation Committee. As of December31, 2009, there were 293,750 shares available for grant under the 2009 Plan. In
May 2001, we reserved an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to our 1999 Plan. The terms of the 1999 Plan allowed for a variety of awards including
incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, non-vested stock, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, phantom shares and
other share based awards, as determined by the Compensation Committee. As of June11, 2009, this plan terminated according to its terms. As of December31, 2009, there were no shares
available for grant under the 1999 Plan. 
In
August 2000, we adopted our 2000 Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan. The terms of the Director Plan as most recently amended in May 2007, allow for stock option grants
to non-employee members of the Board of Directors. We have reserved 550,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to the Director Plan, 198,064 of which were available for grant as
of December31, 2009.  Non-Vested Stock Plans:  On December14, 2009, we awarded 201,250 shares of non-vested stock to senior management and managers. The grants
vest upon the achievement of our predetermined earnings from operations objective for 2010 as approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, the individual employee must remain employed by us
through December31, 2011. We will amortize the $767,000 fair value of the non-vested shares
over a two-year period beginning on January1, 2010 if we reasonably believe that we will meet our earnings from operations objective for 2010. 
On
December17, 2009, we awarded 127,500 shares of non-vested stock to senior management and managers that we hired in conjunction with our acquisition of the Incentra
reseller business. The grant vests over four years with one-fourth vesting each year if the individual is still employed by us. During the vesting period, the individual has voting rights
and the right to receive dividends. However, we will retain the dividends until the shares have vested. The shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until they
have vested. We are amortizing the $501,000 fair value of the non-vested shares on the date of grant ratably over the four-year vesting period. Unrecognized compensation
expense related to the non-vested stock grants was $496,000 as of December31, 2009. For 2009, compensation expense related to these non-vested stock grants was $5,000. 
On
December17, 2009, we awarded 30,000 shares on non-vested stock to certain employees. The grant vests over three years with one-third vesting each year
if the individual is still employed by us. During the vesting period, the individual has voting rights and the right to receive dividends. However, we will retain the dividends until the shares have
vested. The shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until they have vested. We are amortizing the $118,000 fair value of the non-vested shares on the
date of grant ratably over the three-year vesting period. Unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested stock grants was $116,000 as of December31, 2009.
For 2009, compensation expense related to these non-vested stock grants was $2,000. 
In
February 2007, we awarded 75,000 shares of non-vested stock to an executive. The grant vests over four years, with 50percent after year two, 25percent
after year three and 25percent after year four if the executive is still employed by us. During the vesting period, the executive has voting rights and the right to receive dividends. However,
we will retain the dividends until the shares have vested. The shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until they vest. We are amortizing the $665,000 value of
the restricted shares on the date of grant ratably over the four year vesting period. Unrecognized compensation expense related to the restricted stock grant was $187,000, $353,000 and $520,000 at
December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For the years 
52  ended
December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, compensation expense related to this non-vested stock grant was $166,000, $166,000 and $146,000, respectively. 
In
March and April 2007, respectively, we awarded 120,000 and 86,000 shares of non-vested stock to senior management and managers and gave our CEO the authority to grant an
additional 7,750 restricted shares of our common stock to yet to be named key employees. Partial vesting of these restricted stock awards was based upon the achievement of our predetermined earnings
from operations objective for 2007 as approved by our Board of Directors the 2007
Objective. We did not meet the 2007 Objective. Based on the award grant conditions, one-third of the awards expired on February6, 2008, the date we publicly announced our 2007
financial results. In addition, we did not exceed our earnings from operations objectives for 2008 and 2009 to make up the difference for the shortfall in 2007. Therefore, based on the award grant
conditions, the remaining two-thirds of the awards expired on March10, 2010, the date we publicly announced our 2009 financial results. Accordingly, we did not recognize any
compensation expense related to these canceled, non-vested stock grants except for those shares awarded to our former president and chief executive officer. In accordance with the
severance agreement for our former president and chief executive officer, we vested the 30,000 shares he was awarded with related compensation expense in 2009 of $240,000. 
In
December 2007, we awarded 250,000 shares of non-vested stock to certain employees. The non-vested stock vests over three years with one-third
vesting each year if the individual is still employed by us. During the vesting period, the individual has voting rights and the right to receive dividends. However, we will retain the dividends until
the shares have vested. The shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until they have vested. We are amortizing the $902,000 fair value of the
non-vested shares on the date of grant ratably over the three-year vesting period. Unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested stock grants was
$250,000, $667,000 and $893,000 at December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, compensation expense related to these non-vested stock
grants was $345,000, $226,000 and $10,000.

over four years with one-fourth vesting each year if the individual is still employed by us. During the vesting period, the individual has voting rights and the right to receive dividends.
However, we will retain the dividends until the shares have vested. The shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until they have vested. We are amortizing the
$926,000 fair value of the non-vested shares on the date of grant ratably over the four year vesting period. Unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested stock
grants was $23,000, $266,000 and $509,000 at December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, compensation expense related to these non-vested

Stock Options:  In December 2009, we awarded 25,000 stock options to one of our managers. The stock options vest over three years with
one-third vesting each year if the individual is still employed by us. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The weighted-average fair
value per option at the date of grant was $235. We estimated the fair value for the stock option grant with the following average assumptions: 
2009  Risk-free interest rates 27 Expected dividend yield 0 Expected volatility factor 67 Expected option holding period 6years 
In
July 2009, we awarded 450,000 stock options to our new president and chief executive officer. The stock options vest 25% per year over a term of four years, provided he continues
employment with us through each relevant vesting date. Unvested stock options will immediately vest upon a change of control of us as defined in his employment agreement but only if he iis
continuously employed to the date of the change of control, iithe change of control price as defined in the employment agreement exceeds $350 per share, iiiour compensation
committee authorizes the acceleration and vesting of the options and ivsuch acceleration and vesting will not cause the option to be subject to the adverse consequences described in
Section409A of the Internal Revenue Code. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The weighted-average fair value per option at the date of
grant was $215. We estimated the fair value for the stock option grant with the following weighted average assumptions: 
2009  Risk-free interest rates 28 Expected dividend yield 0 Expected volatility factor 66 Expected option holding period 6years 
54 
In
February 2008, we awarded 200,000 and 115,000 stock options to executive officers and managers, respectively. The stock options vest over three years with one-third
vesting each year if the individual is still employed by us. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The weighted-average fair values per option at
the date of grant were $252. We estimated the fair value for the stock option grants with the following weighted average assumptions: 
2008  Risk-free interest rates 29 Expected dividend yield 0 Expected volatility factor 71 Expected option holding period 6years 
We
had no stock option grants in 2007. 
The
risk-free rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of our stock options. Expected volatility is based on the historical
volatility of our share price for the period prior to the option grant equivalent to the expected holding period of the options. The expected holding period and dividend yield are based on historical
experience. Total stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $328,000 at December31, 2009. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was
$10million at December31, 2009.

Item2.Controls and Procedures     aEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer principal executive officer and our Chief Financial Officer principal
financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule13a-15b under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Based on their review of our disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and

officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specific in the
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  bManagement Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based
on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2009. 
This
Annual Report on Form10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial

has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
