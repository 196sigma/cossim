33 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Assisted Living
Concepts, Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying
index. These consolidated financial statements and the financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002 Successor Company, and the
results of operations and cash flows of the Predecessor Company for the year
ended December31, 2001 and of the Successor Company for each of the years in
the two-year period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for stock options in 2003. signedKPMG LLP Dallas, Texas

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 38 Table of Contents ASSISTED LIVING CONCEPTS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. the Company owns, leases and operates
assisted living residences which provide housing to residents who require
assistance with their daily activities. The Company provides personal care and
support services and makes available routine health care services, as permitted
by applicable law, designed to meet the needs of its residents. Reorganization On October1, 2001, Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. the Company, and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Carriage House Assisted Living, Inc. voluntarily filed
for bankruptcy protection under Chapter11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code. The bankruptcy court gave final approval to the first amended joint plan
of reorganization the Plan on December28, 2001, and the plan became
effective on January1, 2002 the Effective Date. As a result of the
consummation of the Plan, the Company recognized an extraordinary gain on
reorganization of $795million in 2001. The Company held back from the initial issuance of Common Stock and Notes on
the Effective Date, $440,178 of Senior Secured Notes, $166,775 of Junior
Secured Notes and 68,241 shares of Common Stock collectively, the Reserve
to be issued to holders of general unsecured claims at a later date. The total
amount of, and the identities of all of the holders of, the general unsecured
claims were not known as of the Effective Date, either because they were
disputed or they were not made by their holders prior to December19, 2001, the
cutoff date for calculating the Reserve the Cutoff Date. In conjunction
with the refinancing see Note 7, the Senior and Junior Notes held in Reserve
were defeased and the proceeds were distributed in accordance with the Plan.
The shares of New Common Stock held in the Reserve are scheduled to be
distributed pro rata to the general unsecured creditors in 2004. Fresh-start Reporting Upon emergence from Chapter11 proceedings, the Company adopted fresh-start
reporting in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position 90-7, Financial Reporting By Entities in
Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code SOP 90-7. In connection with the
adoption of fresh-start reporting, a new entity has been deemed created for
financial reporting purposes effective December31, 2001. In adopting the requirements of fresh-start reporting as of December31, 2001,
the Company was required to value its assets and liabilities at fair value and
eliminate its accumulated deficit as of December31, 2001. A $328million
reorganization value was determined by the Company with the assistance of
financial advisors in reliance upon various valuation methods, including
discounted projected cash flow analysis and other applicable ratios and
economic industry information relevant to the operation of the Company and
through negotiations with various creditor parties in interest. Net
fresh-start adjustments totaling $1193million were charged to the statement
of operations. The adjustments included a $1109million write-down of
property and equipment. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Predecessor Company for the year ended December31, 2001, and the Successor
Company as of December31, 2002 and 2003 and the years ended December31, 2002
and 2003. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash equivalents of $6,447,000 and $210,000 at December31, 2002 and 2003,
respectively, consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less at the date of purchase. Any investments in marketable
securities are stated at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses
included as accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity.
Interest income is recognized when earned. As of December31, 2002 and 2003,
the company had no investments in marketable securities. 39 Table of Contents Escrow Deposits Under certain mortgage and loan agreements, the Company is required to make
escrow deposits for taxes, insurance, and replacement or repair of property
assets. Escrow deposits were $21million and $33million at December31,
2002 and 2003. Other Current Assets The Companys other current assets consist of the following as of December31

Leases The Company determines the classification of its leases as either operating or
capital at their inception. The Company re-evaluates such classification
whenever circumstances or events occur that require the reevaluation of the
leases. The
Predecessor and Successor Companies accounted for arrangements entered into under sale and
leaseback agreements pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFASNo98, Accounting for Leases. For transactions that qualify as sales
and operating leases, a sale is recognized and the asset is removed from the
books. For transactions that qualify as sales and capital leases, the sale is
recognized, but the asset remains on the books and a capital lease obligation
is recorded. Transactions that do not qualify for sales treatment are treated
as financing transactions. In the case of financing transactions, the asset
remains on the books and a finance obligation is recorded as part of long-term
debt. Losses on sale and leaseback agreements are recognized at the time of the
transaction absent indication that the sales price is not representative of
fair value. Gains are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the
initial term of the lease. In accordance with fresh-start reporting, such gains
were eliminated from the Predecessor Companys books as of the Effective date. All of the Companys leases contain various provisions for annual increases in
rent, or rent escalators. Certain of these leases contain rent escalators with
future minimum annual rent increases that are not considered contingent rents.
The total amount of the rent payments under such leases with non-contingent
rent escalators is being charged to expense on the straight-line method over
the term of the leases. The Company records a deferred credit, included in
other liabilities, to reflect the excess of rent expense over cash payments
which is subsequently reduced in the later years as the cash payments exceed
the rent expense. Deferred rent credits at December31, 2003 totaled $520,000. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciation is computed over
the assets estimated useful lives on the straight-line basis as follows   
Predecessor
Successor   
Company
Company   Buildings and building improvements
40 years
35 to 40 years
Furniture and equipment
3 to 7 years
3 to 7 years
Equipment under capital lease is recorded at the net present value of the
future minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease. Amortization of
equipment under capital lease is provided using the straight-line method over
the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life. As of the Effective Date, the Successor Company adjusted its property, plant
and equipment to estimated fair value in conjunction with the implementation of
fresh-start reporting. The Successor Company maintains the same policies
concerning transactions affecting property and equipment. 40 Table of Contents The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever facts and
circumstances indicate an assets carrying value may not be recoverable on an
undiscounted cash flow basis. If an impairment is determined to have occurred,
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the assets carrying amount
exceeds its fair value. Assets the Company intends to dispose of are reported
at the lower of icarrying amount or iifair value less the cost to sell.
The Successor Company has not recognized any impairment losses on property. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and significant
betterments and improvements are capitalized. Goodwill Goodwill of the Predecessor Company consisted of costs in excess of the fair
value of the net assets acquired in purchase transactions as of the date of
acquisition and was being amortized over periods ranging between 15 and 20
years on a straight-line basis. In accordance with fresh-start reporting, the
Predecessor Companys goodwill was eliminated as of the Effective Date. Deferred Financing Costs Financing costs related to the issuance of debt are capitalized as other assets
and amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt using a
method which approximates the effective interest method. As a result of the
refinancing completed in December2003 see Note 7, the Company charged the
$448,000 deferred financing balance related to the extinguished debt to
expense. Deferred financing costs of $36million were recorded related to the
new financing. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes
under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Unfavorable Leases As of the Effective Date, the Successor Company revalued its leases in
conjunction with the implementation of fresh-start reporting. Amortization of
unfavorable leases is computed using the straight-line method and credited to
rent expense over the life of the respective leases. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when services are rendered and consists of residents
fees for basic housing and support services and fees associated with additional
services such as routine health care and personalized assistance on a fee for
service basis. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded each period as an
expense to the consolidated statements of operations. The Company utilizes the
Aging Method to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
This method is based upon applying estimated standard allowance requirement
percentages to each accounts receivable aging category. The Company has
developed estimated standard allowance requirement percentages by utilizing our
understanding of the nature and collectibility of receivables in the various
aging categories and the various segments of our business. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is determined utilizing the aging method described above
while also considering accounts specifically identified as uncollectible and
other factors. Classification of Expenses Residence operating expenses exclude all expenses associated with the Companys
corporate home office or support functions, which have been classified as
corporate general and administrative expense. 41 Table of Contents Net Income Loss Per Common Share Basic earnings per share EPSis calculated using net income loss
attributable to common shares divided by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated in periods with
net income using income attributable to common shares divided by the weighted
average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares
outstanding for the period. The weighted average common shares used for basic
net income lossper common share was 17,121,000 for the year ended December
31, 2001 and 6,500,000 for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2003. The
effect of stock options and other potentially dilutive shares for the years
ended December31, 2001 and 2002 is antidilutive and therefore is excluded from
the calculation. The effect of dilutive stock options using the treasury stock
method added 170,626 shares for the year ended December31, 2003. Pursuant to fresh-start accounting, common stock was adjusted to reflect the
capitalization of the Successor Company in accordance with the Plan. Segment Reporting Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement FASBof Financial Accounting
Standards SFASNo131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information requires public enterprises to report certain information
about their operating segments in a complete set of financial statements to
shareholders. It also requires reporting of certain enterprise-wide information
about the Companys products and services, its activities in different
geographic areas, and its reliance on major customers. The basis for
determining the Companys operating segments is the manner in which management
operates the business. The Company has no foreign operations and no customers
which provide over 10percent of gross revenue. The Company reviews operating
results at the residence level; it also meets the aggregation criteria in order
to report the results as one business segment. Use of Estimates The Company has made certain estimates and assumptions relating to the
reporting of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period to prepare these financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include
professional liability, workers compensation, fresh-start accounting
adjustments, the evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment, and allowance
for doubtful accounts. Workers Compensation and Professional Liability The Company utilizes third-party insurance for losses and liabilities
associated with workers compensation and professional liability claims subject
to deductible and retention levels see Notes 11 and 12. Losses up to the
deductible or retention level are accrued based upon the Companys estimates of
the aggregate liability for claims incurred based on Company and industry
experience. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior years financial
statements to conform to the current years presentation. Such
reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net loss or
shareholders equity. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amount approximates fair value
because of the short maturity of those instruments. Long-term debt The fair value of the Companys long term-debt is estimated
based on 1 terms for same or similar debt instruments, or 2 terms of recently
completed transactions of similar nature or terms offered to the Company, or 3
quoted market rates. 42 Table of Contents The estimated fair values of the Companys long-term debt in thousands is as

Stock-based Compensation The Companys stock-based compensation plans are described in Note 10.
Previously, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation plans under the
recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB No25 and related interpretations. No
stock-based employee compensation expense for stock options was reflected in
Net Income Loss previous to April1, 2003, as all stock options granted under
those plans had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. Effective January1, 2003, the
Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and recognizes compensation expense
according to the prospective transition method under SFAS No148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Under this method
the Company expenses the fair value of all new stock options granted after
January1, 2003. The following table illustrates the effect on net income
lossand earnings per share had the company applied the fair value accounting
method to all of the Companys stock option grants.

Reclassification of Assets Held for Sale The proposed sale of nine South Carolina properties was terminated in May2003
due to the purchasers inability to obtain suitable financing. The Company
discontinued marketing the properties at that time. The transfer of the assets
held for sale to assets held for use did not result in any significant gain or
loss. 2. Cash The Companys cash and cash equivalents consist of the following as of

The Company has five Oregon leases the Oregon Leases where the lessor in
each case obtained funding through the sale of bonds issued by the state of
Oregon, Housing and Community Services Department OHCS. In connection with
the Oregon Leases, the Company entered into Lease Approval Agreements with
OHCS and the lessor, pursuant to which the Company is obligated to comply with
the terms and conditions of certain regulatory agreements to which the lessor
is a party see Note 7. The leases, which have fixed terms of 10years, have
been accounted for as operating leases. Aggregate deposits on these residences
as of December31, 2003 totaled $90,000, which are reflected in other assets.
The Company previously had six Oregon Leases and terminated one of these leases
effective December1, 2001 in accordance with the Plan. The lessor of this
property filed a claim against the Company in the bankruptcy proceedings
regarding the early termination of this lease. The claim was approved by the
Court and resulted in the issuance of $90,502 of Senior Notes, $34,290 of
Junior Notes and 14,031 shares of common stock to this lessor. In June1999, the Company amended all of its 37 leases with LTC. These
amendments included provisions to eliminate future minimum annual rent
increases, or rent escalators, that were not deemed to be contingent rents.
Because of the rent escalators, prior to the amendments, the Company accounted
for rent expense related to such leases on a straight-line basis. From the date
of the amendment forward, the Company has accounted for the amended leases on a
contractual cash payment basis and amortizes the deferred rent balance, at the
date of the amendment, over the remaining initial term of the leases. Those
amendments also redefined the lease renewal option with respect to certain
leases and provided the lessor with the option to declare an event of default
in the event of a change of control under certain circumstances. In addition,
the amendments also provide the Company with the ability, subject to certain
conditions, to sublease or assign its leases with respect to two Washington
residences. see Note 9. The LTC lease agreements provide LTC with the option to exercise certain
remedies, including the termination of the leases, upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default. A change of control of the Company is deemed to be an Event
of Default if certain conditions are not met. A change of control is deemed to
occur if, among other things, iany person, directly or indirectly, is or
becomes the beneficial owner of thirty percent 30% or more of the combined
voting power of the Companys outstanding voting securities, ii 44 Table of Contents the stockholders approve under certain conditions a merger or
consolidation of the Company with another corporation or entity, or iiithe
stockholders approve a plan of liquidation or sale of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Company. However, if upon a change of control, the
surviving entity has a net worth of $75million or more, the change of control
would not constitute an Event of Default. In addition, there are cross default
provisions in the LTC leases. At the same time that the Company entered into
the Master Lease Agreement, it also amended 16 other leases with LTC under
which the renewal rights of certain of those leases are tied together.
Andre Dimitriadis, a member of the Companys Board of Directors, is the
President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of LTC Properties,
Inc. LTC. Mr.Dimitriadis, acting solely as a director of the Company and
not in his capacity as an officer or director of LTC, has orally raised certain
issues regarding compliance with certain of the LTC Leases, which include at
this time, the following: 1 whether there are inconsistencies in the number of
units that constitute the leased property in the Athens, Texas, Greenville,
Texas and Tiffen, Ohio leases, 2 whether the LTC leases require insurance
based on the limits stated in the lease on a per facility basis, and 3 whether
the 4 LTC leases with Carriage House require Carriage House to deliver on an
annual basis audited consolidated financial statements of Carriage House. Mr.
Dimitriadis similarly raised the issue as to whether the Company is required to
obtain licenses for the 2 facilities located in Elkhart, Indiana and Madison,
Indiana as assisted living facilities. Management believes that the Company has meritorious defenses available to it
and/or could exercise its cure rights under the leases to resolve these matters
in the event that LTC were to deliver a notice of default. LTC has not
delivered any notice of default to the Company. However, the Company is
continuing to review and assess these matters internally and no assurance can
be given as to whether the eventual resolution of these issues will be
favorable to the Company. The Company is in the process of obtaining licenses
for the 2 Indiana properties as assisted living facilities which is expected to
be completed by December31, 2004. The Company provides LTC on an annual basis
with annual consolidated audited financial statements of the Company, but not
Carriage House, which was acquired in 1997. Failure to favorably resolve these issues in a manner that avoids an occurrence
of an Event of Default under one or more of the LTC leases would have a
material adverse effect on the Company. This would include, but not be limited
to, creating Events of Default on loan covenants regarding a significant
portion of outstanding indebtedness which, if not cured, would make such
indebtedness become immediately payable. Certain of the Companys leases and loan agreements contain covenants and
cross-default provisions such that a default on one of those instruments could
cause the Company to be in default on one or more other instruments. Pursuant
to certain lease agreements, the Company restricted $10million of cash
balances as additional collateral see Note 4. On January1, 2002 the Company emerged from the proceedings under Chapter11 of
the Bankruptcy Code. The Companys Plan of reorganization included the Company
conveying two facilities to one lender in satisfaction of $59million of debt.
The Company then leased these two properties, one in South Carolina and one in
Pennsylvania, from this lender under a new Master Lease, incorporating two
existing leases as well. Terms under the Master Lease on the South Carolina
facility conveyed to the lender effective January1, 2002, include monthly
payments in the amount of $19,000, $20,000, $21,000 and $21,667 for the years
ended December31, 2002, 2003, 2004 and all years thereafter until the end of
the lease term, respectively. Terms under the Master Lease for the Pennsylvania
facility conveyed effective January1, 2002, include monthly payments of
$22,330 increasing to $23,780 over the next four years, expiring in 2006. The
Companys Plan of reorganization also included the amendment of two existing
leases with the same lender. Such leases were amended under the Master Lease to
provide base rental rates of $2,000 per month with rent escalation clauses
based upon revenue levels with rental rates not to exceed $22,000 per month,
expiring in 2006. As of December31, 2003, future minimum annual lease payments under operating
leases are as follows in thousands

The Oregon Notes are secured by buildings, land, furniture and fixtures of six
Oregon residences. The notes are payable in monthly installments including
interest at effective rates ranging from 74% to 90%. The Washington Bonds are secured by a $71million letter of credit and
buildings, land, furniture and fixtures of the five Washington residences and
had an interest rate of 12% at December31, 2003. The letter of credit expires
in January2005 and has an annual commitment fee of 20%. The Idaho Bonds are secured by a $62million letter of credit and buildings,
land, furniture and fixtures of four Idaho residences and had an interest rate
of 12% at December31, 2003. The letter of credit expires in January2005 and
has an annual commitment fee of 20%. The Ohio Bonds are secured by a $103million letter of credit and buildings,
land, furniture and fixtures of six Ohio residences and had an interest rate of
12% at December31, 2003. The letter of credit expires in January2005 and has
an annual commitment fee of 20%. The HUD insured mortgages include three separate loan agreements entered into
in 2001. The mortgages are each secured by a separate facility in Texas. These
loans mature between July1, 2036 and August1, 2036 and collectively require
monthly principal and interest payments of $47,493. The loans bear interest at
fixed rates ranging from 74% and 76%. At December31, 2003, mortgage loans include three fixed rate loans secured by
seven Texas residences, three Oregon residences and three New Jersey
residences. These loans collectively require monthly principal and interest
payments of $230,000, with balloon 46 Table of Contents payments of $118million, $53million and $72million due at maturity
in May, August and September2008, respectively. These loans bear interest at
fixed rates ranging from 76% to 87%. As of the Effective Date, the Successor Company revalued its long-term debt in
conjunction with the implementation of fresh-start reporting. At December31,
2001, an adjustment of $31million was recorded to reduce long-term debt to
its fair market value. Amortization of this adjustment is computed using the
straight-line method over the life of the corresponding debt. In December2003, the Company refinanced its Senior and Junior Secured Notes
and the secured loan provided by GE Capital collectively Refinanced Debt,
which had a total principal amount of approximately $905million at the
refinancing date. The Senior Notes were due to mature in January2009 and
accrued interest at 10%. The Junior Notes were due to mature in January2012,
bearing interest payable in additional Junior Notes at 8% per annum through
2004 and bearing interest at 12% payable in cash beginning in 2005. The GE
Capital loan had a maturity of December2004, and accrued interest at LIBOR
plus 45% with a minimum interest rate of 8%. Under the terms of the Junior and Senior Indentures, the notes were legally
defeased effective December29, 2003. The Refinanced Debt was retired using proceeds from a new $384million loan
from Red Mortgage Capital New FNMA Loan, as lender for Fannie Mae, a new
$35million term loan and a $15million revolving loan, both from GE Capital
New GE Term Loan and New GE Credit Facility, respectively. The Company
had borrowed $7million of the $15million New GE Credit Facility as of
December31, 2003. The New FNMA Loan has a fixed interest rate of 624%, matures in 10years, has
a 25-year principal amortization and is secured by 24 residences, which serve
as collateral. Both the New GE Term Loan and the New GE Credit Facility mature
in 5years, accrue interest at LIBOR plus 40%, which is calculated based on a
360day year and charged for the actual number of days elapsed, with an
interest rate floor of 575%, and are secured by a collective pool of 30
residences, which serve as collateral. The New GE Term Loan requires monthly
interest payments and principal reductions based on a 25-year principal
amortization schedule, with a balloon payment at maturity. The New GE Credit
Facility has an initial revolving borrowing period of 2years, which may be
extended annually thereafter for three years upon mutual consent by GE Capital
and the Company. During the initial revolving borrowing period, the New GE
Credit Facility requires monthly interest payments, no principal reductions,
and accrues interest on the unused loan availability at a rate of 075% per
year, which is paid quarterly. If the initial revolving borrowing period is
not extended, then the New GE Credit Facility converts from a revolving loan to
a term loan with the same terms as the New GE Term Loan. The New GE Term Loan
and the New GE Credit Facility contain financial covenants that require a
certain level of financial performance for the residences which serve as
collateral for the loan. The new loans from Red Mortgage Capital and GE
Capital were entered into by subsidiaries of the Company and are non-recourse
to the Company, subject to a limited guaranty by the Company. As of December31, 2003, the following annual principal payments are required

The Company has a series of Reimbursement Agreements with U.S. Bank for Letters
of Credit that support certain of our Revenue Bonds Payable. The total amount
of these Letters of Credit was approximately $236million as of December31,
2003. In September2003, the Company entered into an amendment to the
Reimbursement Agreements effective as of June2003, which primarily provided
for the following modifications among other things: 1 release of
approximately $43million of previously restricted cash; 2 standardized and
extended the expiration date of the letters of credit to January2005; 3
amended the annual fees to be 2% of the stated amount of the letters of credit;
4 put in place new financial covenants. The Companys agreements with U.S. Bank contain financial covenants to include
the following: 1 minimum net worth; 2 minimum debt service coverage; 3
minimum liquidity; and 4 minimum earnings. Failure to comply with these
covenants could constitute an event of default, which would allow U.S. Bank to
declare any amounts outstanding under the loan documents to be due and payable.
The agreements also require the Company to deposit $500,000 in cash collateral
with U.S. Bank in the event certain regulatory actions 47 Table of Contents are commenced with respect to the properties securing the Companys obligations
to U.S. Bank. U.S. Bank is required to release such deposits upon satisfactory
resolution of the regulatory action. Approximately $231million of the Companys indebtedness was secured by
letters of credit held by U.S. Bank as of December31, 2003, which in some
cases have termination dates prior to the maturity of the underlying debt. As
such letters of credit expire, in January2005, the Company will need to extend
the current letters of credit, obtain replacement letters of credit, post cash
collateral or refinance the underlying debt. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to extend the current letters of credit or procure
replacement letters of credit from the same or other lending institutions on
terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In the event that the Company is
unable to obtain a replacement letter of credit or provide alternate collateral
prior to the expiration of any of these letters of credit, the Company would be
in default on the underlying debt. In addition to the debt agreements with OHCS related to the six owned
residences in Oregon, the Company has entered into Lease Approval Agreements
with OHCS and the lessor of the Oregon Leases, which obligates the Company to
comply with the terms and conditions of the underlying trust deed relating to
the leased buildings. Under the terms of the OHCS debt agreements, the Company
is required to maintain a capital replacement escrow account to cover expected
capital expenditure requirements for the Oregon Leases and the six OHCS loans.
As a further condition of the OHCS debt agreements, the Company is required to
comply with the terms of certain regulatory agreements which provide, among
other things, that in order to preserve the federal income tax exempt status of
the bonds, the Company is required to lease at least 20% of the units of the
projects to low or moderate income persons as defined in Section 142d of the
Internal Revenue Code. There are additional requirements as to the age and
physical condition of the residents with which the Company must also comply.
Non-compliance with these restrictions may result in an event of default and
cause acceleration of the scheduled repayment. In addition, the terms of certain outstanding indebtedness and certain lease
agreements may restrict the Companys ability to pay cash dividends. 8. Income Taxes The Company had taxable income for both financial reporting and tax return
purposes for the year ended December31, 2003. The Company incurred a loss for
financial reporting and tax return purposes for the years ended December31,
2001 and 2002 and as such, there was no current or deferred tax provision
allocated to the loss from continuing operations, discontinued operations or to
the extraordinary gain on reorganization in those years. The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of tax determined by
applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal rate to income lossfrom
continuing operations as a result of the following items at December31

The increase in the total valuation allowance for the years ended December31,
2001 and 2002 was $181million and $14million respectively. The decrease in
the total valuation allowance for the year ended December31, 2003 was $21
million. At December31, 2003, the Company has approximately $127million of net
operating loss NOLcarryforwards which will expire between 2009 and 2022.
The NOLs are subject to certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which
restricts the utilization of the losses. In addition, any net unrealized
built-in losses resulting from the excess of tax basis over the carrying value
of the Companys assets primarily property and equipment as of the Effective
Date, which are recognized within five years are also subject to these
provisions. Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes limitations on the
utilization of the loss carryforwards and built-in losses after certain changes
of ownership of a loss company. The Company is deemed to be a loss company for
these purposes. Under these provisions, the Companys ability to utilize these
loss carryforwards and built-in losses in the future will generally be subject
to an annual limitation of approximately $16million. The net unrealized
built-in losses were $268million at December31, 2003. No valuation allowance has been provided for currently payable taxes that give
rise to a deferred tax asset subject to carryback claims. There can be no
assurances that the Company will be able to utilize other NOLs or built-in
losses and therefore management has established a 100percent valuation
allowance to offset the remaining net deferred tax asset. Pursuant to SOP 90-7, the income tax benefit, if any, of any realization of the
NOL carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences existing as of the
Effective Date is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. 49 Table of Contents 9. Related Party Transactions Andre Dimitriadis, a member of the Companys Board of Directors, is the
President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of LTC Properties,
Inc. LTC. The Company currently leases 37 properties from LTC. See Note
5. The Company incurred annual lease expense of $90million, $85million
and $87million for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002, and 2003
respectively, pursuant to these leases. 10. Stock Option Plans and Restricted Stock Predecessor Company Prior to January1, 2002, the Company had two stock option plans, which were
cancelled when the Company emerged from bankruptcy. There were no options
granted during 2001. Outstanding options for 1,473,898 shares were cancelled
effective December31, 2001 in accordance with the Companys Plan of
reorganization. Successor Company The Successor Company had no options outstanding at December31, 2001. On May8, 2002, the shareholders approved a new Stock Option Plan. The Stock
Option Plan consists of two plans, one pertaining solely to the grant of
incentive stock options and one pertaining to the grant of other incentive
awards, including non-qualified stock options. The Stock Option Plan is
intended to obtain, retain services of, and provide incentive for, directors,
key employees and consultants. The Stock Option Plan allows for grants or
awards of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance awards, dividend
equivalents, deferred stock and stock payments. Under the Stock Option Plan, the aggregate number of shares which may be issued
upon exercise of options or other awards shall not exceed 650,000. Except for
non-employee directors, the exercise price and vesting period of each option is
to be set by the Companys Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors,
but the exercise price may not be less than the deemed fair value of the
Companys stock on the date of grant. Each option will expire on the date
specified in the option agreement, but not later than the tenth anniversary of
the date on which the option was granted. The Board of Directors, at its
option, may discontinue or amend the Stock Option Plan at any time, provided
that certain conditions are satisfied. Following is the per share weighted-average fair value of each option grant as
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions.

11. Workers Compensation As of December31, 2003, the Company utilized third-party insurance for losses
and liabilities associated with workers compensation claims subject to
deductible levels of $250,000 per occurrence for all claims incurred beginning
January1, 2000 through December31, 2003. The Company has increased the
deductible to $500,000 beginning January1, 2004. Claims incurred prior to
January1, 2000 were fully insured. Losses up to these deductible levels are
accrued based upon the Companys estimates of the aggregate liability for
claims incurred based on Company and industry experience. At December31, 2002
and 2003, other accrued expenses include reserves for workers compensation
claims of approximately $27million and $32million, respectively. In addition, the Company maintains cash deposits as required by the insurance
carrier. At December31, 2002 and 2003, such deposits were $47million and
$40million, respectively. These deposits will be utilized to pay future claim
settlements. 12. Professional Liability As of December31, 2003, the Company utilized third-party insurance for losses
and liabilities associated with professional liability claims subject to a
self-insured retention of $100,000 per occurrence for the year ended December
31, 2000 and a self-insured retention of $250,000 for all states except Florida
and Texas, which are subject to a self-insured retention of $500,000 per
occurrence, for the years ended December31, 2001 and 2002 and a self-insured
retention of $500,000 for all states for the year ended December31, 2003. The
retention level was increased to $750,000 for all states as of January1, 2004.
For the years through 2002, the third-party insurance provides the following
limits in excess of the self-insured retention: $1million per occurrence; $3
million aggregate per location; and $15million aggregate per policy year. For
2003 and 2004, the limit for aggregate loss per policy year was lowered to $10
million. If a lawsuit or claim arises which ultimately results in an uninsured
loss or a loss in excess of insured limits, such an outcome could have a
material adverse effect on the Company. Losses up to the retention levels are accrued based upon the Companys
estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred based on Company and
industry experience. At December31, 2002 and 2003, other accrued expenses
includes reserves for professional liability claims payable of approximately
$16million, and $21million respectively. 51 Table of Contents 13. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in ordinary, routine, or regulatory legal proceedings
incidental to its business. In the aggregate, such legal proceedings should not
have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of
operations, cash flow and liquidity. 14. Employee Benefit Plans The Company has a 401k Savings Plan the Savings Plan which is a defined
contribution plan covering employees of Assisted Living Concepts, Inc. who have
three months of service and are age 21 or older. Each year participants may
contribute up to 15% of pre-tax annual compensation and 100% of any Employer
paid cash bonus not to exceed statutory limits, as defined in the Savings
Plan. ALC may provide matching contributions as determined annually by ALCs
Board of Directors. Contributions are subject to certain limitations. The
Company has not made any contributions to this Savings Plan. 15. Liquidity The Company had working capital deficits of $2,854,000 and $11,729,000 at
December31, 2002 and December31, 2003, respectively. The Company has certain contingencies and reserves, including litigation
reserves, recorded as current liabilities at December31, 2003 that management
believes it will not be required to liquidate in cash during 2004. However, in
the event that all current liabilities become due within twelve months, the
Company may be required to obtain debt financing and/or sell securities on
unfavorable terms. There can be no assurance that such action may not be
necessary to ensure appropriate liquidity for the operations of the Company. 16. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company depends on the economies of Texas, Indiana, Oregon, Ohio and
Washington and to some extent, on the continued funding of State Medicaid
waiver programs in some of those states. As of December31, 2003, 226% of the
Companys properties were in Texas, 113% in Indiana, 102% in Oregon, 96% in
Ohio and 90% in Washington. Adverse changes in general economic factors
affecting the respective health care industries or laws and regulator
environment in each of these states, including Medicaid reimbursement rates,
could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and
results of operations. State Medicaid reimbursement programs constitute a significant source of
revenue for the Company. During the years ended December31, 2001, 2002, and
2003 direct payments received from state Medicaid agencies accounted for
approximately 121%, 128%, and 136% respectively, of the Companys revenue
while the resident paid portion received from Medicaid residents accounted for
approximately 72%, 79%, and 89% respectively, of the Companys revenue
during these periods. The Company expects in the future that State Medicaid
reimbursement programs will constitute a significant source of revenue for the
Company. Item1. Business
