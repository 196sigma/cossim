Item 8:Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data The
financial statements listed under the heading a1. Consolidated Financial
Statements of  herein, are included immediately following this page. 41 Report of Independent
Registered Chartered Accountants To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of MDSI Mobile Data Solutions Inc. We
have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of MDSI Mobile Data Solutions
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related Consolidated
Statements of Operations, Stockholders Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at c. These Consolidated Financial
Statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, such Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company and subsidiaries as at December 31, 2004
and 2003 and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic Consolidated Financial Statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly we express no such opinion. s/ Deloitte Touche LLP

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 
Expressed in United States dollars SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE
OF NON CASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES During
the year ended December 31, 2002 MDSI completed an agreement to sell its Hosting and IT
Services business segment, Connectria Corporation Connectria. Pursuant to the terms of
the agreement, the Company received from the former Connectria shareholders 824,700 shares
that had an approximate market value of $28 million and the cancellation of 103,088
previously issued stock options of MDSI as consideration for Connectria. In addition to
the share consideration, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MDSI received a warrant allowing it
to purchase up to 50,380 shares of Series A Nonvoting Preferred Stock of Connectria at a
price of $50 per share exercisable for a period of five years. The Series A Nonvoting
Preferred Stock of Connectria has a face value of $100 per share, bears a dividend of five
percent per annum, bears a liquidation preference equal to the face value, may be redeemed
at Connectrias option at any time, and must be redeemed by Connectria upon a capital
infusion of $10 million or greater. During
the year ended December 31, 2002 the Company entered into two capital lease arrangements
for the gross amount of $2,922,078 2001 $881,195 for newly purchased capital
assets. As a result of these arrangements the Company did not incur cash outlays to
purchase these assets but will pay lease obligations with interest accruing at interest
rates of up to 95% over terms of up to three years. Since these asset purchases in 2002
are non cash transactions, the gross amount of the leases have been excluded from both the
Acquisition of Capital Assets and Proceeds from Capital Leases line items. See accompanying
notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 47 MDSI MOBILE DATA

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 
Expressed in United States dollars 1. 
SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  These
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and reflect the following significant accounting policies:  
a 
Nature
of operations  
The
Company develops, markets and supports workforce management software solutions for use in
the mobile service industry. Prior to the disposition of Connectria Note 2, the Company
was also a provider of managed application services.  
b 
Basis
of presentation  
These
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries, and are presented in the Companys functional currency, the
United States dollars. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
MDSI is not involved with any variable interest entities, as defined by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. 46, having a significant effect on
the financial statements.  
In
June 2002, MDSI adopted a plan for sale and entered into an agreement to sell its Hosting
and IT services business segment Connectria Corporation Connectria to former Connectria
shareholders who were both shareholders and employees of the Company. As a result of this
transaction, the Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes have been
restated to present the results of the business as discontinued operations Note 2.  
c 
Foreign
exchange  
The
accounts of the Company and its foreign subsidiaries are expressed in United States
dollars, its functional currency. Current monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated at the rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Other
balance sheet items and revenues and expenses are translated at the rates prevailing on
the respective transaction dates. Translation gains and losses relating to monetary items
and revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are included in the Statements
of Operations.  
d 
Use
of estimates  
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting
for doubtful accounts, accrual for restructuring charges, amortization, determination of
net recoverable value of assets, revenue recognized on long-term contracts, taxes and
contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
e 
Cash
and cash equivalents  
Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, deposits in banks and highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less.  
f 
Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  
Accounts
receivable are comprised of billed and unbilled receivables arising from recognized or
deferred revenues. Receivables related to specific deferred revenues are offset for
balance sheet presentation. The Companys receivables are unsecured.  48 MDSI MOBILE DATA

ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued  
f 
Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts continued  
The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount it estimates to be
sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less
than full payment on its receivables. Individual overdue accounts are reviewed, and
allowance adjustments are recorded when determined necessary to state receivables at
realizable value.  
g 
Capital
assets  
Capital
assets are recorded at cost. Depreciation is charged to operations over the estimated
useful lives of the assets as follows:    
Computer hardware and software
Furniture and fixturesLeasehold improvementsVehicle 
30% declining balance20% declining balance
lesser of lease term or useful life, generally five years20% declining balance 
Reviews
are regularly performed to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate
that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is
shorter than originally estimated. The Company assesses the recoverability of its assets
held for use by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the
related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective
carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over
the fair value of those assets. If assets are determined to be recoverable, but the
useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book value of the assets is
depreciated over the newly determined remaining useful lives.  
h 
Revenue
recognition  
We
recognize revenue in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, as amended by SOP98-9, Modification of SOP97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions, SOP81-1,
Accounting for Performance of Construction-type and Certain Production-type
Contracts, the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,SAB No104,
Revenue Recognition, Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables and other authoritative accounting
literature. We derive revenues from the following sources: license fees, professional
services, maintenance and support fees and third party products and services.  
We
generally provide services with our supply agreements that include significant
production, modification, and customisation of the software. These services are not
separable and are essential to the functionality of the software, and as a result we
account for these licence and service arrangements under SOP 81-1 using the percentage of
completion method of contract accounting.  
License Fees and Professional Services  
Our
supply agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements. We
use the residual method to recognize revenue when a supply agreement includes one or more
elements to be delivered at a future date and Vendor Specific Objective Evidence of the
fair value of all undelivered elements exists. The fair value of the undelivered elements
is determined based on the historical evidence of stand-alone sales, or renewal terms of
these elements to customers. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee, which relates to
the license and implementation services, is recognized as revenue on a percentage of
completion basis. If evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does  49 MDSI MOBILE DATA

recognition continued  
not
exist, the total revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements
occurs or when fair value is established.  
We
estimate the percentage of completion on contracts with fixed fees on a monthly basis
utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the
project. If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion,
revenue is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer. When the total
cost estimate for a project exceeds revenue, we accrue for the estimated losses
immediately. The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the
assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related
expenses reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. A number of internal and
external factors can affect our estimates, including labor rates, utilization and
efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.  
We
are engaged on a continuous basis in the production and delivery of software under
contractual agreements. As a result we have developed a history of being able to estimate
costs to complete and the extent of progress toward completion of contracts, which
supports the use of the percentage of completion method of contract accounting.  
Professional
services revenue primarily consists of consulting and customer training revenues, which
are usually charged on a time and materials basis and are recognized as the services are
performed. Revenue from certain fixed price contracts is recognized on a proportional
performance basis, which involves the use of estimates related to total expected man-days
of completing the contract derived from historical experience with similar contracts. If
we do not have a sufficient basis to measure the progress towards completion, revenue is
recognized when the project is completed or when we receive final acceptance from the
customer.  
Maintenance
Revenue  
Generally,
maintenance is initially sold as an element of a master supply arrangement, with
subsequent annual renewals, and is priced as a percentage of new software license fees.
Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period, which
typically is one year. Maintenance and support revenue includes software license updates
that provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance
releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Product support
services also include Internet and telephone access to technical support personnel.  
Historically,
we have provided a warranty phase during the supply agreement. Services provided during
this warranty phase include elements of maintenance and support. As a result, we defer a
portion of the supply agreement fee, based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence of the
value of these services, and recognize the deferred amount as revenue over the warranty
period.  
Third
party products and services  
Revenue
from sales of third party products and services is recognized on delivery of the
products. Services are recognized on a percentage-complete basis. When software licenses
are sold incorporating third-party products or sold with third-party products, we
recognize as revenue the gross amount of sales of third-party product. The recognition of
gross revenue is in accordance with criteria established in Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue EITFNo99-19.  50 MDSI MOBILE DATA

On
occasion, we utilize third-party consultants to assist in implementations or
installations originated by the Company. In these cases, in accordance with criteria
established in EITF 99-19 as described above, the revenue for these implementations and
installations is typically recognized on a gross basis. In these cases, we ultimately
manage the engagement.  
Warranty  
The
Company warrants to its customers that its software will be in substantial conformance
with its specifications.

Research
and development  
Research
and development costs related to software are expensed as incurred unless a project meets
the specified criteria for capitalization in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 86 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Acquired research and development costs related to software
are charged to the Statements of Operations on acquisition if there is no alternative
future use and technological feasibility has not been established.  
j 
Income
taxes  
The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method,
deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial
reporting basis and tax basis of the Companys assets and liabilities. These deferred
taxes are measured by the provisions of currently enacted tax laws. A valuation allowance
is recognized to the extent the recoverability of future income tax assets is not
considered likely.  
k 
Earnings
loss per common share  
Basic
earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities by including
other common share equivalents in the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for a period, if dilutive. Common equivalent shares consist of incremental
shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method.  51 MDSI MOBILE DATA

For
the year ended December 31, 2004, 167,638 common share equivalents were included in the
calculation of diluted EPS due to the exercise price of these common share equivalents
being less than the market value at year end of the common shares. For the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, options to purchase 1,191,248 and 1,291,181 shares
respectively were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because of the net losses
in fiscal 2003 and 2002 and therefore their effect would be anti-dilutive.

Stock-based
compensation  
The

of the common share over the exercise price of the common stock option at the date

Comprehensive
income  
The
Company reports comprehensive income or loss in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards
for reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements.
Comprehensive income or loss, as defined, includes all changes in equity net assets
during a period from non-owner sources. The Company had no source of other comprehensive
income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002. Tax effects of other
comprehensive income or loss are not considered material for any period.  53 MDSI MOBILE DATA

o 
Accounting
for derivative instruments and hedging activities  
Effective
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, and the corresponding amendments under SFAS No. 138,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities an
amendment of SFAS No. 133 SFAS 138 and under SFAS No. 149, Amendment of SFAS No. 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 149. SFAS 133 requires that all
derivative financial instruments be recognized in the financial statements and measured
at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. If the derivative is
designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in net earnings loss. If the
derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the
fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income loss OCI
and are recognized in net earnings loss when the hedged item affects net earnings
loss. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are
recognized in net earnings loss. If the derivative used in an economic hedging
relationship is not designated in an accounting hedging relationship, changes in the fair
value of the derivative are recognized in net earnings loss.  
From
time to time the Company may attempt to hedge its position with respect to currency
fluctuations on specific contracts. This is generally accomplished by entering into
forward contracts. As at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 the Company had no
forward transactions open.

Recent
accounting pronouncements  
In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 123R Share-Based Payment SFAS
123R. This Statement is a revision of SFAS 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. SFAS123R establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in
which an entity receives employee services in exchange for an award of equity
instruments. This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for share-based
payment transactions with parties other than employees. This Statement is effective for
all awards granted, modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the beginning of the first
interim period after June 15, 2005. The Company intends to adopt this standard in the
period commencing July 1, 2005 on a prospective basis.  
In
June 2004, the FASB issued an exposure draft of a proposed Statement, Fair Value
Measurements to provide guidance on how to measure the fair value of financial and
non-financial assets and liabilities when required by other authoritative accounting
pronouncements. The proposed statement attempts to address concerns about the ability to
develop reliable estimates of fair value and inconsistencies in fair value guidance
provided by current US GAAP, by creating a framework that clarifies the fair value
objective and its application in GAAP. In addition, the proposal expands disclosures
required about the use of fair value to remeasure assets and liabilities. The standard
would be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the
Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  54 MDSI MOBILE DATA

In
March 2004, the FASB ratified consensuses reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
with respect to EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
and Its Application to Certain Investments. EITF Issue No. 03-1 addresses
recognition, measurement and disclosure of other-than-temporary impairment evaluations
for securities within the scope of SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities, and equity securities that are not subject to the scope
of SFAS No. 115 and are not accounted for under the equity method according to Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock. The recognition and measurement guidance is effective for reporting
periods beginning after June 15, 2004. Disclosures for cost method investments are
required to be included in annual financial statements prepared for fiscal years ending
after June 15, 2004. The Company does not have any significant cost method investments
and therefore adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on its Consolidated
Financial Statements.  
During
the year ended December 31, 2004, the FASB also issued the following Statements: SFAS No.
153 Exchanges of Non-Monetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29;
SFAS 152 Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions an amendment

Connectria
Corporation  
In
June 2002, MDSI adopted a plan for sale and entered into an agreement to sell its Hosting
and IT Services business segment, Connectria Corporation Connectria to former
Connectria shareholders who were both shareholders and employees of the Company. The
transaction closed in July 2002. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company
received from the former Connectria shareholders 824,700 shares that had an approximate
market value of $28 million and the cancellation of 103,088 previously issued stock
options of MDSI as consideration for Connectria. In addition to the share consideration,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of MDSI received a warrant allowing it to purchase up to 50,380
shares of Series A Nonvoting Preferred Stock of Connectria at a price of $50 per share
exercisable for a period of five years. The Series A Nonvoting Preferred Stock of
Connectria has a face value of $100 per share, bears a dividend of five percent per
annum, bears a liquidation preference equal to the face value, may be redeemed at
Connectrias option at any time, and must be redeemed by Connectria upon a capital
infusion of $10 million or greater. In addition MDSI has advanced to Connectria $500,000,
consisting of a loan in the principal amount of $250,000 with a two year term, bearing
interest at 5%, and $250,000 for prepaid hosting services. The loan was repaid subsequent
to December 31, 2003. The Company recognized a gain of $12,419 on the disposal of
Connectria. Connectria represented a significant segment of the Companys business.  
These
businesses are accounted for as discontinued operations and for reporting purposes the
results of operations, financial position and cash flow for the year ended December 31,
2002 are segregated from those of continuing operations for the period. The Company has
included in the results of the discontinued operations, the sale proceeds, the costs of
disposition, the results of operations from the measurement date to the disposal date and
an estimate of the costs to complete the remaining contracts.  55 MDSI MOBILE DATA

options  
The
Company adopted its Stock Option Plan to provide options to purchase common shares of the
Company for its employees, officers, directors and consultants. The options granted
pursuant to the Stock Option Plan are exercisable at a price which is equal to the fair
market value of the common shares at the time the options are granted. The options
typically vest over a three-year period and the term of the option is typically five
years. The maximum number of common shares reserved for issuance under the Stock Option
Plan, including current options outstanding, is 2,400,000 common shares. Upon acquisition
of Connectria the Company assumed certain obligations under the Connectria Stock Option
Plan, and all future option issuances will occur under the MDSI Plan. As a result of the
divestiture of Connectria note 2 all outstanding options under the Connectria plan were

purchase plan  
The
Company has established a voluntary stock compensation arrangement for its full and
part-time employees to purchase common shares of the Company by way of payroll deductions
for a maximum of CDN$10,000 for each employee per year. The subscription price of common
shares purchased under the 2002 Stock Purchase Plan is determined based upon a weighted
average market price of the Companys common shares each quarter, less 15%. During
the year ended December 31, 2004, 10,405 2003 37,375; 2002 85,405 common
shares were issued under the Stock Purchase Plan.  
c 
Shareholder
rights plan  
At
the Annual General Meeting on May 6, 1999, the Companys shareholders approved
the adoption of a Shareholder Rights Plan, similar to those adopted by other Canadian
companies. Under the terms of the Plan, rights were attached to the common shares of the
Company. These rights became marketable and exercisable only after certain specified
events related to the acquisition of, or announcement of an intention to acquire, 20% or
more of the outstanding common shares of the Company. The Plan had a 5-year term and
expired on May 6, 2004.  58 MDSI MOBILE DATA

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES Continued  
c 
Contingency
continued  
From
time to time, the Company is a party to litigation and claims incidental to the ordinary
course of its business. While the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted
with certainty, the Company believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have
a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, operating
results and cash flows.  
d 
Commitment  
During
the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company entered into a significant customer
contract in which the Company agreed to utilize a certain amount of local services and
create a certain amount of commercial activity in South Africa. The Company is required
to utilize local content or obtain credits equivalent to approximately $71 million over
a seven-year period ending May 2010. The Company has furnished a performance guarantee
equal to approximately 5% of such amounts. The Company expects to fulfill its obligation
through a number of activities, including the establishment of a software development
center in South Africa, the provision of technical services, and the provision of
training to local systems integrators who will be able to provide implementation services
with respect to the Companys software products. As the Company expects to fulfill
its obligations through the purchase of services in the normal course of business, no
liability has been established for these future-spending commitments. As at December 31,
2004 the Company has generated an estimated $989,328 2003 $175,000 of credits
relating to this obligation. The Companys obligation is expected to increase as a
result of contract expansions. In the event that the Company determines that it will be
unable to meet this commitment in the normal course of operations it will record a
liability in the period such circumstances are determinable.  
e 
Indemnification  
The
Company typically includes indemnification provisions within license and implementation
service agreements, which are consistent with those prevalent in the software industry.
Such provisions indemnify customers against actions arising from patent infringements
that may arise through the normal use or proper possession of the Companys
software. To date the Company has not experienced any significant obligations under
customer indemnification provisions and accordingly, no amounts have been accrued for
such potential indemnification obligations.  10.

FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS  
The
carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, certain other assets,
accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and capital lease obligations approximate their
respective fair values as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.  
The
Companys revenues have historically been dependent on large contracts from a
limited number of customers in the utility, telecommunications and cable sectors. Where
exposed to credit risk, the Company mitigates this risk by analyzing the counter-partiesfinancial
condition prior to entering into agreements, establishing billing arrangements and
assessing the collectibility of the account on an ongoing basis. As these customers are
geographically dispersed, concentrations of credit risk are further mitigated.  63 MDSI MOBILE DATA

Stock-based
compensation  
Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the new amended provisions of the CICA Handbook
Section 3870 Stock based Compensation and Other Stock-based Payments which
required entities to account for employee stock options using the fair value based method
under Canadian GAAP. In accordance with the transitional options permitted under amended
Section 3870, the Company prospectively applied the fair value based method to all
employee stock options granted on or after January 1, 2003, using the fair value based
method.  
The
fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of the grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

a result of the differing methods of recognizing stock based compensation under Canadian
GAAP and US GAAP, a charge of $252,506 2003 $227,401; 2002 $nil would
have been or has been recognized in the Canadian GAAP statement of operations and the
same amount was recorded as other stockholders equity, while no corresponding
amount for stock based compensation has been recognized in the US GAAP consolidated
financial statements.  
The

fair value based method had been applied to all options awarded on or after January 1,

Comprehensive
income  
For
US GAAP purposes, the Company reports comprehensive income or loss in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Under Canadian GAAP, companies do
not report comprehensive income or loss.  
For
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 there were no comprehensive income or
loss for the under US GAAP.  c 
Future
income taxes  
Under
US GAAP tax rates applied in the calculation of future income taxes are those rates that
are passed into law. Under Canadian GAAP substantially enacted rates are used. The
Company determined that there is no material effect on the consolidated financial
statements.  d 
StockholdersEquity  
While
there is no net difference between stockholders equity as reported under US GAAP
and under Canadian GAAP, the various components within stockholders equity are
affected by the acquisition in 2000 and disposition in 2002 of Connectria, which was
accounted for using the pooling method under US GAAP and using the purchase method under
Canadian GAAP and by the change in reporting and functional currency from Canadian
dollars to US dollars during the year ended December 31, 2000.  70 Selected Quarterly
Financial Data unaudited The following
table sets forth certain unaudited statement of operations data for each of the eight
quarters beginning January 1, 2003 and ending December 31, 2004 as well as the percentage
of the Companys revenue represented by each item. The unaudited financial statements
have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements contained herein
and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that the
Company considers necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction
with the Companys audited financial statements and the notes thereto appearing
elsewhere in this report. In view of the Companys recent restructuring and other
factors, the Company believes that quarterly comparisons of its financial results are not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future
performance.

Item 5:Controls and
Procedures Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting As
disclosed in the Companys quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March
31, 2004, the Company has undertaken certain steps to strengthen the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. These steps have included implementing a formal
contract review checklist for each new contract, a thorough review and analysis of new
software and implementation contracts by senior members of the Companys accounting
group, a determination of the appropriate revenue recognition treatment for each new
contract by senior members of the accounting group, revisions to the Companys
standard contractual wording, improving communication between the various functional
groups within the Company namely sales, implementation, accounting and legal at both the
contract negotiation and execution level and at the implementation level, requiring any
exceptions to the Companys standard contractual wording to be approved at a senior
management level and review by management of any unusual terms which may impact the
Companys historical practice of accounting for revenue. The Companys
management is in the process of a further review and assessment of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting in light of the requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules adopted by the SEC thereunder, which the SEC
currently plans to implement for non-accelerated and foreign filers for fiscal years
ending on or after July 15, 2006. As of the date of this report, the Company is not an
accelerated filer and, accordingly, the Company expects these additional requirements to
apply to the Company for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The Companys
management may recommend and the Company may implement additional changes in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting pursuant to this review. In light
of these additional SEC requirements and the Companys current level of activities,
the Company is evaluating the level of staffing of its finance group. Except
as described in the foregoing paragraphs, no changes were made in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures In
connection with the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, the Companys
management, with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Exchange Act as of the end of the
period covered by this report the Evaluation Date. Based
upon the evaluation described above, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, the Companys disclosure controls
and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to the material information relating
to the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries required to be included in reports that
the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act. Note Regarding Control
Limitations The
Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, does not expect that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures or
internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have
been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some
persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected. 73 Item 1: Business
