ITEM8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The financial statements and related information contained in this Annual Report have been
prepared by and are the responsibility of the Companys management. The Companys financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect judgments and
estimates as to the expected effects of transactions and events currently being reported. The Companys management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and other financial information included in this
Annual Report. To meet this responsibility, the Company maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The system
includes policies and procedures, internal audits, and Company officers reviews.  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of directors who are independent under applicable SEC and New York Stock Exchange rules. The Audit Committee meets periodically and, when appropriate, separately with
representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, Company officers, and the internal auditors to monitor the activities of each.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, was appointed by the Audit Committee to audit the Companys financial statements and
managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and their report follows. The stockholders ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the COSO. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included below.  /s/ William H. Swanson s/ Biggs C. Porter

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Raytheon Company:  We have completed integrated audits of Raytheon Companys 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits,
are presented below.  Consolidated Financial Statements In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  As discussed in Note N to the consolidated financial statements, in 2004 the Company changed its measurement date for its Pension Benefits
and Other Benefits plans from October31 to December31.  Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item8, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 1, 2006

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note A: Accounting Policies Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Raytheon Company the Company and all wholly-owned and
majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries except for RC Trust I, as described in Note I, Equity Security Units. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with
the current year presentation.  Revenue RecognitionSales under
long-term contracts generally are recorded under the percentage of completion method. Incurred costs and estimated gross margins are recorded as sales when work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to the Companys
estimates of total costs and contract value. Cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor, materials, warranty, and overhead. Some contracts contain incentive provisions based upon performance in relation to established targets,
which are included at estimated realizable value. Contract change orders and claims are included when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. Since many contracts extend over a long period of time, revisions in cost
and contract value estimates during the progress of work have the effect of adjusting earnings applicable to performance in prior periods in the current period. When the current contract estimate indicates a loss, provision is made for the total
anticipated loss in the current period. Contracts with multiple elements, primarily license fees, are evaluated and separated, as appropriate, into elements on which revenue is recognized in the proper periods.  Revenue from aircraft sales are recognized at the time of physical delivery of the completed
aircraft. Revenue from certain qualifying non-cancelable aircraft lease contracts are accounted for as sales-type leases. The present value of all payments, net of executory costs, are recorded as revenue, and the related costs of the aircraft are
charged to cost of sales. Associated interest, using the interest method, is recorded over the term of the lease agreements. All other leases for aircraft are accounted for under the operating method wherein revenue is recorded as earned over the
rental period. Service revenue is recognized ratably over contractual periods or as services are performed. Revenue from the sale of fractional shares is recognized over the expected life of the customer relationship.  Revenue from license fees are recognized over the expected
life of the continued involvement with the customer.  Lot
AccountingThe Company uses lot accounting for new commercial aircraft introductions at Raytheon Aircraft Company Raytheon Aircraft or RAC. Lot accounting involves selecting an initial lot size at the time a new aircraft begins to be
delivered and measuring an average margin over the entire lot for each aircraft sold. The costs attributed to aircraft delivered are based on the estimated average margin of all aircraft in the lot and are determined under the learning curve
concept, which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs from cost reduction initiatives and as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition. Costs incurred on in-process and delivered aircraft in excess of the
estimated average margin were included in inventories and totaled $67 million and $89 million on Premier at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and $112 million and $90 million on Hawker 4000 at December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Once the initial lot has been completed, the use of lot accounting is discontinued. The Company determines lot size based on several factors, including the size of firm backlog, the expected annual production on the aircraft, and
experience on similar new aircraft. The size of the initial lot for the Beechcraft Premier I is 200 units of which 143 had been delivered at December31, 2005. There was 26 units for the Premier in firm backlog of which 11 units are expected to
be delivered from the initial lot. The size of the initial lot for the Hawker 4000 is 75 units, no units had been delivered at December31, 2005. There was 74 units for the Hawker 4000 in firm backlog of which 34 units are expected to be
delivered from the initial lot. At December31, 2005, deferred costs of $56 million related to Premier and $89 million related to Hawker 4000 were not recoverable from existing firm orders.  Product WarrantyCosts incurred under warranty provisions performed under
long-term contracts are accounted for as contract costs as the work is performed. The estimation of these costs is an integral part of the determination of the pricing of the Companys products and services.  Warranty provisions related to commercial aircraft sales are determined based upon an
estimate of costs that may be incurred for warranty services and other post-sales support programs.

Research and Development
ExpensesExpenditures for Company-sponsored research and development projects and bid and proposal costs are expensed as incurred. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts are accounted for as contract
costs as the work is performed.  Federal and Foreign Income
TaxesThe Company and its domestic subsidiaries provide for federal income taxes on pretax accounting income at rates in effect under existing tax law. Foreign subsidiaries have recorded provisions for income taxes at applicable foreign tax
rates in a similar manner.  Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash
equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.  Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will
not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer credit-worthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables, and collateral to the extent applicable.  Activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:  In millions Balance at December31, 2002 73 Provisions 1 Utilizations 39 Balance at December31, 2003 35 Provisions 1 Utilizations 1 Balance at December31, 2004 35 Provisions 4 Utilizations 15 Balance at December31, 2005 24
Contracts in
ProcessContracts in process are stated at cost plus estimated profit, but not in excess of realizable value.  
58 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Deferred Contract CostsCertain costs incurred in the performance of the Companys government
contracts are required to be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs include a portion of the Companys workers compensation, environmental expenses, and asset
retirement obligations. These costs become allocable to contracts when they are paid, at which time they are charged to contracts and recovered from the government. The Company regularly assesses the probability of recovery of these costs. This
assessment requires the Company to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under the Companys contracts and the amount of future contract activity. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of
these costs, the profitability of the Companys remaining contracts could be adversely affected.  InventoriesInventories are stated at cost first-in, first-out or average cost, but not in excess of realizable value. A provision for excess or inactive inventory is recorded based upon an analysis that
considers current inventory levels, historical usage patterns, future sales expectations, and salvage value.  Property, Plant, and EquipmentProperty, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor improvements are charged to
expense. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. Gains and losses resulting from the
sale of plant and equipment at the government and defense businesses are included in overhead and reflected in the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government.  Provisions for depreciation are generally computed using a combination of accelerated and straight-line methods. Depreciation provisions are
based on estimated useful lives as follows: buildings20 to 45 years, machinery and equipment3 to 10 years, and equipment leased to others5 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of
the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement.  Impairment of
Goodwill and Long-lived AssetsIn accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No142, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other
intangible assets, the Company performs periodic tests of goodwill impairment. A two-step impairment test is used to first identify potential goodwill impairment and then measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any. The Company performs
the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. In 2005, the Company recorded a $22 million pretax, $19 million after-tax goodwill impairment charge in administrative and selling expenses related to Flight Options FO which is
included in the Other segment. The impairment was a result of changes in valuation assumptions, the effect of projecting recent performance variances on future periods and the addition of $28 million in goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the
minority shares. If losses at FO were to continue over the longer-term or if FOs financial objectives were no longer expected to be achieved, the Companys investment in FO could become further impaired and additional charges may be
required. FO must demonstrate substantial operating results improvement to achieve its financial objectives including achieving its sales forecasts, reducing maintenance expense, and improving dispatch availability over the 2005 average. The fair
value of FO was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology since there were no market comparables available. There was no goodwill impairment associated with the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter 2005 other than at FO.
There was no goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003.  The
amount of goodwill by segment at December31, 2005 was $749 million for Integrated Defense Systems, $1,387 million for Intelligence and Information Systems, $3,438 million for Missile Systems, $2,306 million for Network Centric Systems, $2,674
million for Space and Airborne Systems, $867 million for Technical Services, and $133 million for Other. The amount of goodwill by segment at December31, 2004 was $755 million for Integrated Defense Systems, $1,349 million for Intelligence and
Information Systems, $3,438 million for Missile Systems, $2,306 million for Network Centric Systems, $2,674 million for Space and Airborne Systems, $867 million for Technical Services, and $127 million for Other. Information about additions to
goodwill is included in Note C, Acquisitions and Divestitures. 
59 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Intangible assets subject to amortization consisted primarily of drawings and intellectual property totaling $63
million net of $62 million of accumulated amortization at December31, 2005 and $74 million net of $52 million of accumulated amortization at December31, 2004. Amortization expense is expected to approximate $13 million for each of
the next five years.  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company determines whether long-lived assets are to be held-for-use or held-for-disposal. Upon indication of possible impairment, the Company evaluates the
recoverability of held-for-use long-lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to
recover the carrying value of the asset, the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held-for-disposal, the Company must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed
held-for-disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.  Computer SoftwareInternal use computer software, which consists primarily of an integrated financial package, is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated
useful life, generally 10 years.  InvestmentsInvestments, which
are included in other assets, include equity ownership of 20% to 50% in unconsolidated affiliates and of less than 20% in other companies. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the equity method. Investments in other
companies with readily determinable market prices are stated at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income. Other investments are stated at cost.  Advance Payments and Billings in Excess of Costs IncurredThe Company receives
advances, performance-based payments, and progress payments from customers which may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts.  Comprehensive IncomeComprehensive income and its components are presented in the statement of stockholders equity.  Accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of the following at December31:
In millions
2005 2004 Minimum pension liability 1,978 2,025 Unrealized gains losses on interest-only strips 3 1 Interest rate lock 1 1 Foreign exchange translation 23 70 Cash flow hedges 4 39 Unrealized gains on investments 1 1 Total 1,950 1,919
The minimum pension liability
adjustment is shown net of tax benefits of $1,065 million and $1,089 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The unrealized gains losses on interest-only strips are shown net of tax liability of $2 million at December31,
2005 and net of tax benefits of $1 million at December31, 2004. The interest rate lock is shown net of tax benefits of $1 million at December31, 2005 and 2004. The cash flow hedges are shown net of tax liabilities of $2 million and $21
million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Translation of
Foreign CurrenciesAssets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates and the effects of these translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders equity. Deferred taxes are not recognized for translation-related temporary 
60 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
differences of foreign subsidiaries as their undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently invested. Income and expenses in foreign currencies are
translated at the weighted-average exchange rate during the period. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses in 2005, 2004, and 2003 were not material.  Pension CostsThe Company has several pension and retirement plans covering the majority of employees, including certain employees in foreign countries.
Annual charges to income are made for the cost of the plans, including current service costs, interest on projected benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. Unfunded accumulated benefit
obligations are included in accrued retiree benefits and other long-term liabilities. The Company funds annually those pension costs which are calculated in accordance with Internal Revenue Service regulations and standards issued by the Cost
Accounting Standards Board.  Interest Rate and Foreign Currency
ContractsThe Company meets its working capital requirements with a combination of variable rate short-term and fixed rate long-term financing. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or interest rate locks with commercial and
investment banks to manage interest rates associated with the Companys financing arrangements. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks to fix the dollar value of specific commitments and payments
to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts. The hedges used by the Company are transaction driven and are directly related to a particular asset, liability, or transaction for which a commitment is in place.
These instruments are executed with credit-worthy institutions and the majority of the foreign currencies are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.  Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash, cash equivalents, and short-term debt approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities and varying interest rates. The estimated fair value of notes receivable
approximates the carrying value based principally on the underlying interest rates and terms, maturities, collateral, and credit status of the receivables. The estimated fair value of investments, other than those accounted for under the cost or
equity method, are based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of long-term debt of approximately $47 billion at December31, 2005 was based on quoted market prices.  Estimated fair values for financial instruments are based on pricing models using current market information. The amounts realized upon
settlement of these financial instruments will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.  Minority InterestThe Companys minority interest primarily relates to its investment in Thales-Raytheon Systems Co. Ltd., described in Note G, Other
Assets.  Employee Stock PlansIn 2004, the Company changed the primary form of
its broad-based equity compensation from stock options to restricted stock. The fair value at the date of award of restricted stock is credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital. The fair value is
charged to income as compensation expense over the vesting period.  In
2004, the Company established the Long-Term Performance Plan LTPP which provides for restricted stock unit awards granted from the 2001 Stock Plan to the Companys senior leadership. These awards vest when specific pre-established levels of
Company performance are achieved over a three-year performance cycle. The Company recognizes compensation expense for variable award plans over the performance period based upon the then-current market values of the underlying stock as well as the
expected achievement of performance levels.  The Company applies Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, because stock options were issued at exercise prices equal to fair value,
no compensation expense has been recognized for the Companys stock option plans, however, stock-based compensation expense has been recorded for restricted stock and the LTPP. Proceeds 
61 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
from the exercise of stock options under employee stock plans are credited to common stock at par value and the excess is credited to additional paid-in
capital. Income tax benefits arising from employees premature disposition of stock option shares and exercise of nonqualified stock options are credited to additional paid-in capital.  Had compensation expense for the Companys stock-based compensation been determined
based on the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans, consistent with the methodology prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Companys net income
and earnings per share would have approximated the pro forma amounts indicated below:  In millions except per share amounts

The weighted-average fair value of

revised 2004, Share-Based Payments SFAS No123R. SFAS No123R requires the recognition of compensation expense related to stock options under SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. In April 2005, the effective
date for this accounting standard was deferred until the first annual period beginning after June15, 2005. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No123R prospectively in the first quarter of 2006 with an anticipated impact to earnings per
share of less than $002 per share for the year 2006.  In November 2004, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No151, an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4, Inventory Costs SFAS No151. This accounting standard, which is effective for annual periods beginning after June15,
2005, requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current-period charges. The adoption of SFAS No151 is not expected to have a material effect on
the Companys financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  Risks and UncertaintiesThe Company is engaged in supplying defense-related equipment to the U.S. and foreign governments, and is subject to certain business risks specific to that industry. Sales to the government may be
affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing concepts of national defense, political developments abroad, and other factors. 
62 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
The highly competitive market for business and special mission aircraft is also subject to certain business risks.
These risks include timely development and certification of new product offerings, the current state of the general aviation and commuter aircraft markets, and government regulations affecting aircraft.  The Companys consolidated financial statements are based on the application of
generally accepted accounting principles which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects can not
be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to the Companys financial statements.
NoteB: Discontinued Operations In 2000, the Company sold its Raytheon Engineers Constructors businesses REC to Washington Group International, Inc. WGI. As a result of WGIs
bankruptcy, the Company was required to perform various contract and lease obligations under letters of credit, surety bonds, and guarantees Support Agreements that it had provided to project owners and other parties.  The Company has settled many of its Support Agreement obligations. For its remaining Support
Agreement obligations, the Company has various risks and exposures, including warranty close out, various liquidated damages issues, and potential adverse claims resolution.  The Company is currently engaged in a dispute with AES Red Oak LLC AES over the close out of the Red Oak power project. The dispute
involves, among other things, a draw down of $30 million by AES in August 2004 from a line of credit provided by the Company.  In 2005, 2004, and 2003, the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to REC was $41 million, $42 million, and $231 million, respectively. In 2005 and 2004,
the Company recorded after-tax charges of $23 million and $24 million, respectively, for an estimated liability for foreign tax-related matters. Although not expected to be material, additional losses on foreign tax-related matters could be recorded
in the future as estimates are revised or the underlying matters are settled. Included in 2003 were charges of $176 million related to the completion of the Mystic Station and Fore River construction projects in Massachusetts.  The after-tax loss from discontinued operations related to REC was $50 million, $48
million, and $151 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.  Liabilities
from discontinued operations included net current liabilities for REC of $33 million and $17 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  In 2002, the Company sold its Aircraft Integration Systems business AIS for $1,123 million, net, subject to purchase price adjustments. As part of the transaction, the
Company retained the responsibility for performance of the Boeing Business Jet BBJ program and retained certain assets related to the BBJ program, which is now essentially complete. In January 2006, a dispute regarding the AIS purchase price was
resolved in arbitration and the Company recorded a pretax charge of $26 million in 2005 related to this settlement.  In 2005, 2004, and 2003, the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to AIS was $33 million, $23 million and $30 million, respectively, primarily related to the
completion of the BBJ program and the resolution of the purchase price dispute.  Assets and liabilities related to AIS included net current assets of $19 million as of December31, 2004 and net current liabilities of $16 million and $7 million as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  In 2005, the total loss from discontinued operations was $74 million pretax, $71 million
after-tax, or $016 per basic and diluted share versus $65 million pretax, $63 million after-tax, or $014 per basic and diluted share in 2004 and $261 million pretax, $170 million after-tax, or $041 per basic and diluted share in 2003.

The U.S. government has title to the
assets related to unbilled amounts on contracts that provide for progress payments. Unbilled amounts are recorded under the percentage of completion method and are recoverable from the customer upon shipment of the product, presentation of billings,
or completion of the contract.  Included in contracts in process at
December31, 2005 and 2004 was $27 million and $66 million, respectively, related to claims on contracts, which were recorded at their estimated realizable value. The Company believes that it has a legal basis for pursuing recovery of these
claims and that collection is probable. The settlement of these amounts depends on individual circumstances and negotiations with the counterparty, therefore, the timing of the collection will vary and approximately $11 million of collections are
expected to extend beyond one year.  Billed and unbilled contracts in process
include retentions arising from contractual provisions. At December31, 2005, retentions amounted to $36 million and are anticipated to be collected as follows: $26 million in 2006 and the balance thereafter.  Note E: Inventories Inventories consisted of the following at December31:  In millions

The Company provides long-term
financing to its aircraft customers. The underlying aircraft serve as collateral for general aviation and commuter aircraft receivables. The Company maintains reserves for estimated uncollectible aircraft-related long-term receivables. The balance
of these reserves was $13 million and $28 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The reserves for estimated uncollectible aircraft-related long-term receivables represent the Companys current estimate of future losses. The
Company established these reserves based on an overall evaluation of identified 
66 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
risks. As a part of that evaluation, the Company evaluated certain specific receivables and considered factors including extended delinquency and requests
for restructuring, among other things. Long-term receivables included commuter aircraft receivables of $228 million and $281 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  The Company accrues interest on aircraft-related long-term receivables in accordance with the terms of the underlying notes. When an
aircraft-related long-term receivable is over 90 days past due, the Company generally stops accruing interest. At December31, 2005 and 2004, there were $7 million and $27 million, respectively, of aircraft-related long-term receivables on
which the Company was not accruing interest. Interest payments related to these receivables are credited to income when received. Once a past-due receivable has been brought current, the Company begins to accrue interest again. Interest deemed to be
uncollectible is written off at the time the determination is made.  In 2004,
the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain general aviation finance receivables, with the buyer assuming all servicing responsibilities. As part of the agreement, the Company retained a first loss deficiency guarantee of 75% of the
receivable amount sold. In 2005 and 2004, $5 million and $37 million, respectively, of receivables were sold under the agreement, with no associated gain or loss. Also in 2005 and 2004, the Company sold $18 million and $22 million, respectively, of
general aviation finance receivables without any continuing involvement.  In
2003, the Company sold an undivided interest in $337 million of general aviation finance receivables, while retaining a subordinated interest in and servicing rights to the receivables. The Company received proceeds of $279 million and recognized a
gain of $2 million. In connection with the sale, the Company formed a qualifying special purpose entity QSPE for the sole purpose of buying these receivables. The Company irrevocably, and without recourse, transferred the receivables to the QSPE
which in turn, issued beneficial interests in these receivables to a commercial paper conduit. The transaction involves a third party guarantee of the conduit investment. The assets of the QSPE are not available to pay the claims of the Company or
any other entity. The Company retained a subordinated interest in the receivables sold of approximately 17%. The conduit obtained the funds to purchase the interest in the receivables, other than the retained interest, by selling commercial paper to
third-party investors. The Company retained responsibility for the collection and administration of receivables. The Company continues to service the sold receivables and charges the third party conduit a monthly servicing fee at market rates.
The Company accounted for the sale under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. The gain was determined at the date of transfer based upon the relative fair value of the assets sold and the interests retained.
The Company estimated the fair value at the date of transfer and at December31, 2005 and 2004 based on the present value of future expected cash flows using certain key assumptions, including collection period and a discount rate of 50 62%, and 56%, respectively. At December31, 2005 a 10 and 20% adverse change in the collection period and discount rate would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  At December31, 2005 and 2004, the outstanding balance of securitized accounts
receivable held by the third party conduit totaled $157 million and $204 million, respectively, of which the Companys subordinated retained interest was $59 million and $58 million, respectively, and the fair value of the servicing asset was
$2 million and $4 million, respectively.  Computer software amortization
expense was $77 million, $64 million, and $52 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accumulated amortization of computer software was $327 million and $261 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In 2001, the Company formed a joint
venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems TRS that has two major operating subsidiaries, one of which the Company controls and consolidates. TRS is a system of systems integrator and provides fully customized solutions through the integration of command
and control centers, radars, and communication networks. HRL Laboratories is a scientific research facility whose staff engages in the areas of space and defense technologies. TelASIC Communications delivers high performance, cost-effective radio
frequency RF, analog mixed signal, and digital solutions for both the commercial and defense electronics markets.  In 2005, the Company sold its interest in Indra ATM S.L., a Spanish joint venture, for $59 million, and recorded a gain of $45 million.  In 1995, through the acquisition of E-Systems, Inc., the Company invested in Space Imaging
and had a 31% equity investment in Space Imaging LLC. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company paid $130 million related to a Space Imaging credit facility that matured in March 2003 for which the Company had guaranteed and accrued for in a prior
year. In exchange for this payment, the Company received a note from Space Imaging for this amount that the Company has valued at zero. In January 2006, substantially all of the assets of Space Imaging were sold. The Company received total proceeds
of approximately $25 million which will be recorded as other income.  In
addition, the Company has entered into joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of the customer, generally the U.S. government, whereby the Company receives a subcontract from the
joint venture in the joint ventures capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, the Company records the work it performs for the joint venture as operating activity. Joint ventures are not subject to the Companys internal control
structure.  Certain joint ventures and equity and cost method investments are
not listed separately in the table above as the Companys investment in these entities is less than $5 million. Information for these joint ventures and investments has not been separately disclosed since they are not material either

The notes and debentures redeemable at
any time are at redemption prices equal to the present value of remaining principal and interest payments. Information about the subordinated notes payable is included in Note I, Equity Security Units.  The debentures due in 2025 were redeemable at the option of the Company on or after
July15, 2005 at a redemption price of 103% of par. In 2005, the Company exercised its call rights to repurchase all of these debentures, with a par value of $196 million, at a loss of $10 million pretax.  In 2004, the Company repurchased long-term debt with a par value of $1,773 million at a loss
of $100 million pretax which was included in other expense.  In 2003, the
Company issued $425 million of long-term debt and used the proceeds to reduce the amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit. Also in 2003, the Company issued $500 million of fixed rate long-term debt and $200 million of floating
rate notes. The proceeds were used to partially fund the repurchase of long-term debt with a par value of $924 million at a loss of $77 million pretax, which was included in other expense.  The Company enters into various interest rate swaps that correspond to a portion of the
Companys fixed rate debt in order to effectively hedge interest rate risk. The $600 million notional value of the interest rate swaps that remained outstanding at December31, 2005 effectively converted that portion of the Companys
total fixed rate debt to variable rate debt based on LIBOR.

The principal amounts of long-term debt were reduced by debt issue discounts of $58 million and $81 million at

In March 2005, the Company entered
into a $22 billion bank revolving credit facility which replaced its previous $23 billion revolving credit facilities. Under the current credit facility, the Company can draw down on lines of credit and use the credit facility to support
commercial paper or letters of credit that the Company may issue for short-term liquidity. The credit facility matures in March 2010. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest based on LIBOR. As of December31, 2005 and
December31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the current credit facility and the previous credit facilities, respectively; however, the Company had approximately $100 million of outstanding letters of credit at December31, 2005 and
2004, which effectively reduced the Companys borrowing capacity under the current credit facility and the previous credit facilities by such amount at such dates.  Under its current credit facility, the Company must comply with certain covenants, including the ratio of total debt to total capitalization
of no more than 50% and the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, of no less than 30 to 10. The
Company was in compliance with the covenants during the period in 2005 in which such credit facility was in place and expects to continue to be in compliance throughout 2006.  Certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company maintain revolving bank lines of credit to provide them with a limited amount of short term
liquidity. In 2005, Raytheon United Kingdom Limited, a U.K. subsidiary, entered into a $150 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility which replaced its previous uncommitted bank lines totaling $84 million. There was $53 million of
outstanding borrowings under the facility at December31, 2005. There were no outstanding borrowings under the bank lines at December31, 2004. In addition, other uncommitted bank lines totaled $6 million and $7 million at
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Compensating balance arrangements are not material.  Total cash paid for interest on notes payable and long-term debt was $310 million, $396
million, and $515 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Note I: Equity Security Units In 2001, the Company issued 17,250,000, 825%, $50 par value equity security units. Each equity security unit consisted of a contract to purchase shares of the Companys common stock on May15, 2004 and a mandatorily redeemable
equity security with a stated liquidation amount of $50 due on May15, 2006.  In 2004, in accordance with the terms of the equity security units, the Company issued 270million shares of common stock and received proceeds of $863 million. The contract required a quarterly distribution, which was recorded as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital, of 125%per year of the stated amount of $50 per purchase contract. Cash paid for the quarterly distribution on the contract was $4 million in 2004 and $11 million in 2003. The mandatorily redeemable
equity security represents preferred stock of RC Trust I RCTI, a subsidiary of the Company that initially issued this preferred stock to the Company in exchange for a subordinated note. The subordinated notes $408 million at December31,
2005 and 2004, which are due on May15, 2006, have the same terms as the mandatorily redeemable equity security and represent an undivided interest in the assets of RCTI, a Delaware business trust formed for the purpose of issuing these
securities and whose assets consist solely of subordinated notes issued by the Company. The subordinated notes pay a quarterly distribution, which was included in interest expense, of 70%per year. Cash paid for the quarterly distribution on
the subordinated notes was $27 million in 2005, $47 million in 2004 and $60 million in 2003. In 2004, subordinated notes with a par value of $481 million were repurchased at a loss of $32 million pretax, which was included in other expense.
RCTI is considered to be a variable interest entity and because the preferred
stock was a part of the equity security units issued by the Company, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of RCTI. As a result, RCTI is not consolidated by the Company. The Company has a $27 million investment in RCTI which
represents all of the common stock of RCTI and is included in other noncurrent assets. The Company owes $27 million to RCTI included in subordinated notes payable in connection with this investment.

On November30, 2004, the Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase, between January1, 2005 and December31, 2006, of up to $700 million of the Companys common stock. In 2005, the Company repurchased 112million shares of common stock for $436 million
under this program.  The Company issued 2,325,000 and 6,486,000 shares of
common stock in 2004 and 2003, respectively, to fund the Company Match and Company Contributions, as described in Note N, Pension and Other Employee Benefits. In addition, employee-directed 401k plan purchases Employee Contributions of the
Company stock fund were funded through the issuance of 134,000 and 2,491,000 shares of common stock in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the
earnings of the entity.  The weighted-average shares outstanding for basic and
diluted EPS were as follows:  In thousands

than the average market price of the Companys common stock during the respective years.  Stock options to purchase 172million, 195million, and 153million shares of common stock outstanding at December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, had exercise prices that were less than
the average market price of the Companys common stock during the respective periods and are included in the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock, LTPP and equity security units in the table above.  The Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of preferred stock 001 par value per share, in multiple series with terms as determined by the Board of Directors.  As discussed in Commitments and Contingencies, the terms of the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit include the issuance of warrants for the Companys stock with a stipulated value of $200 million.
The warrants will have a five-year term with a strike price of $3750 and will be issued when the settlement proceeds are distributed to the claimants which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2006.  Note K: Federal and Foreign Income Taxes The provision for federal and foreign income taxes consisted of the following:  In millions

Current income tax expense Federal 451 138 130
Foreign 19 7 3
Deferred income tax benefit expense Federal 21 5 94
Foreign 7 Total 498 140 227
The provision benefit for state
income taxes of $8 million, $6 million, and $1 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, was included in administrative and selling expenses as these costs can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S.
government in the period for which the tax is payable. Accordingly, the deferred state income tax provision benefit, which is not material, will be allocated to contracts in future periods as they are realized. 
72 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
The provision for income taxes differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to the following:  2005 2004 2003 Statutory tax rate

346 242 298  In 2005, 2004, and 2003, domestic
income before taxes was $1,364 million, $559 million, and $754 million, respectively, and foreign income before taxes was $76 million, $20 million, and $8 million, respectively. Income reported for federal and foreign tax purposes differs from
pretax accounting income due to differences between U.S. Internal Revenue Code or foreign tax law requirements and the Companys accounting practices. No provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries as these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. Total net cash payments were approximately $56 million, $5
million, and $13 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.  The Company is
currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS for the years 1998 through 2002. IRS examinations have been completed for tax years through 1997. The Company has protested certain positions taken by the IRS examination team on
certain items related to the years 1995 through 1997 and those items are now being considered by the Appeals Division Appeals of the IRS.  In addition, the Companys federal research tax credit refund claim for the years 1984 through 1990 remains under examination, and certain items regarding the
Companys Foreign Sales Corporation FSC benefit for the years 1989 through 1997 are also at Appeals. The Company believes adequate provisions for all outstanding issues have been made for all open years.  Amounts accrued for potential tax assessments totaled $247 million at December31, 2005
and were recorded in non-current liabilities. Amounts accrued at December31, 2004 totaled $225 million. Accruals relate to U.S. federal tax matters and taxation of foreign earnings and include items such as the tax benefits from the FSC and
Extraterritorial Income ETI regimes, the amount of research tax credits, allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, issues related to various acquisitions and divestitures, and various other federal and foreign tax issues. Amounts
asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than the Companys accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying
matters are settled.  The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the
Act repealed and provided transitional relief for the ETI regime for transactions after December31, 2004. The Act also provides a deduction for income derived from qualifying domestic production activities that is phased in over
the 2005 2010 period. The deduction is equal to 3% of qualifying income in 2005 and 2006, 6% in 2007, 2008, and 2009, and 9% thereafter. The introduction of legislation proposing a technical correction to the Act accompanied by language in
recently issued proposed regulations consistent with the technical correction have substantially diminished concerns existing in prior periods that U.S. government contractors might be denied full benefits under the domestic production activities
incentive. The Act also extended the carryover period for foreign tax credits from 5 to 10 years and reinstated the research and development tax credit. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $42 million in 2004 primarily related to the extension of
the carryover period. 
73 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
In addition, the Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned
abroad by providing a deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations equivalent to 85% of the dividends received. The Company recorded a $5 million tax expense in 2005 in connection with a repatriation of $110 million completed
pursuant to the Act.  Deferred federal and foreign income taxes consisted of
the following at December31:  In millions

There were $3 million of taxes
refundable included in prepaid expenses and other current assets at December31, 2005 and 2004. Federal tax expenses benefits related to discontinued operations were $2 million and $20 million at December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and were included in deferred federal and foreign income taxes in the table above.  At December31, 2005, the Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $90 million that expire in 2009 through 2015, research tax credit carryforwards of $37 million that expire in 2018 through 2025, and
alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $32 million that are carried forward indefinitely. The Company believes it will be able to utilize substantially all of these carryforwards over the next 4 to 5 years.  Note L: Commitments and Contingencies At December31, 2005, the Company had commitments under long-term leases requiring annual rentals on a net lease basis as follows:  In millions 2006 318

Thereafter 212
Rent expense in 2005, 2004, and 2003
was $280 million, $266 million, and $263 million, respectively. In the normal course of business, the Company leases equipment, office buildings, and other facilities under leases that include standard escalation clauses for adjusting rent payments
to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options. 
74 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
At December31, 2005, the Company had commitments under an agreement to outsource a significant portion of its
information technology function requiring minimum annual payments as follows:  In millions 2006 68

2010 Thereafter  In connection with certain aircraft
sales, the Company has offered trade-in incentives whereby the customer will receive a pre-determined trade-in value if they purchase another aircraft from the Company. The difference between the value of these trade-in incentives, the majority of
which expire by the end of 2008, and the current estimated fair value of the underlying aircraft was approximately $4 million at December31, 2005. There is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the likelihood and value of
trade-in commitments.  The Company self-insures for losses and expenses for
aircraft product liability up to a maximum of $10 million per occurrence and $50 million annually. Insurance is purchased from third parties to cover excess aggregate liability exposure from $50 million to $125 billion. This coverage also includes
the excess of liability over $10 million per occurrence. The aircraft product liability reserve was $33 million and $38 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. The
Companys estimate of total environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred is $117 million. Discounted at a weighted-average risk-free rate of 58%, the Company estimates the liability to be $92 million before U.S. government recovery
and had this amount accrued at December31, 2005. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. The recovery of environmental cleanup costs from the U.S.
government is considered probable based on government contracting regulations and the Companys long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs. Accordingly, the Company has recorded $51 million at December31, 2005 for the
estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government, which is included in contracts in process. The Company leases certain government-owned properties and is generally not liable for environmental remediation at these sites, therefore,
no provision has been made in the financial statements for these costs. Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance
coverage, and the unresolved extent of the Companys responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, however, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Environmental
remediation costs expected to be incurred are:  In millions 2006 25

The Company issues guarantees and has banks and surety companies issue, on its behalf, letters of credit and surety
bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of the Company or its affiliates. Approximately $312 million, $767 million, and $78 million of these guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds, for
which there were stated values, were outstanding at December31, 2005, respectively, and $294 million, $827 million, and $250 million were outstanding at December31, 2004, respectively. These instruments expire on various dates through
2015. Included in guarantees and letters of credit above was $76 million and $183 million at December31, 2005, respectively and $43 million and $153 million at December31, 2004, respectively related to the Companys joint venture in
Thales-Raytheon Systems TRS. Also, included in guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds above was $94 million, $8 million, and $62 million at December31, 2005, respectively and $94 million, $9 million, and $234 million at
December31, 2004, respectively related to discontinued operations. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding.  The Company provides these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in connection with
obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts, and performing their contractual obligations. While the Company expects these entities to satisfy their loans, project performance, and other contractual obligations, their
failure to do so may result in a future obligation for the Company.  In
connection with the order for 50 Hawker 4000 aircraft received by RAC in 2005, which is subject to the negotiation and execution of a mutually agreeable parent guarantee, RAC will be subject to liquidated damages of approximately $80 million if it
fails to deliver at least 30 aircraft in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Under the agreement, RAC is also providing a guaranteed maintenance program which runs for ten years from the delivery date of each Hawker 4000 aircraft and
provides for a guaranteed cost of maintenance, subject to annual CPI and other adjustments, for each aircraft. RAC is responsible for any costs that exceed the guaranteed cost of maintenance.  The customers of Flight Options FO, in certain instances, have the contractual ability to
require FO to buy back their fractional share based on its current fair market value. The estimated value of this potential obligation was $575 million and $572 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  RAAS has exposure to outstanding financing arrangements for commuter aircraft, with the
aircraft serving as collateral for these arrangements. Commuter aircraft customers of RAAS are generally thinly capitalized companies whose financial condition could be significantly affected by sustained higher fuel costs, industry consolidation,
and declining commercial aviation market conditions. At December31, 2005 and December31, 2004, the Companys exposure on commuter aircraft assets was approximately $509 million relating to 253 aircraft and approximately $614 million
relating to 297 aircraft, respectively. The carrying value of commuter aircraft assets assumes an orderly disposition of these assets. If the Company were to dispose of these assets in an other than orderly disposition, or sell the business in its
entirety, the value realized would likely be reduced.  In 1997, the Company
provided a first loss guarantee of $133 million on $13 billion of U.S. Export-Import Bank loans maturing in 2015 to the Brazilian government related to the System for the Vigilance of the Amazon SIVAM program being performed by the
Companys Network Centric Systems segment. The first interest payment became due and was paid in 2005.  Defense contractors are subject to many levels of audit and investigation. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Department of Defense Inspector General, the
Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice, and Congressional Committees. The Department of Justice, from time to time, has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by the Company. Individually and in the
aggregate, these investigations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Raytheon Aircraft is also subject to oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration
the FAA. The FAA routinely evaluates aircraft operational and safety requirements and is responsible for certification of new and modified aircraft. Future action by the FAA may adversely affect Raytheon Aircrafts financial
position, results of operations, and liquidity, including recovery of its investment in its newer aircraft. 
76 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
As previously reported, the Company has been cooperating with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
the SEC in a formal investigation into the Companys disclosure and accounting practices, primarily related to the commuter aircraft business and the timing of revenue recognition at Raytheon Aircraft during the period from 1997
to 2001. On April15, 2005, the Company announced that it had submitted an offer of settlement to the staff of the SEC, which the staff agreed to recommend to the SEC. The Company, without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, offered to pay a
civil penalty of $12 million and consent to the entry of a cease and desist order with respect to violations of Sections 17a2-3of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 13a and 13b2A-Bof the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and related SEC rules. The proposed settlement is subject to approval by the SEC.  In addition, the SECs investigation of two of the Companys employees in connection with this matter, one of whom served as the Companys Chief Financial Officer from December 2002 until April15, 2005 remains
unresolved. Both individuals remain on administrative leave.  In May 2004,
without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company reached an agreement to settle a securities class action lawsuit originally filed in 1999 on behalf of the Company and all individual defendants. The terms of the settlement include a cash
payment of $210 million and the issuance of warrants for the Companys stock with a stipulated value of $200 million. The warrants will have a five-year term with a strike price of $3750 and will be issued when the settlement proceeds are
distributed to the claimants which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2006. In December 2004, the court approved the settlement, resolving all claims asserted against the Company and the individual defendants. In connection with the
settlement, the Company recorded a charge of $329 million in 2004, of which $325 million was included in other expense, a $410 million accrued expense, and an $85 million receivable for insurance proceeds primarily related to this settlement. The
charge for the settlement will be revised to reflect the actual fair value of the warrants upon issuance. In 2004, the Company paid $210 million into escrow in connection with the settlement. In 2005, the insurance receivable balance was paid in
full. In July 2004, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company and the individual defendants reached an agreement to settle a derivative action related to this class action lawsuit for $4 million. The settlement, which was approved
by the court in July 2005, resolves all claims in the case.  In May 2005,
without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company and individual defendants reached an agreement to settle a class action lawsuit originally filed in 2001. The settlement includes a cash payment by the Company of $39 million, which was paid
into escrow in May 2005. In July 2005, the court approved the settlement which resolves all claims in the case. In November 2005, the Company received approximately $28 million from its insurance carriers towards the settlement and related expenses.
In November 2004, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the individual defendants and the Company reached a tentative agreement to settle a derivative action related to this class action lawsuit for $2 million. The settlement, which was
approved by the court in September 2005, resolves all claims in the case.  In
May 2003, two purported class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of participants in the Companys savings and investment plans who invested in the Companys stock between August19, 1999 and May27, 2003. The two class action
complaints are brought pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA. Both lawsuits are substantially similar and have been consolidated into a single action. In April 2004, a second consolidated amended complaint the Second
Consolidated Amended ERISA Complaint was filed on behalf of participants and beneficiaries in the Companys savings and investment plans who invested in the Companys stock since October7, 1998. The Second Consolidated Amended
ERISA Complaint alleges that the Company, its Pension and Investment Group, and its Investment Committee breached ERISA fiduciary duties by failing to: 1prudently and loyally manage plan assets, 2monitor the Pension and Investment
Group and the Investment Committee and provide them with accurate information, 3provide complete and accurate information to plan participants and beneficiaries, and 4avoid conflicts of interest. In October 2004, the defendants filed
a motion to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended ERISA Complaint. In September 2005, the court heard the motion to dismiss but declined to decide the motion subject to a trial on a statute of limitations issue, which is scheduled for June 2006.
Although the Company believes that it and the other defendants have meritorious defenses and intends to contest this lawsuit vigorously, an adverse resolution of this lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
position, results of operations, and liquidity. The Company is not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to this lawsuit. 
77 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
In addition, various claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending
or threatened against the Company. While the ultimate liability or potential range of loss, if any, from these proceedings is presently indeterminable, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  Note M: Employee Stock Plans
The 2001 Stock Plan and 1995 Stock Option Plan provide for the grant of both incentive and nonqualified stock options at an exercise price which is not
less than 100% of the fair value on the date of grant. The 1991 Stock Plan provided for the grant of incentive stock options at an exercise price which was 100% of the fair value on the date of grant and nonqualified stock options at an exercise
price which may have been less than the fair value on the date of grant. The 1976 Stock Option Plan provided for the grant of both incentive and nonqualified stock options at an exercise price which was 100% of the fair value on the date of grant.
No further grants are allowed under the 1995 Stock Plan, 1991 Stock Plan or 1976 Stock Option Plan. All of these plans were approved by the Companys stockholders.  Stock options granted under the plans may generally be exercised in their entirety from 1 to 6 years after the date of grant. Incentive
stock options terminate 10 years from the date of grant, and those stock options granted after December31, 1986 become exercisable to a maximum of $100,000 per year. Nonqualified stock options terminate 11 years from the date of grant, 10
years and a day if issued in connection with the 1995 Stock Option Plan, or as determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors MDCC if issued under the 2001 Stock Plan.  Awards of restricted stock units under the Companys LTPP will be made from the 2001
Stock Plan. The performance goals for both the 2004 2006 LTPP and the 2005 2007 LTPP are independent of each other and equally weighted, and are based on two metrics: free cash flow, as defined, and total shareholder return relative to
a peer group both over a three-year period. The ultimate award, which is determined at the end of the three-year performance cycle, can range from zero to 200% of the target award. The target award outstanding at December31, 2005 related to
2005 and 2004 was 473,500 units and 573,800 units, respectively. The amount of compensation expense recorded was $15 million in 2005 and $8 million in 2004.  The 2001 Stock Plan also provides for the award of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights. The 1997 Nonemployee Directors Restricted Stock
Plan provides for the award of restricted stock to nonemployee directors. Awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are made by the MDCC and are compensatory in nature. These awards vest over a specified
period of time as determined by the MDCC, generally 4 years. Restricted stock awards entitle the recipient to full dividend and voting rights. Unvested shares are restricted as to disposition and subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances.
No further grants are allowed under the 2001 Stock Plan or the 1997
Nonemployee Directors Restricted Stock Plan after January30, 2011 and November25, 2011, respectively.  Awards of 2,098,500, 1,875,600, and 314,800 shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units were made to employees and non-employee directors at a weighted-average
fair value at the grant date of $3904, $3508, and $3002 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The required conditions for 227,500, 446,100, and 200,100 shares of restricted stock and restricted units were satisfied during 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. There were 115,100; 122,900; and 13,000 shares of restricted stock forfeited during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. There were 4,003,100, 2,247,300, and 940,600 shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding at
December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The amount of compensation expense recorded was $45 million, $16 million, and $8 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.  There were 478million, 466million, and 532million additional shares of common stock including shares held in treasury
authorized for stock option, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit awards at December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Note N: Pension and Other Employee Benefits The Company has pension plans covering the majority of its employees, including certain employees in foreign countries Pension Benefits. In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain health
care and life insurance benefits to retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans Other Benefits. Substantially all of the Companys U.S. employees may become eligible for the Other Benefits. Effective January1, 2004, the
Company changed the measurement date for its Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans from October31 to December31. This change in measurement date was accounted for as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of this
change in accounting principle was a gain of $53 million pretax for Pension Benefits and a gain of $10 million pretax for Other Benefits. Using the Companys year end as the measurement date for Pension Benefits and Other Benefit plans more
appropriately reflects the plans financial status for the years then ended. In 2004, the total cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was a gain of $63 million pretax, $41 million after-tax, or $009 per basic and diluted
share.  The following adjusts reported income from continuing operations and

The strategic asset allocation of the
Companys domestic Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans is diversified with an average and moderate level of risk consisting of investments in equity securities including domestic and international equities and the Companys common
stock, debt securities, real estate, and other areas such as private equity and cash. The Company seeks to produce a return on investment over the long-term commensurate with levels of investment risk which are prudent and reasonable given the
prevailing capital market expectations. Policy range allocations are 50 to 75% for equity securities, 20 to 40% for debt securities, 2 to 7% for real estate, and 2 to 17% for other areas. The long-term return on asset assumption for the
Companys domestic Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans for 2006 is 875%. The long-term return on asset assumption for the Companys domestic Pension Benefits plans was 875% in 2005, 2004 and 
80 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
2003. The long-term return on asset assumption for the Companys Other Benefits plans was 875% in 2005 and 775% in 2004 and 2003. To develop the
expected long-term rate of return on asset assumptions, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the Company has
invested domestic Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plan assets, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. Since the Companys investment policy is to employ active management strategies in all asset classes, the potential
exists to outperform the broader markets; therefore, the expected returns were adjusted upward. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the long-term return on asset assumptions.
The long-term return on asset assumptions for foreign Pension Benefits plans
are based on the asset allocations and the economic environment prevailing in the locations where the Pension Benefits plans reside. Foreign pension assets do not make up a significant portion of the total assets for all of the Companys
Pension Benefits plans.  The tables below detail assets by category for the
Companys domestic and foreign Pension Benefits and Other Benefits plans. These assets consist primarily of publicly-traded equity securities and publicly-traded fixed income securities.  Pension Benefits Asset Information

The effect of a 1% increase or
decrease in the assumed health care trend rate for each future year for the aggregate of service cost and interest cost is $3 million or $3 million, respectively, and for the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is $35 million or $45
million, respectively.  The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan
assets for Pension Benefits plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $15,154 million and $10,972 million, respectively, at December31, 2005, and $13,763 million and $9,900 million, respectively, at

benefit beginning in 2006 and federal subsidies to employers who provide drug coverage to retirees. The Companys net periodic benefit cost was reduced by $3 million in 2004 to reflect the impact of the Legislation in accordance with FASB Staff
Position No. FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as a result of the Legislation
was $45 million. 
84 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Effective July1, 2004, the Company amended its Other Benefits plans to coordinate the Companys retiree
prescription drug coverage with the Legislation beginning in 2006. The amendment eliminated the plans eligibility for the federal subsidies provided under the Legislation, as described above. The effect of the amendment on the Companys
net periodic benefit cost was a $15 million decrease in 2004. The reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as a result of the plan amendment was $125 million.  The Company maintains an employee stock ownership plan ESOP which includes the Companys 401k plan defined contribution plan,
under which covered employees are allowed to contribute up to a specific percentage of their pay. The Company matches the employees contribution, up to a maximum of generally between 3 and 4% of the employees pay Company Match. Prior

$197 million, $180 million, and $159 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.  Prior to January1, 2005, the Company made an annual contribution to the Company stock fund of approximately one-half of one percent of salaries and wages, subject to certain limitations, of most U.S. salaried and hourly employees

forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at their fair value. Unrealized gains of $51 million were included in noncurrent assets and unrealized losses of $45 million were included in current liabilities. The offset was included in
other comprehensive income, net of tax, of which approximately $3 million of net unrealized losses are expected to be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months as the underlying transactions mature. Gains and losses resulting from these
cash flow hedges offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities being hedged. The maturity dates of the forward exchange contracts outstanding at December31, 2005 extend through 2013. Certain immaterial
contracts were not designated as effective hedges and therefore were included in other expense. The amount charged to other expense related to these contracts was less than $1 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003.  The Company enters into interest rate swaps, as described in Note H, Notes Payable and
Long-Term Debt. These interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges. There was no hedge ineffectiveness in 2005, 2004, or 2003.  Major currencies and the approximate amounts associated with foreign exchange contracts consisted of the following at December31:  2005

payments to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts, have maturities at various dates through 2013 as follows: $1,093 million in 2006, $407 million in 2007, $168 million in 2008, $21 million in 2009, and $29
