Item 5.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded
that, as of September 30, 2004, the Company disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended were effective, based on the evaluation of these controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15b or 15d-15b of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to
ensure that all information required to be disclosed in the Company reports
filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods set forth in applicable Securities and Exchange
Commission forms, rules and regulations. In addition, Rofin has reviewed its
internal control over financial reporting and has concluded that there has been
no change in such internal control during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company internal control over financial reporting.                    36                   PART III
