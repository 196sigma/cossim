To the Board of Directors
Dean Foods Company
Dallas, Texas
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dean Foods
Company and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Dean Foods Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation -- Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates -- The preparation of our Consolidated Financial
Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
us to use our judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.
Cash Equivalents -- We consider temporary cash investments with a remaining
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Inventories -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Dairy
and certain specialty products are valued on the first-in, first-out FIFO
method while our pickle inventories are valued using the last-in, first-out
LIFO method. The costs of finished goods inventories include raw materials,
direct labor and indirect production and overhead costs.
Property, Plant and Equipment -- Property, plant and equipment are stated
at acquisition cost, plus capitalized interest on borrowings during the actual
construction period of major capital projects. Also included in property, plant
and equipment are certain direct costs related to the implementation of computer
software for internal use. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as
follows      ASSET        USEFUL LIFE
Buildings and improvements Seven to 40 years
Machinery and equipment   Three to 20 years   Impairment tests are performed when circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. Capitalized leases are amortized over the
shorter of their lease term or their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for
repairs and maintenance which do not improve or extend the life of the assets
are expensed as incurred.
Intangible and Other Assets -- Prior to January 1, 2002, intangibles were
amortized over their related estimated useful lives as follows       ASSET                     USEFUL LIFE
Goodwill               Straight-line method over 25 to 40 years
Identifiable intangible
assets:
Customer lists           Straight-line method over seven to ten years
Customer supply contracts     Straight-line method over the terms of the agreements
Trademarks/trade names       Straight-line method over ten to 40 years
Noncompetition agreements     Straight-line method over the terms of the agreements
Patents              Straight-line method over fifteen years
Deferred financing costs       Interest method over the terms of the related debt   Effective January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets
determined to have indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized. Instead, we
will now conduct annual impairment tests on our goodwill, trademarks and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives. To determine whether an impairment
exists, we use a present value technique. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we
conducted transitional impairment tests and recorded certain

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
impairments. Impairment tests are performed when circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. See Note 7.
Foreign Currency Translation -- The financial statements of our foreign
subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. The functional currency of our
foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency of the country.
Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated
to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are
translated at the average rates prevailing during the year. Changes in exchange
rates, which affect cash flows and the related receivables or payables are
recognized as transaction gains and losses in the determination of net income.
The cumulative translation adjustment in stockholders' equity reflects the
unrealized adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of
our foreign subsidiaries.
Minority Interest in Subsidiaries -- Minority interest in results of
operations of consolidated subsidiaries represents the minority shareholders'
share of the income or loss of various consolidated subsidiaries. The minority
interest in the consolidated balance sheet reflects the original investment by
these minority shareholders in these consolidated subsidiaries, along with their
proportional share of the earnings or losses of these subsidiaries less any cash
distributions made. At December 31, 2002, there were no outstanding minority
interests.
Employee Stock-Based Compensation -- We measure compensation expense for
our stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method and
provide the required pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and
earnings per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in
measuring compensation expense.
We have elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and
related interpretations in accounting for our stock options. All options granted
to date have been to employees, officers or directors. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized since stock options granted were at
exercise prices which approximated or exceeded market value at the grant date.
Had compensation expense been determined for stock option grants using fair
value methods provided for in SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, our pro forma net income and net income per common share would
have been the amounts indicated below                             YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31

yield of 0%; expected option term of four to ten years and risk-free rates
of return as of the date of grant ranging from 603% to 674% based on the
yield of seven-year U.S. Treasury securities.
Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable -- Revenue is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or
determinable, the product has been shipped to the customer and there is a
reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. Revenue is reduced by
sales incentives that are recorded by estimating expense based on our historical
experience. We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30
days, perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customers and maintain allowances
for potential credit losses based on historical experience.
Income Taxes -- All of our wholly-owned U.S. operating subsidiaries are
included in our consolidated tax return. In addition, our proportional share of
the operations of our former majority-owned subsidiaries and certain of our
equity method affiliates, which are organized as limited liability companies or
limited partnerships, are also included in our consolidated tax return. Our
foreign subsidiaries are required to file separate income tax returns in their
local jurisdictions. Certain distributions from these subsidiaries are subject
to U.S. income taxes; however, available tax credits of these subsidiaries may
reduce or eliminate these U.S. income tax liabilities.
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between
amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using currently enacted current tax rates. Deferred tax
assets, including the benefit of net operating loss carry-forwards, are
evaluated based on the guidelines for realization and may be reduced by a
valuation allowance if deemed necessary.
Advertising Expense -- Advertising expense is comprised of media, agency
and production expenses. Advertising expenses are charged to income during the
period incurred, except for expenses related to the development of a major
commercial or media campaign which are charged to income during the period in
which the advertisement or campaign is first presented by the media. Advertising
expenses charged to income totaled $911 million in 2002, $411 million in 2001
and $622 million in 2000. Additionally, prepaid advertising costs were $49
million and $21 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Insurance Accruals -- We retain selected levels of property and casualty
risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers' compensation claims
and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under
conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible
limits. In other areas, we are self-insured with stop-loss coverages. Accrued
liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks
are calculated based upon loss development factors provided by external
insurance brokers and actuaries.
Comprehensive Income -- We consider all changes in equity from transactions
and other events and circumstances, except those resulting from investments by
owners and distributions to owners, to be comprehensive income.

Stock Split -- On February 21, 2002, our Board of Directors declared a
two-for-one split of our common stock, which entitled shareholders of record on
April 8, 2002 to receive one additional share of common stock for each share
held on that date. The new shares were issued after the market closed on April
23, 2002. All of the share numbers in our Consolidated Financial Statements have
been adjusted for all periods to reflect the stock split.
Recent Adoptions of New Accounting Pronouncements -- The Emerging Issues
Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-14, Accounting for Certain Sales
Incentives, became effective for us in the first quarter of 2002. This Issue
addresses the recognition, measurement and income statement classification of
sales incentives that have the effect of reducing the price of a product or
service to a customer at the point of sale. Our historical practice for
recording sales incentives within the scope of this Issue, which has been to
record estimated coupon expense based on historical coupon redemption
experience, is consistent with the requirements of this Issue. Therefore, our
adoption of this Issue had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We adopted EITF Issue No. 01-09, Accounting for Consideration Given By a
Vendor to a Customer in the first quarter of 2002. Under this Issue, certain
consideration paid to our customers such as slotting fees is required to be
classified as a reduction of revenue, rather than recorded as an expense.
Adoption of this Issue required us to reduce reported revenue and selling and
distribution expense for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 by $337
million and $299 million, respectively. There was no change, however, in
reported net income.
In June 2001, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting
for business combinations. Under the new standard, all business combinations
entered into after June 30, 2001 are required to be accounted for by the
purchase method. We have applied, and will continue to apply, the provisions of
SFAS No. 141 to all business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS
No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and
other intangible assets. We adopted SFAS No. 142 in the first quarter of 2002.
See Note 7. SFAS No. 142 also requires that recognized intangible assets with
finite lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. As part
of the adoption, we re-assessed the useful lives and residual values of all
recognized intangible assets.
FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets in August 2001 and it became effective for us in the first
quarter of 2002. SFAS No. 144, which supercedes SFAS No. 121, provides a single,
comprehensive accounting model for impairment and disposal of long-lived assets
and discontinued operations. Our adoption of this standard did not have a
material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements -- In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS
No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This statement requires
that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
recognized in the period in which the associated legal obligation for the
liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The
associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount
of the long-lived asset and amortized over the useful life of the asset. SFAS
No. 143 became effective for us in 2003. We do not expect the adoption of this
pronouncement to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, was issued in April 2002 and
is applicable to fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. One of the
provisions of this technical statement is the rescission of SFAS No. 4,
Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, whereby any gain or
loss on the early extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary
item in prior periods in accordance with SFAS No. 4, which does not

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
meet the criteria of an extraordinary item as defined by APB Opinion 30, must be
reclassified. Adoption of this standard will require us to reclassify
extraordinary losses previously reported from the early extinguishment of debt
as a component of other expense. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we
recorded an extraordinary loss of $43 million, net of an income tax benefit of
$30 million in connection with the early extinguishment of debt.
In June 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement addresses financial accounting
and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and
nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. The statement requires that a liability for
a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred, and is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. Our adoption of this standard will change the
timing of the recognition of certain charges associated with exit and disposal
activities.
On December 31, 2002 FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure, which amends SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 148 which is effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 provides alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method and requires
more prominent and more frequent disclosures in the financial statements about
the effects of stock-based compensation. At this time, we have elected not to
adopt the voluntary expense recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.
In November 2002, FASB issued FASB Interpretation FIN No. 45,
Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN No. 45 clarifies the
requirements of SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies, relating to the
guarantor accounting for and disclosures of certain guarantees issued. FIN No.
45 requires disclosure of guarantees. It also requires liability recognition for
the fair value of guarantees made after December 31, 2002. We will adopt the
liability recognition requirements of FIN No. 45 effective January 1, 2003, and
we do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.
In January 2003, FASB issued FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities. FIN No. 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in
which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling
financial interest or in which equity investors do not bear the residual
economic risks. The interpretation applies to variable interest entities
VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and to VIEs in which an enterprise
obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the fiscal or interim period
beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a variable
interest that was acquired before February 1, 2003. We currently utilize special
purpose limited liability entities to facilitate our receivable-backed loan and
our trust-issued preferred securities. Since their formations, these entities
have been consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting
purposes. Therefore, FIN No. 46 will have no impact on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Reclassifications -- Certain reclassifications have been made to conform
the prior years' Consolidated Financial Statements to the current year
classifications

flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, and the issuance in
2001 of 30,919,056 shares of our common stock with a fair market value of $7394
million.
All acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
as of their respective acquisition dates, and accordingly, only the results of
operations of the acquired companies subsequent to their respective acquisition
dates are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. At the acquisition
date, the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired, including
identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed based on their fair market
values. The excess of the total purchase prices over the fair values of the net
assets acquired represented goodwill. In connection with the acquisitions,
assets were acquired and liabilities were assumed as follows                             YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31

Acquisition of White Wave -- On May 9, 2002, we acquired the 64% equity
interest in White Wave, Inc. that we did not already own. White Wave, based in
Boulder, Colorado, is the maker of SilkR soymilk and other soy-based products,
and had sales of approximately $125 million during the 12 months ended March 31,
2002. Prior to May 9, we owned approximately 36% of White Wave, as a result of
certain investments made by Old Dean beginning in 1999. We purchased the
remaining 64% equity interest for a total price of approximately $1928 million.
Existing management of White Wave has remained in place after the acquisition.
We have agreed to pay White Wave management team an incentive bonus based on
achieving certain sales growth

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
targets by March 2004. The bonus amount will vary depending on the level of
two-year cumulative sales White Wave achieves by the end of March 2004, and is
anticipated to range between $35 million and $40 million. Amounts expected to be
payable under the bonus plan are expensed each quarter based on White Wave
performance during the quarter. See Note 20. For financial reporting purposes,
White Wave financial results are aggregated with Morningstar Foods' financial
results.
Acquisition of Marie -- On May 17, 2002, we bought the assets of Marie
Quality Foods, Marie Dressings, Inc. and Marie Associates, makers of
MarieR brand dips and dressings in the western United States, for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $235 million. Prior to the
acquisition, we licensed the Marie brand to Marie Quality Foods and Marie
Dressings, Inc. for use in connection with the manufacture and sale of dips and
dressings in the western United States. As a result of this acquisition, our
Morningstar/White Wave segment is now the sole owner, manufacturer and marketer
of Marie brand products nationwide.
Acquisition of Dean Foods Company -- On December 21, 2001, we completed our
acquisition of Dean Foods Company Old Dean. Old Dean is now our wholly-owned
subsidiary. Immediately upon completion of the transaction, Old Dean changed its
name to Dean Holding Company and we changed our name to Dean Foods Company. As a
result of the transaction, each share of common stock of Old Dean was converted
into 0858 shares of our common stock and the right to receive $2100 in cash.
The aggregate purchase price recorded was $17 billion, including $7568 million
of cash paid to Old Dean stockholders and common stock valued at $7394 million.
The value of the approximately 31 million common shares issued was determined
based on the average market price of our common stock during the period from
April 2 through April 10, 2001 the merger was announced on April 5, 2001. In
addition, each of the options to purchase Old Dean common stock outstanding on
December 21, 2001 was converted into an option to purchase 1504 shares of our
stock. As discussed below, the holders of these options had the right, during
the ninety day period following the acquisition, to surrender their stock
options to us, in lieu of exercise, in exchange for a cash payment.
We decided to acquire Old Dean for the above-described consideration after
considering a number of factors, including   - The acquisition would result in us becoming the first truly national
dairy and specialty foods company with the geographic reach, management
depth and product mix necessary to meet the needs of large customers, who
can especially benefit from the added services, convenience and value
that a national dairy company can provide   - Combining our businesses would enable us to reduce our costs by pursuing
economies of scale in purchasing, product development and manufacturing,
and by eliminating duplicative costs; and
- Increasing our scale would provide us with greater resources to invest in
marketing and innovation.
Also on December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean,
we purchased Dairy Farmers of America DFA 338% stake in our Dairy Group
for consideration consisting of: 1 approximately $1454 million in cash, and
2 the operations of eleven plants including seven of our plants and four of
Old Dean plants located in nine states where we and Old Dean had overlapping
operations. Also in connection with the transaction, we delivered a contingent
promissory note in the original principal amount of $40 million to secure our
obligation to renew certain of our milk supply agreements with DFA until 2021,
and we agreed to a liquidated damages provision which provides that if we do
not, within a specified period following the completion of our acquisition of
Old Dean, offer DFA the right to supply raw milk to certain of the Old Dean
dairy plants, we could be required to pay liquidated damages. See Note 20 for
further discussion of these obligations. As a result of this transaction, we now
own 100% of our Dairy Group.

In connection with the merger, we entered into a new credit facility and
expanded our receivables-backed loan facility. We used the proceeds from the
credit facility and receivables-backed loan facility to fund the cash portion of
the merger consideration and the acquisition of DFA minority interest, to
refinance certain indebtedness and to pay certain transaction costs. See Note
10.
Old Dean operations and the acquisition of DFA minority interest are
reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements after December 21, 2001.

liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition of Old Dean, and includes the

Of the approximately $237 million of acquired intangible assets,
approximately $2065 million was assigned to trademarks and trade names that are
not subject to amortization and approximately $305 million was assigned to
customer contracts that have a weighted-average useful life of approximately 17
years.
The approximately $152 billion of goodwill was assigned to Old Dean
Dairy Group, NRP and Specialty segments in the amounts of $101 billion, $215
million and $290 million, respectively. None of the goodwill is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes.
The final allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of assets and
liabilities of Old Dean and the related business integration plans was completed
in the fourth quarter of 2002. This final allocation process increased goodwill
by approximately $554 million, primarily as a result of the final determination
of the fair values of depreciable tangible assets and business integration
plans.
The purchase price allocation of Old Dean included a liability for payment
obligations to Old Dean employees related to Old Dean stock options as a result
of the change in control of Old Dean. Under Old Dean stock option agreements,
upon a change in control, employees had the right to surrender their stock
options to us, in lieu of exercise, in exchange for a cash payment during the
ninety day period following the change in control. The required cash payment
varied depending on the type of stock option and the grant date with certain
stock options requiring a cash payment equal to the difference between the
exercise price and the highest closing price of our stock during the sixty day
period beginning thirty days before and ending 30 days after the completion of
the change in control transaction, and certain of the stock option agreements
required a tax gross-up payment upon surrender. Cash payments of approximately
$442 million were made. At the conclusion of the surrender period, the
remaining liability of approximately $305 million was transferred to
stockholders' equity as the underlying stock options remained outstanding.

DEAN FOODS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
We also incurred a change in control obligation of approximately $49
million for payments to 18 officers under Old Dean long-term incentive plan
and transition bonuses to 5 officers of Old Dean, both of which became earned
and payable upon consummation of the merger; and severance obligations of
approximately $175 million related to the termination of certain employees and
officers of Old Dean as a result of the decision to eliminate certain Old Dean
administrative functions.

plant in Denver, Colorado.
Divestitures -- In order to more closely align both our assets and our
management resources with our strategic direction, part of our strategy in 2002
has been to divest certain assets. During 2002, we completed the sale of three
non-core businesses acquired as part of Old Dean Specialty Foods division. On
January 4, 2002, we completed the sale of the stock of DFC Transportation
Company, a contract hauler. On February 7, 2002, we completed the sale of the
assets related to a boiled peanut business, and on October 11, 2002, we
completed the sale of EBI Foods Limited, a U.K.-based manufacturer of powdered
food coatings. Net proceeds from the sale of these three businesses totaled
approximately $289 million.
Discontinued Operations -- On December 30, 2002 we sold our operations in

On December 21, 2001, simultaneously with our acquisition of Old Dean, we
replaced our former credit facilities with a new credit facility. As a result,
we recognized a $43 million extraordinary loss, net of an income tax benefit of
$3 million, for the write-off of deferred financing costs related to the early
retirement of our former credit facilities.
During the first quarter of 2000, we recognized a $5 million extraordinary
gain, net of income tax expense of $28 million, which included the following
items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit
facility   - A $65 million gain, net of income tax expense of $36 million, for
interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair
market value, and
- A $15 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $08 million, for
the write-off of deferred financing costs.

Investment in Consolidated Container Company -- We own a minority interest
in Consolidated Container Company CCC, one of the nation largest
manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and our largest supplier of plastic
bottles and bottle components. We have owned our minority interest since July
1999 when we sold our U.S. plastic packaging operations to CCC.
Since July 2, 1999, our investment in CCC has been accounted for under the
equity method of accounting. During 2001, due to a variety of operational
difficulties, CCC consistently reported operating results that were
significantly weaker than expected, which resulted in significant losses in the
third and fourth quarters. As a result, by late 2001, CCC had become unable to
comply with the financial covenants contained in its credit facility. We
concluded that our investment was impaired and that the impairment was not
temporary, and wrote off our remaining investment during the fourth quarter of
2001. Accordingly, our investment in CCC was recorded at $0 at December 31,
2001.
In February 2002, CCC lenders agreed to restructure CCC credit
agreement to modify the financial covenants, subject to the agreement of CCC
primary shareholders to guarantee certain of CCC indebtedness. Because CCC is
an important and valued supplier of ours, and in order to protect our interest
in CCC, we agreed to provide a limited guarantee of up to $10 million of CCC
revolving credit indebtedness. By late 2002, CCC was again unable to comply with
the terms of its credit agreement. CCC lenders agreed to again restructure
CCC credit agreement, subject to the agreement of CCC primary shareholders
to provide a total of $35 million of additional debt financing to CCC. In the
fourth quarter of 2002, we agreed to
F-15
DEAN FOODS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
loan CCC $10 million of the $35 million in additional financing, in exchange for
cancellation of our pre-existing $10 million guaranty and the receipt of
additional equity. Vestar Capital Partners, majority owner of CCC, loaned CCC
the remaining $25 million. Our loan to CCC is due on December 31, 2007 or upon
the earlier payment in full of CCC senior debt and is secured by a
subordinate lien on certain of CCC assets. The loan is not scheduled to be
repaid until after CCC senior debt has been paid. Therefore, our right to
enforce payment of the loan is limited prior to payment in full of CCC senior
debt. The loan bears interest at the prime rate plus 225%, or the eurodollar
rate plus 325%, at CCC option. Upon maturity of the loan, we will be entitled
to receive a $400,000 fee, plus an additional fee in respect of the unpaid
principal amount of the loan from January 10, 2003 to the maturity date of the
loan, computed at an annual rate of 113%. Because our participation in this
transaction was not in proportion to our ownership interest in CCC, our
ownership interest was diluted from approximately 43% to approximately 40%. On a
fully-diluted basis, our interest is approximately 36%.
Because we made the $10 million loan to CCC, generally accepted accounting
principles required us to recognize a portion of CCC 2002 losses, up to the
amount of the loan. The loan was written off in its entirety in the fourth
quarter of 2002. Accordingly, our investment in CCC was recorded at $0 at
December 31, 2002. Our equity in earnings loss included in our consolidated
statement of income for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $100 million, $237 million
and $113 million, respectively.
Approximately 5% of CCC is owned indirectly by Alan Bernon, a member of our
Board of Directors, and his brother Peter Bernon. Pursuant to our agreements
with Vestar, we control two of the seven seats on CCC Management Committee. We
have long-term supply agreements with CCC to purchase certain of our
requirements for plastic bottles and bottle components from CCC. In 2002, we
spent approximately $1287 million on products purchased from CCC.
Investment in Horizon Organic -- As of December 31, 2002 and 2001 we had an
approximately 13% interest in Horizon Organic Holding Company, one of America
largest organic food companies. We account for this investment under the equity
method of accounting. We believe that we have the ability to influence the
operating policies of Horizon given the size of our investment and the fact that
we control one seat on their Board. Horizon common stock is traded on the
Nasdaq under the symbol HCOW. The quoted stock price ranged from $1229 to
$1870 during 2002. The closing stock price on December 31, 2002 was $1619 per
share, resulting in a market value of our investment of $217 million. Our
investment in Horizon at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $164 million 165 million and $164 million, respectively, and our equity in earnings
included in our consolidated statement of income for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was a
loss of $01 million, income of $01 million, and income of $02 million,
respectively.
Investment in White Wave -- From December 21, 2001 to May 9, 2002, we owned
a 36% interest in White Wave, Inc., maker of SilkR and White WaveR. This
investment was made by Old Dean prior to our acquisition of Old Dean. On May 9,
2002, we acquired the remaining equity interest in White Wave and began
consolidating White Wave results with our financial results.
Investment in Momentx -- As of December 31, 2002 and 2001 we had an
approximately 16% interest in Momentx, Inc. Our investment in Momentx at both
December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $12 million. Momentx is the owner and operator
of dairy.com, an online vertical exchange dedicated to the dairy industry. We
account for this investment under the cost method of accounting. During 2001, we
recorded an impairment charge on this investment of $36 million in Other
income expense, net to reflect the current value of our equity stake based on
their latest financing.

On January 1, 2002 we adopted SFAS No. 142, which requires, among other
things, that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives no
longer be amortized, and that recognized intangible assets with finite lives be
amortized over their respective useful lives. As required by SFAS No. 142, our

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we completed a goodwill impairment
assessment on our goodwill balances during 2002. The results of this test
indicated that the goodwill related to our Puerto Rico reporting unit was
impaired at January 1, 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we determined that
the impairment that existed as of January 1, 2002 was $377 million. As required
by SFAS No. 142, we recorded the impairment in our income statement as the
cumulative effect of accounting change retroactive to the first quarter of 2002.
See Note 2 for information related to the sale of our Puerto Rico operating
unit. Other than our Puerto Rico operations, our annual impairment test, which

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we completed an impairment assessment of
our intangibles with an indefinite useful life, other than goodwill, at January
1, 2002 during the first quarter of 2002. We determined that an impairment of
$473 million, net of income tax benefit of $29 million existed at January 1,
2002. The impairment related to certain trademarks in our Dairy Group and
Morningstar/White Wave segments, and was recorded in the first quarter as the
cumulative effect of accounting change. The fair value of these trademarks was
determined using a present value technique. Our annual impairment test was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2002, and no additional impairment was
identified.
Amortization expense on intangible assets for the years ended December 31,

Senior Credit Facility -- Simultaneously with the completion of our
acquisition of Old Dean, we entered into a new $27 billion credit agreement
with a syndicate of lenders, in replacement of our then existing credit
facilities. Our new senior credit facility provides an $800 million revolving
line of credit, a Tranche A $900 million term loan and a Tranche B $1 billion
term loan. Upon completion of the Old Dean acquisition, we borrowed $19 billion
under this facility term loans. At December 31, 2002 there were outstanding
term loan borrowings of $183 billion under this facility. The revolving line of
credit was undrawn, except for $718 million of issued but undrawn letters of
credit. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $7282 million was available for
future borrowings under the revolving credit facility, subject to satisfaction
of certain conditions contained in the loan agreement. We are currently in
compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement.
Credit Facility Terms -- Amounts outstanding under the revolving line of
credit and the Tranche A term loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
one of the following rates, at our option   - a base rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis
points or the prime rate, plus a margin that varies from 25 to 150 basis
points, depending on our leverage ratio which is the ratio of defined
indebtedness to defined EBITDA, or
- the London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR computed as LIBOR divided by
the product of one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, plus a margin
that varies from 150 to 275 basis points, depending on our leverage
ratio.
On April 30, 2002, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility
pursuant to which the interest rate for amounts outstanding under the Tranche B
term loan was lowered by 50 basis points, to the following, at our option   - a base rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis
points or the prime rate, plus a margin that varies from 75 to 150 basis
points, depending on our leverage ratio, or
- LIBOR divided by the product of one minus the Eurodollar Reserve
Percentage, plus a margin that varies from 200 to 275 basis points,
depending on our leverage ratio.

The blended interest rate in effect on borrowings under the senior credit
facility, including the applicable interest rate margin, was 365% at December
31, 2002. However, we had interest rate swap agreements in place that hedged
$108 billion of our borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2002 at an
average rate of 54%, plus the applicable interest rate margin. Interest is
payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period.
The agreement requires principal payments on the Tranche A term loan as
follows   - $1687 million quarterly from March 31, 2002 through December 31, 2002   - $3375 million quarterly from March 31, 2003 through December 31, 2004   - $3938 million quarterly from March 31, 2005 through December 31, 2005   - $450 million quarterly from March 31, 2006 through December 31, 2006   - $5625 million quarterly from March 31, 2007 through June 30, 2007; and
- A final payment of $1125 million on July 15, 2007.
The agreement requires principal payments on the Tranche B term loan as
follows   - $125 million quarterly from March 31, 2002 through December 31, 2002   - $25 million quarterly from March 31, 2003 through December 31, 2007   - A payment of $4725 million on March 31, 2008; and
- A final payment of $4725 million on July 15, 2008.
No principal payments are due on the revolving line of credit until
maturity on July 15, 2007.
The credit agreement also requires mandatory principal prepayments in
certain circumstances including without limitation: 1 upon the occurrence of
certain asset dispositions not in the ordinary course of business, 2 upon the
occurrence of certain debt and equity issuances when our leverage ratio is
greater than 375 to 10, and 3 beginning in 2003, annually when our leverage
ratio is greater than 30 to 10. The credit agreement requires that we prepay
50% of defined excess cash flow for any fiscal year beginning in 2003 in which
our leverage ratio at year end is greater than 375 to 10. As of December 31,
2002, our leverage ratio was 33 to 10.
In consideration for the revolving commitments, we pay a commitment fee on
unused amounts of the $800 million revolving credit facility that ranges from
375 to 50 basis points, depending on our leverage ratio.
The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive
covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a
leverage ratio computed as the ratio of the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of defined indebtedness to defined EBITDA and an interest coverage ratio
computed as the ratio of defined EBITDA to interest expense. In addition, this
facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth as defined by
the agreement.

the total cash consideration is not greater than $300 million, 3 we acquire at
least 51% of the acquired entity, and 4 the transaction is approved by the
Board of Directors or shareholders, as appropriate, of the target. All other
acquisitions must be approved in advance by the required lenders.
Our credit agreement also permits us to repurchase stock under our open
market share repurchase program, provided that, if our leverage ratio is greater
than 375 to 10, total Restricted Payments as defined in the agreement, which
definition includes stock repurchases cannot exceed $50 million per year, plus
the amount of payments required to be made on our outstanding convertible
preferred securities during that year.
The facility also contains limitations on liens, investments and the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, and prohibits certain dispositions of
property and restricts certain payments, including dividends. The credit
facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets
including the assets of our subsidiaries, but excluding the capital stock of
Old Dean subsidiaries and certain real property owned by Old Dean and its
subsidiaries.
The agreement contains standard default triggers including without
limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other
covenants contained in the agreement, default on certain of our other debt, a
change in control and certain other material adverse changes in our business.
The agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our debt rating.
In December 2002, we executed an amendment to our credit facility to relax
certain restrictions. We paid an aggregate of $21 million to the lenders who
approved the amendment.
Senior Notes -- Old Dean had certain senior notes outstanding at the time
of the acquisition which remain outstanding. The notes carry the following
interest rates and maturities   - $968 million $100 million face value, at 675% interest, maturing in
2005   - $2505 million $250 million face value, at 815% interest, maturing in
2007   - $1843 million $200 million face value, at 6625% interest, maturing in
2009; and
- $1253 million $150 million face value, at 69% interest, maturing in
2017.
The related indentures do not contain financial covenants but they do
contain certain restrictions including a prohibition against Old Dean and its
subsidiaries granting liens on certain of their real property interests and a
prohibition against Old Dean granting liens on the stock of its subsidiaries.
The indentures also place certain restrictions on Old Dean ability to divest
assets not in the ordinary course of business.
Receivables-Backed Loan -- We have entered into a $400 million receivables
securitization facility pursuant to which certain of our subsidiaries sell their
accounts receivable to three wholly-owned special purpose entities intended to
be bankruptcy-remote. The special purpose entities then transfer the receivables
to third party asset-backed commercial paper conduits sponsored by major
financial institutions. The assets and liabilities of these three special
purpose entities are fully reflected on our balance sheet, and the
securitization is treated as a borrowing for accounting purposes. During 2002,
we made net payments of $255 million on this facility leaving an outstanding
balance of $145 million at December 31, 2002. The
F-24
DEAN FOODS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
receivables-backed loan bears interest at a variable rate based on the
commercial paper yield as defined in the agreement. Our ability to re-borrow
under this facility is subject to a standard borrowing base formula. At
December 31, 2002, we could have re-borrowed an additional $180 million under
this facility.
Foreign Subsidiary Term Loan -- In connection with our acquisition of Leche
Celta in February 2000, our Spanish subsidiary obtained a 421 million euro as
of December 31, 2002, approximately $441 million non-recourse term loan from a
syndicate of lenders, all of which was borrowed at closing and used to finance a
portion of the purchase price. The loan, which is secured by the stock of Leche
Celta, will expire on February 21, 2007, bears interest at a variable rate based
on the ratio of Leche Celta debt to EBITDA as defined in the corresponding
loan agreement, and requires semi-annual principal payments. At December 31,
2002, a total of $357 million was outstanding under this facility.
Other Lines of Credit -- Leche Celta, our Spanish subsidiary, is our only
subsidiary with its own lines of credit separate from the credit facilities
described above. Leche Celta primary line of credit, which is in the principal
amount of 15 million euros as of December 31, 2002 approximately $157
million, was obtained on July 12, 2000, bears interest at a variable interest
rate based on the ratio of Leche Celta debt to EBITDA as defined in the
corresponding loan agreement, is secured by our stock in Leche Celta and will
expire in June 2007. Leche Celta also utilizes other local commercial lines of
credit and receivables factoring facilities. At December 31, 2002, a total of
$119 million was outstanding on these facilities.
Industrial Development Revenue Bonds -- Certain of our subsidiaries have
revenue bonds outstanding, some of which require nominal annual sinking fund
redemptions. Typically, these bonds are secured by irrevocable letters of credit
issued by financial institutions, along with first mortgages on the related real
property and equipment. Interest on these bonds is due semiannually at interest
rates that vary based on market conditions.
Other Subsidiary Debt -- Other subsidiary debt includes various promissory
notes for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment and capital lease
obligations. The various promissory notes payable provide for interest at
varying rates and are payable in monthly installments of principal and interest
until maturity, when the remaining principal balances are due. Capital lease
obligations represent machinery and equipment financing obligations which are
payable in monthly installments of principal and interest and are collateralized
by the related assets financed.
Letters of Credit -- At December 31, 2002 there were $718 million of
issued but undrawn letters of credit secured by our senior credit facility. In
addition to the letters of credit secured by our credit facility, an additional
$49 million of letters of credit were outstanding at December 31, 2002. The
majority of these letters of credit were required by various utilities and
government entities for performance and insurance guarantees.
Interest Rate Agreements -- We have interest rate swap agreements in place
that have been designated as cash flow hedges against variable interest rate
exposure on a portion of our debt, with the objective of minimizing our interest
rate risk and stabilizing cash flows. These swap agreements provide hedges for
loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest
rates specified in the senior credit facility at the interest rates noted below
until the indicated expiration dates of these interest rate swap agreements.

been designated as hedges against interest rate exposure on loans under our

consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with an offset to other comprehensive
income to the extent the hedge is effective. Derivative gains and losses
included in other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings as the
underlying transaction occurs. Any ineffectiveness in our hedges is recorded as
an adjustment to interest expense.
As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our derivative liability totaled $804
million and $441 million on our consolidated balance sheet respectively. This
balance includes approximately $428 million and $278 million recorded as a
component of accounts payable and accrued expenses at December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively and $376 million and $163 million recorded as a component
of other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
There was no hedge ineffectiveness, as determined in accordance with SFAS No.
133, for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Approximately
$24 million and $69 million of losses net of taxes were reclassified to
interest expense from other comprehensive income during the years ended December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We estimate that approximately $27 million of
net derivative losses net of income taxes included in other comprehensive
F-26
DEAN FOODS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
income will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. These
losses will partially offset the lower interest payments recorded on our
variable rate debt.
We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the
possibility of interest rates on the credit facilities falling below the rates
on our interest rate swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is
remote since the counterparties to our interest rate swap agreements are major
financial institutions.
11. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE TRUST ISSUED PREFERRED SECURITIES
On March 24, 1998, we issued $600 million of company-obligated 55%
mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a Delaware business
trust subsidiary in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers
under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 55% preferred
securities, which are recorded net of related fees and expenses, mature 30 years
from the date of issue. Holders of these securities are entitled to receive
preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 55% of their
liquidation preference of $50 each. These distributions are payable quarterly in
arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. These trust
issued preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holders into an
aggregate of approximately 153 million shares of our common stock, subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances, at a conversion price of $3913. These
preferred securities are also redeemable, at our option, at any time at
specified premiums and are mandatorily redeemable at their liquidation
preference amount of $50 per share at maturity or upon occurrence of certain
specified events. See Note 24.
12. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Our authorized shares of capital stock include 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock and 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $01
per share.
Stock Award Plans -- We currently have two stock award plans with shares
remaining available for issuance. These plans, including our 1997 Stock Option
and Restricted Stock Plan and the 1989 Old Dean Stock Awards Plan which we
adopted upon completion of our acquisition of Old Dean, provide for grants of
stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to employees,
officers, directors and, in some cases, consultants, up to a maximum of 25
million and approximately 38 million shares, respectively. Approximately 66
million and 08 million shares remained available for issuance under the 1997
and 1989 plans, respectively, as of March 25, 2003. Options and other
stock-based awards vest in accordance with provisions set forth in the
applicable award agreements.

Defined Contribution Plans -- Certain of our non-union personnel may elect
to participate in savings and profit sharing plans sponsored by us. These plans
generally provide for salary reduction contributions to the plans on behalf of
the participants of between 1% and 17% of a participant annual compensation
and provide for employer matching and profit sharing contributions as determined
by our Board of Directors. In addition, certain union hourly employees are
participants in company-sponsored defined contribution plans which provide for
employer contributions in various amounts ranging from $21 to $39 per pay period
per participant.
Multi-Employer Pension Plans -- Certain of our subsidiaries contribute to
various multi-employer union pension plans, which are administered jointly by
management and union representatives and cover substantially all full-time and
certain part-time union employees who are not covered by our other plans. The
Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 amended ERISA to establish
funding requirements and obligations for employers participating in
multi-employer plans, principally related to employer withdrawal

liable for unfunded vested benefits or other expenses of jointly administered
union/management plans. At this time, we have not established any liabilities
because withdrawal from these plans is not probable or reasonably possible.
15. POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
Certain of our subsidiaries provide health care benefits to certain
retirees who are covered under specific group contracts. As defined by the
specific group contract, qualified covered associates may be eligible to receive
major medical insurance with deductible and co-insurance provisions subject to
certain lifetime maximums.

Plant Closing Costs -- As part of an overall integration and cost reduction
strategy, we recorded plant closing and other non-recurring costs during 2002,
2001 and 2000 in the amount of $191 million, $96 million and $27 million,
respectively. In addition, our share of Consolidated Container Company
restructuring charges were expenses of $17 million and income of $08 million
during 2001 and 2000, respectively. These amounts were reported as an adjustment
to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.
The charges recorded during 2002 are related to the closing of Dairy Group
plants in Bennington, Vermont and Toledo, Ohio, a Dairy Group distribution
facility in Winchester, Virginia, and one Morningstar plant in Tempe, Arizona.
The charges also reflect additional costs related to severance on the closing of
our dairy plant in Port Huron, Michigan in 2001, the shutdown of an ice cream
production line at our Englewood, Colorado plant and the closing of a plant
administrative offices in Grand Rapids, Michigan in our Dairy Group.
During 2001, we recorded charges related to the closing of three Dairy
Group plants with consolidation of production into other plants. The plants
closed during 2001 were our processing facilities in Canton, Mississippi, Corpus
Christi, Texas and Port Huron, Michigan.
The charges recorded for our integration and cost reduction programs in
2000 reflect several approved efficiency and integration efforts including
restructuring of our corporate office departments and closing of our Hartford,
Connecticut plant.
The principal components of these plans include the following   - Workforce reductions as a result of plant closings, plant
rationalizations and consolidation of administrative functions. The plans
included an overall reduction of 451 people in 2002, 198 people in 2001
and 114 people in 2000, who were primarily plant employees associated
with the plant closings and rationalization. The costs were charged to
our earnings in the period that the plan was established in detail and
employee severance and benefits had been appropriately communicated. All
except 66 employees had been terminated as of December 31, 2002   - Shutdown costs, including those costs that are necessary to prepare the
plant facilities for closure                    F-36
DEAN FOODS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
- Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination
costs, utilities and property taxes; and
- Write-downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily
for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no longer used
in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned buildings, land
and equipment at the facilities which are being sold and were written
down to their estimated fair value. The effect of suspending depreciation
on the buildings and equipment related to the closed facilities was not
significant. The carrying value of closed facilities at December 31, 2002
was approximately $35 million. We are marketing these properties for
sale. Divestitures of the closed facilities has not resulted in
significant modification to the estimate of fair value.

Acquired Facility Closing Costs -- As part of our purchase price
allocations, we accrued costs in 2002 and 2001 pursuant to plans to exit certain
activities and operations of acquired businesses in order to rationalize

production and reduce costs and inefficiencies. Several plants were closed in
connection with our acquisition of Old Dean. Plants in Atkins, Arkansas and
Cairo, Georgia in the Specialty Foods segment and a plant in Escondido,
California in the Dairy Group were closed. We have also eliminated Old Dean
administrative offices, closed Dairy Group distribution depots in Parker Ford,
Pennsylvania and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, relocated production between plants
and are shutting down two pickle tank yards as part of our overall integration
and efficiency efforts related to our acquisition of Old Dean.
The principal components of the plans include the following   - Workforce reductions as a result of plant closings, plant
rationalizations and consolidation of administrative functions and
offices, resulting in an overall reduction of 839 plant and
administrative personnel. The costs incurred were charged against our
acquisition liabilities for these costs. As of December 31, 2002, 116
employees had not yet been terminated   - Shutdown costs, including those costs that are necessary to clean and
prepare the plant facilities for closure; and
- Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination
costs, utilities and property taxes after shutdown of the plant or
administrative office.

17. SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES
Our shipping and handling costs are included in both cost of sales and
selling and distribution expense, depending on the nature of such costs.
Shipping and handling costs included in cost of sales reflect the cost of
shipping products to customers through third party carriers, inventory warehouse
costs and product loading and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs
included in selling and distribution expense consist primarily of route delivery
costs for both company-owned delivery routes and independent distributor routes,
to the extent that such independent distributors are paid a delivery fee.
Shipping and handling costs that were recorded as a component of selling and
distribution expense were approximately $9519 million, $6392 million and
$5911 million during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

18. OTHER OPERATING INCOME EXPENSE
During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recognized a net of $173 million of
other operating income which includes the following   - A gain of $475 million on the divestiture of the plants transferred to
National Dairy Holdings as assignee of Dairy Farmers of America in
connection with the acquisition of Old Dean. The gain represented the
difference between fair value and the carrying value of the plants   - An expense of $285 million resulting from a payment to Dairy Farmers of
America as consideration for certain modifications to our existing milk
supply arrangements; and
- An expense of $17 million resulting from the impairment in value of a
water plant.

Leases -- We lease certain property, plant and equipment used in our
operations under both capital and operating lease agreements. Such leases, which
are primarily for machinery, equipment and vehicles, have lease terms ranging
from 1 to 20 years. Certain of the operating lease agreements require the
payment of additional rentals for maintenance, along with additional rentals
based on miles driven or units produced. Rent expense, including additional
rent, was $1245 million, $869 million and $664 million for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Contingent Obligations Related to Milk Supply Arrangements -- On December
21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased Dairy
Farmers of America DFA 338% stake in our Dairy Group. In connection with
that transaction, we issued a contingent, subordinated promissory note to DFA in
the original principal amount of $40 million. DFA is our primary supplier of raw
milk, and the promissory note is designed to ensure that DFA has the opportunity
to continue to supply raw milk to certain of our plants until 2021, or be paid
for the loss of that business. The promissory note has a 20-year term and bears
interest based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash,
but will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a maximum
principal amount of $96 million. We may prepay the note in whole or in part at
any time, without penalty. The note will only become payable if we ever
materially breach or terminate one of our milk supply agreements with DFA
without renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire at the end of 20
years, without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or interest.
Because this note was delivered in connection with our acquisition of DFA
minority interest in our Dairy Group, we originally recorded the note as part of
the purchase consideration and it was reflected on our balance sheet in other
long-term liabilities. However, we now believe that payments we make under this
note, if any, should be expensed as incurred. Accordingly, the purchase
consideration and the note obligation have been removed from our 2001 balance
sheet.
Also as part of the same transaction, we amended a milk supply agreement
with DFA to provide that   - If we have not offered DFA the right to supply all of our raw milk
requirements for certain of Old Dean plants by either i June 2003, or
ii with respect to certain other plants, the end of the 6th full
calendar month following the expiration of milk supply agreements in
existence at those plants on December 21, 2001, or
- If DFA is prohibited from supplying those plants because of an
injunction, restraining order or otherwise as a result of or arising from
a milk supply contract to which we are party we must pay DFA liquidated damages determined and paid on a plant-by-plant
basis, based generally on the amount of raw milk used by that plant, up to an
aggregate maximum of $47 million. Liquidated damages would be payable in arrears
in equal, quarterly installments over a 5-year period, without interest. If we
are required to pay any such liquidated damages, the principal amount of the $40
million subordinated promissory note described above will be reduced by an
amount equal to 25% of the liquidated damages paid. We cannot currently estimate
the amount of damages that we may have to pay, if any.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Contingent Obligations Related to White Wave Acquisition -- On May 9, 2002,
we completed the acquisition of White Wave, Inc. In connection with the
acquisition, we established a Performance Bonus Plan pursuant to which we have
agreed to pay performance bonuses to certain employees of White Wave if certain
performance targets are achieved. Specifically, we agreed that if the cumulative
net sales as defined in the plan of White Wave equal or exceed $3825 million
during the period beginning April 1, 2002 and ending March 31, 2004 the
Incentive Period and White Wave does not exceed the budgetary restrictions
set forth in the plan by more than $1 million during the Incentive Period, we
will pay employee bonuses as follows   - If cumulative net sales during the Incentive Period are between $3825
million and $450 million, the bonus paid will scale ratably meaning
$129,630 for each $1 million of net sales between $26025 million and
$350 million; and
- If cumulative net sales exceed $450 million during the Incentive Period,
additional amounts will be paid as follows    - First $50 million above $450 million net sales: 10% of amount in excess
of $450 million, plus
- Second $50 million above $450 million net sales: 15% of amount in excess
of $500 million, plus
- In excess of $550 million net sales: 20% of amount in excess of $550
million.
We currently expect the aggregate amount of bonuses payable under White Wave
Performance Bonus Plan to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and we
have recorded quarterly accruals based on the aggregate amount that we expect to
pay. Key employees of White Wave are also entitled to receive certain payments
if they are terminated without cause or as a result of death or incapacity
during the Incentive Period.
Contingent Obligations Related to Divested Operations -- We have sold
several businesses in recent years. In each case, we have retained certain known
contingent liabilities related to those businesses and/or assumed an obligation
to indemnify the purchasers of the businesses for certain unknown contingent
liabilities. In the case of the sale of our Puerto Rico operations, we were
required to post collateral, including one surety bond and one letter of credit,
to secure our obligation to satisfy the retained liabilities and to fulfill our
indemnification obligation. We believe we have established adequate reserves for
any potential liability related to our divested businesses. Moreover, we do not
expect any liability that we may have for these retained liabilities, or any
indemnification liability, to be material.
Enron -- In 1999, we entered into an Energy Program Agreement with Enron
Energy Services pursuant to which we contracted to purchase electricity for
certain of our plants at a discounted rate for a ten-year period. Under the
agreement, Enron i supplied or arranged for the supply of utilities to our
facilities and paid the costs of such utilities directly to the utility
suppliers, and ii made certain capital improvements at certain of our
facilities in an effort to reduce our utility consumption, all in exchange for
one monthly payment from us. In November 2001, Enron stopped performing under
the agreement and in December 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection.
Shortly thereafter, Enron rejected our contract. In order to compensate us for
our lost savings, the Energy Program Agreement provided for formula-based
liquidated damages. We have filed a claim in Enron bankruptcy for our damages.
We have received correspondence from Enron demanding payment of certain amounts
that Enron alleges we owe under the agreement. We have disputed the validity of
Enron claim and are in the process of attempting to negotiate an agreement
with Enron for the settlement of our claims against each other. We cannot
estimate the outcome of any settlement with Enron. However, we do not expect the
settlement to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.
Litigation, Investigations and Audits -- We are party, in the ordinary
course of business, to certain other claims, litigation, audits and
investigations. We believe we have adequate reserves for any liability we may

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
incur in connection with any such currently pending or threatened matter. In our
opinion, the settlement of any such currently pending or threatened matter is
not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
21. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Pursuant to SFAS No. 107, Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, we are required to disclose an estimate of the fair value of our
financial instruments as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. SFAS No. 107 defines the
fair value of financial instruments as the amount at which the instrument could
be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.
Due to their near-term maturities, the carrying amounts of accounts
receivable and accounts payable are considered equivalent to fair value. In
addition, because the interest rates on our senior credit facility and most
other debt are variable, their fair values approximate their carrying values.
We have senior notes with an aggregate face value of $700 million with
fixed interest rates ranging from 6625% to 815% at December 31, 2002. These
notes were issued by Old Dean prior to our acquisition of Old Dean, and had a
fair market value of $7028 million at December 31, 2002.
We have entered into various interest rate agreements to reduce our
sensitivity to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt. The fair
values of these instruments and our senior notes were determined based on
current values for similar instruments with similar terms. The following table
presents the carrying value and fair value of our senior notes and interest rate
agreements at December 31                         2002              2001

Segment Information -- We currently have three reportable segments: Dairy
Group, Morningstar/White Wave and Specialty Foods. Our Dairy Group segment
manufactures and distributes fluid milk, ice cream and novelties, half-and-half
and whipping cream, sour cream, cottage cheese, yogurt and dips, as well as
fruit juices and other flavored drinks and bottled water. Morningstar/White Wave
manufactures dairy and non-dairy coffee creamers, whipping cream and pre-whipped
toppings, dips and dressings, specialty products such as lactose-reduced milk
and extended shelf-life milks, as well as certain other refrigerated and
extended shelf-life products. Specialty Foods processes and markets pickles,
powdered products such as non-dairy coffee creamers, aseptic sauces and puddings
and nutritional beverages. We obtained Specialty Foods as part of our
acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Our Spanish operation does not
meet the definition of a segment and is reported in Corporate/Other. Prior
periods have been restated to remove the results of our Puerto Rico operations,
which has been reclassified as a discontinued operation.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on
operating profit not including non-recurring gains and losses and foreign
exchange gains and losses.
We do not allocate income taxes, management fees or unusual items to
segments. In addition, there are no significant non-cash items reported in
segment profit or loss other than depreciation and amortization and the $475
million gain on the divestiture of the 11 plants transferred to National Dairy
Holdings as assignee of Dairy Farmers of America in connection with the
acquisition of Old Dean which is reported in our Dairy

24. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Aircraft Leases --On August 1, 2000, we entered into a five-year aircraft
lease agreement with Neptune Colorado LLC, a limited liability company owned by
Gregg Engles our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of
Directors and Pete Schenkel President of our Dairy Group and also a member of
our Board of Directors. Pursuant to the lease agreement, we agreed to lease an
airplane from Neptune Colorado at a rate of $1,000 per hour for each hour of
flight with a minimum of 40 hours of flight per month. We also agreed to pay a
non-refundable equipment reserve charge equal to $8310 per engine hour used
during the term of the agreement, with reserve funds being used by the lessor
for engine overhauls, removal or replacement during the term of the agreement.
Under the lease, we are responsible for paying certain taxes related to and
insurance for the airplane, as well as operating costs, landing and customs
fees, storage charges and any fines or penalties arising from the operation or
use of the airplane. We paid an aggregate of $05 million in 2002, $06 million
in 2001 and $02 million in 2000 to Neptune Colorado, LLC under the lease.
In June 2001, we entered into a six-year aircraft lease agreement with
Curan, LLC, a limited liability company also owned by Gregg Engles and Pete
Schenkel. Pursuant to the lease agreement, we agreed to lease an airplane from
Curan at a rate of $122,000 per month. We were required to set up a
non-refundable equipment reserve account, the amount of which was determined
periodically by a third party. Reserve funds were used by the lessor for engine
overhauls, removal or replacement during the term of the agreement. We are
responsible for paying certain taxes related to and insurance for the airplane,
as well as operating costs, landing and customs fees, storage charges and any
fines or penalties arising from our operation or use of the airplane. We paid an
aggregate of $16 million and $09 million to Curan, LLC during 2002 and 2001,
respectively.
On March 24, 2003, the independent members of our Board of Directors voted
to purchase Neptune Colorado LLC and Curan, LLC from Messrs. Engles and
Schenkel, after determining that it would be in our best interests to own the
aircraft rather than to lease the aircraft pursuant to the terms of the existing
leases. As consideration for the purchase of the lessor companies from Messrs.
Engles and Schenkel, we will assume the indebtedness that the lessor entities
incurred to finance the purchase of the aircraft. No other consideration will be
paid to Mr. Engles or Mr. Schenkel, directly or indirectly. The aggregate
principal balance of the indebtedness that we will assume is approximately $96
million, which approximates the current fair market value of the aircraft. The
indebtedness is secured by the aircraft. The lessor entities have no assets or
liabilities other than the aircraft, certain cash and the related purchase money
indebtedness. As part of the transaction, we will receive cash in the amount of
approximately $100,000, which is the balance of the
F-46

equipment reserves that were established under the leases. Because the market
value of the assets we will acquire in the transaction is equal to the value of
the liabilities that we will assume, there will be no income statement impact
related to the transaction. We expect to complete the transaction in March 2003.
Securities Repurchases -- On each of January 8, 2003 and February 12, 2003,
our Board of Directors approved $150 million increases to the authorized amount
of our stock repurchase program. Between January 1, 2003 and March 24, 2003, we
spent approximately $129 million to repurchase approximately 324 million shares
of our common stock for an average price of $3972 per share. At March 25, 2003,
approximately $1716 million remains available under our current authorization.
On March 17, 2003, we announced a partial redemption of our trust-issued
preferred securities TIPES. TIPES with an aggregate liquidation value of
$100 million will be redeemed on April 17, 2003 at a redemption price of
$510315 per security. Holders of TIPES that have been called for redemption
have the option to convert their TIPES into shares of our common stock instead
of receiving the cash redemption price. Approximately $500 million of TIPES will
remain outstanding following completion of this partial redemption.
Hedging Transactions -- In January 2003, we entered into forward starting
swaps that began in March 2003 with a notional amount of $400 million. These
swaps all expire in December 2003 and the fixed interest rates range between
147% to 148%. These swaps have been designated as hedges against interest rate
exposure on loans under our senior credit facility.
25. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Real Property Lease -- We lease the land for our Franklin, Massachusetts
plant from a partnership in which Alan Bernon, Chief Operating Officer of the
Northeast region of our Dairy Group and a member of our Board of Directors, owns
a 1345% minority interest. The remaining interests are owned by members of Mr.
Bernon family. The lease payments totaled $07 million in 2002 and $06
million in each of 2001 and 2000.
Minority Interest in Consolidated Container Holding Company -- We hold our
minority interest in Consolidated Container Company through our subsidiary
Franklin Plastics, Inc., in which we own an 895% interest. Alan Bernon, Chief
Operating Officer of the Northeast region of our Dairy Group and a member of our
Board of Directors, and his brother, Peter Bernon, collectively own the
remaining 105% of Franklin Plastics, Inc.
Aircraft Leases -- See Note 24.
