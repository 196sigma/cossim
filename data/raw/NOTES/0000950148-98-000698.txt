ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors
CyberMedia, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CyberMedia,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1997. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CyberMedia,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

CYBERMEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Pooling of Interests
CyberMedia, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation, develops and
markets software products that provide automatic service and support to PC users
in the Windows environment. Products are principally sold to distributors and
directly to consumers. The Company also markets its products internationally
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, CyberHelp Ltd. in Ireland and CyberMedia
KK in Japan and through certain distribution and licensing agreements. For the
years ended 1996 and 1997, approximately 10% and 19%, respectively, of the
Company net revenues were from international sales. Prior to 1996,
international sales were less than 5% of net revenues. In 1997, European
business accounted for 13%, 4% and 4% of the Company net revenues, loss before
taxes and net loss, respectively. Assets located in Europe were less than 10% of
total assets in 1996 and 1997.
In April 1997, the Company acquired, in a transaction accounted for as a
pooling of interests, all of the outstanding shares of Walk Softly, Inc. 122,468
shares of common stock were issued in connection with this acquisition. The
results of operations of Walk Softly, Inc. were insignificant; accordingly,
results of operations for periods prior to the transaction have not been
restated.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments having original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities
Marketable securities, considered by the Company to be available-for-sale,
consist primarily of bankers' acceptances and commercial paper of large U.S.
corporations. The securities are stated at cost, which approximates market.
Inventory
Inventory, consisting of software product and related packaging materials,
is stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. Inventory
is shown net of valuation allowances of $430,000 and $74,000 at December 31,
1996 and 1997, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are generated from sales of software to distributors, resellers
and end-users and are recognized upon shipment of products, net of provisions
for estimated future returns and price protection, provided that no significant
vendor obligations remain and collection of accounts receivable is deemed to be
probable. On sales of products having remaining vendor obligations, a portion of
related revenue is deferred based upon the relative retail value of future
obligations and recognized ratably over the estimated period for which
obligations exist, generally one year from the date of sale.
The Company provides routine telephone customer support as an accommodation
to purchasers of its products for a limited time. Costs associated with such
post-sale customer support were immaterial.

CYBERMEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA released Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition
SOP 97-2. Among other things, SOP 97-2 eliminates the distinction between
significant and insignificant vendor obligations promulgated by SOP 91-1 and
requires each element of a software arrangement to meet certain criteria in
order to recognize revenue allocated to that element. Additionally, SOP 97-2
requires that total fees under an arrangement be allocated to each element in
the arrangement based upon vendor specific objective evidence, as defined. SOP
97-2 is effective for software transactions entered into by the Company in
fiscal 1998 and subsequent periods.
As a result of certain issues raised in applying SOP 97-2, the AICPA issued
a Statement of Position which will delay for one year the effective date of
certain provisions of SOP 97-2 with respect to what constitutes vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value of the delivered software element in certain
multiple-element arrangements that include service elements entered into by
entities that never sell the software elements separately. The Company does not
anticipate that the adoption of SOP 97-2 and the new SOP will have a material
effect on the Company results of operations. However, the ultimate resolution
of the implementation issues referred to above, or additional issues not yet
raised or addressed by the AICPA, could change the Company expectation.
Revenue Related Allowances
Allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts are established based
upon historical experience and management estimates as shipments are made. The
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts aggregated $1,523,000 and
$15,749,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively, and is shown as a
reduction of accounts receivable on the accompanying balance sheets. The
allowance for sales returns includes the Company estimation of costs related
to its price protection policy. Such costs have historically been immaterial.
Unearned Revenues
The Company offers customers update rights for certain products at no
additional cost. As a result, ratable revenue recognition is appropriate for a
portion of the license fees for such products. Accordingly, unearned revenues on
the accompanying balance sheets represent Internet and other product updates and
other unspecified future support commitments which will be recognized ratably
over the estimated update periods, generally twelve months.
Research and Development and Purchased In-Process R & D
Costs relating to designing, developing and testing new software products
are expensed as research and development as incurred. Although costs incurred
subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of software products are to
be capitalized pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 86 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or
Otherwise Marketed, the Company has not capitalized any software development
costs since the impact to the financial statements for all periods presented has
been immaterial.
The Company has acquired certain software code, including non-exclusive
rights to use software code developed by others, with the intent to incorporate
such purchased technology in future products. Where such purchased technology
rights are determined to have no alternative future use other than in
development of future products, the Company expenses amounts paid. During 1997,
the Company expensed an aggregate of $11,341,000 in connection with two
acquisitions of such in process research and development.
In the first acquisition, the Company paid cash of $40 million, agreed to
pay additional minimum guaranteed amounts of $45 million and issued warrants to
purchase 150,000 shares of the Company common stock at $913 per share. The
warrants were valued at $750,000 see note 7. In the second

acquisition, the Company paid cash of $11 million and agreed to pay an
additional $13 million in installments due through September 1998.
Depreciation and Amortization
Furniture, fixtures and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of
furniture, fixtures and equipment is calculated on the straight-line
depreciation method over the estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer equipment and purchased
3 years
Office furniture and equipment. 3-4 years
Assets under capital lease. Shorter of lease term or
the estimated useful life
of the asset
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and
liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS No. 109, the
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Computation of Net Loss per Share
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
128, Earnings per Share. The Company has reflected the provisions of SFAS 128 in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
SFAS 128 replaces the presentation of primary Earnings Per Share EPS with a
presentation of basic EPS, which excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. The Statement also requires the dual
presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for
all entities with complex capital structures. Diluted EPS is computed similarly
to fully diluted EPS pursuant to Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No.
15. Due to the losses reported by the Company in each of the last three years,
any potential common shares to be included in diluted earnings per share as a
result of common stock options and warrants are anti-dilutive and thus diluted
earnings per share and basic earnings per share are equal. Potentially dilutive
securities not included in the computation of basic earnings per share consisted
of stock options and warrants outstanding as of December 31, 1997. See Notes 7
and 8.
In February 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 98 which changes the calculation of
earnings per share in periods prior to initial public offerings as previously
applied under SAB No. 83. When a registrant issued common stock, warrants,
options, or other potentially dilutive instruments for consideration or with
exercise prices below the initial public offering price within a one year period
prior to the initial filing of a registration statement relating to an initial
public offering, SAB No. 83 required such equity instruments to be treated as
outstanding for all periods presented in the filing using the anticipated
initial public offering price and the treasury stock method. Under SAB No. 98,
when common stock options, warrants, or other potentially dilutive instruments
have been issued for nominal consideration during the periods covered by income
statements in the filing, those nominal issuances are to be reflected in
earnings per share calculations for all periods presented. Based on the
Company current understanding of the definition of nominal consideration,
the Company has concluded that during all
38
40
CYBERMEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
periods prior to the Company initial public offering, no equity instruments
were issued for nominal consideration. Per share results for periods prior to or
including the Company initial public offering have been restated in accordance
with SAB No. 98.
Financial Instruments
The Financial Accounting Standards Board SFAS No. 107 Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments defines fair value of a financial
instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties. The Company carrying value of cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, grant
payable, capital lease obligations and notes payable approximates fair value
because each instrument has a short-term maturity or because the applicable
interest rates are comparable to current borrowing rates.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable. If the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without
interest charges from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value, a
write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to the appropriate
value.
Use of Estimates
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities to prepare these financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

4 GRANT PAYABLE
In August 1992, the Company received a grant under the Program for the
Advancement of Commercial Technology Provided by the United States Agency for
International Development and administered by the Industrial Credit and
Investment Corporation of India Limited ICICI. As of December 31, 1994, the
Company had received $318,000, which had been allocated to the Company
concurrent with the development of its products. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company is obligated to repay up to $795,000, through royalties
based on product sales, as defined. The Company accrued royalty expense related
to this grant of $276,000 during the year ended December 31, 1995. During the
year ended December 31, 1996, the Company had reduced the royalty amount accrued
to $95,000, which represented the total royalty amount the Company expected to
pay in addition to the original grant amount of $318,000. During 1997, the
Company paid ICICI $409,000 and accrued the remaining $386,000 representing the
maximum amount payable under the terms of the grant.
5 FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
The Company had a revolving line of credit of $3,000,000 bearing interest
at the prime rate plus 1% which expired in April 1997. As of December 31, 1996,
the Company had no outstanding borrowings on this revolving line of credit which
was collateralized by all assets of the Company. The Company was restricted
under the revolving line of credit from declaring or paying a dividend on any of
its capital stock without bank consent. The Company currently has a $1,000,000
unrestricted line of credit which bears interest at the prime rate, and is
collateralized by all assets of the Company. At December 31, 1997 the Company
had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit.
The Company has from time to time utilized receivable based financing made
available by commercial banks including sales of trade accounts receivable to
such commercial banks. Such arrangements are non-recourse, except for sales
returns and marketing credits. On September 30, 1997 the Company sold $4,831,000
of trade accounts receivable without recourse subject to sales returns and
marketing credits. At December 31, 1997, $552,000 of such accounts receivable
remained outstanding; however subsequent to December 31, 1997, such amounts were
satisfied in full.

6 INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes, all current, for the years ended December
31, 1995 and 1996 consists solely of the annual minimum California franchise tax
of approximately $1,000. The tax provision for 1997 is summarized as follows:
CURRENT    DEFERRED    TOTAL
$5,029,000  $3,619,000  $1,410,000
1,080,000       --   1,080,000

Total income tax
expense.  6,201,000  $3,619,000  $2,582,000
Reduction of taxes for stock
option exercises.  1,391,000
Current taxes. $4,810,000
During 1997, the Company recognized tax benefits related to stock option
plans of $1,391,000. Such benefits were recorded as an increase to additional
paid in capital.
The provision for income taxes differs from the expected tax benefit
computed by applying the federal corporate tax rate of 34% to loss before income
taxes principally due to the effect of net operating loss carryforwards in 1995
and 1996. For 1997, the provision for income taxes differs from the expected tax
benefit computed using the federal corporate tax rate of 34% as follows:
Expected income tax  $3,114,000
State tax benefit    562,000
Increase in valuation   7,152,000
Tax   1,007,000

Net deferred tax assets. $    --  $    --  $ 3,619,000
The net change in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31,
1995, 1996 and 1997 was an increase of $1,359,000, $776,000 and $7,152,000,
respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the ability of the Company to recover taxes
previously paid, through carryback of future tax losses or upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
become deductible. Management considers projected future taxable income and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical
taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in
which the level of deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that
it is not more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of all
these deductible differences at December 31, 1996 and 1997. Accordingly,
valuation allowances have been provided against gross deferred tax assets in
order to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount believed by management to be
recoverable through carryback of future expected tax losses to recover taxes
paid in 1997.
The Company had available at December 31, 1997 approximately $3,052,000 of
net operating losses to offset future Federal taxable income that expire
beginning in the year 2006. Use of these net operating losses will be limited
under rules governing changes in ownership of the Company. These rules restrict
the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards which may be used in a
particular year. The maximum amount of net operating loss carryforwards which
are available on an annual basis for use subsequent to the year ended December
31, 1997 is approximately $214,000.
7 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Preferred Stock
During 1995, the Company issued 5,735,715 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock for cash consideration and issued 635,714 shares of Series B Preferred

to issue 2,000,000 shares of Undesignated Preferred Stock.
Common Stock
During October 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering of
its Common Stock whereby 2,500,000 shares were issued at $16 per share resulting
in net proceeds of approximately $37,200,000, after underwriting discounts and
commissions and before other expenses of the offering of $1,224,000.
Additionally, 375,000 shares for the underwriter overallotment were issued at
$16 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $5,580,000, after
underwriter discounts and commissions.
Stock Warrants
During the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1995, the Company issued
warrants for the purchase of a total of 1,766,471 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock at exercise prices ranging from $035 to $070 per share. No value was
ascribed to the warrants because management was of the opinion that the impact
of any such value was negligible to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. These warrants were exercised and converted into 866,152 shares of
Common Stock during the year ended December 31, 1996.
The Company issued warrants for the purchase of 49,644 shares of Common

warrants for the purchase of 70,667 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price
of $450 per share during the year ended December 31, 1996. No value was
ascribed to the warrants because management was of the opinion that the impact
of any such value is negligible to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. Warrants for the purchase of 50,643 shares of Common Stock were
exercised during the year ended December 31, 1996, resulting in the issuance of
46,933 shares of Common Stock. During 1997, 150,000 warrants exercisable at a
price of $913 were issued in connection with the acquisition of certain in
process research and development. These warrants were valued at $750,000 using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which amount was recorded as in process
research and development expense. Warrants for the purchase of 157,000 shares of
Common Stock were exercised during the year ended December 31, 1997 resulting in
the issuance of 154,554 shares of Common Stock. Therefore, as of December 31,

In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which was effective for the
Company beginning January 1, 1996. SFAS No. 123 requires expanded disclosures of
stock-based compensation arrangements with employees and encourages but does
not require compensation cost to be measured based on the fair value of the
equity instrument awarded. Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of stock-based
awards to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models, even
though such models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely
tradeable, fully transferable options without vesting restrictions, which
significantly differ from the Company stock option awards. These models also
require subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and
expected time to exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values. Companies
are permitted, however, to continue to apply APB Opinion No. 25, which
recognizes compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity
instrument awarded. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion No.
25 in accounting for its stock-based compensation arrangements. Had the Company
determined compensation cost
44

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options under SFAS No.
123, the Company net loss and loss per share would have been increased to the
pro forma amounts indicated below:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1995     1996      1997
Net loss
As  $3,352,000 $3,483,000 $11,740,000
Pro  $3,383,000 $4,026,000 $13,622,000
Net loss per share
As  $   256 $   088 $   097
Pro  $   258 $   102 $   112
The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1996 and, 1997 was $008, $211 and $834, respectively,
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: expected volatility of 704% in 1995 and 1996 and 691% in 1997,
risk-free interest rate of 64% in 1995 and 1996 and 55% in 1997, no expected
dividends and an expected life of 4 years.
In early 1997, the Company recorded $750,000 as in process research and
development expense, which was determined to be the value of 150,000 warrants
issued in connection with an acquisition of certain in process technologies. The
value of these warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following assumptions: expected volatility of 704%, risk free
interest rate of 64%, no expected dividends and an expected life of two years.
Pro forma net loss reflects only options granted in 1995, 1996 and 1997.
Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options
under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net loss amounts presented
above because compensation cost is reflected over the option vesting periods of
up to four years and compensation cost for options granted prior to January 1,
1995 is not considered.
During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company issued Common Stock to
certain directors who exercised unvested agreements. As defined more fully in
the stock option agreements, the Company retains the right to purchase such
stock at the original exercise price under terms similar to the original vesting
periods.
In June 1996, the Company Board of Directors approved the 1996 Director
Option Plan. The Plan provides for the automatic and nondiscretionary grant of
nonstatutory stock options to nonemployee directors of the Company who are first
elected to the Board after the adoption of the Director Option Plan outside
directors. A total of 50,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for
issuance under the Director Option Plan. Each outside director elected after the
adoption of the Plan will automatically be granted an option to purchase 5,000
shares on the date on which such person first becomes an outside director
First Option at the fair market value of the Company Common Stock at the
date of grant. Each First Option granted vests ratably over specified periods,
approximately four years, subject to continued service as an outside director.
Thereafter, each outside director will be automatically granted an option to
purchase 5,000 shares on December 1 of each year beginning in 1997, provided he
or she shall have served on the Board for at least six months subsequent
option. Each subsequent option shall have an exercise price equal to the fair
value of the Company Common Stock as of the date of grant and shall be
exercisable ratably over four years, beginning three years and one month from
the date of grant, subject to continued service as an outside director. To date,
no options have been granted under the 1996 Director Option Plan.

9 SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS, CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND OTHER CONCENTRATIONS
Significant Customers
Net sales to certain customers represented 10% or more of the Company net
revenues for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997. Net sales to
these customers were as follows:
FOR THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31,
1995  1996  1997
Company    19%   --    Company    16%   25%   25%
Company    --   25%   25 
Concentration of Credit Risk
Certain financial instruments potentially subject the Company to credit
risk. These financial instruments consist primarily of trade receivables. The
Company sells to distributors, resellers and directly to end-users. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances
for doubtful accounts and estimates of potential future product returns. The
Company three major customers in 1996 represented 34%, 17% and 12 respectively, of trade accounts receivable net, at December 31, 1996. The
