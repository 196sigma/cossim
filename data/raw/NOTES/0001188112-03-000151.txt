ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Elamex, S.A. de C.V. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Elamex, S.A. de
C.V. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial
statements of Qualcore, S. de R.L. de C.V. a consolidated subsidiary during the
year ended December 31, 2000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, which
statements reflect total revenues constituting 17% of the consolidated total
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000. Those statements were audited by
other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar
as it relates to the amounts included for Qualcore, S. de R.L. de C.V. is based
solely on the report of such other auditors. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Elamex, S.A. de C.V. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. DELOITTE & TOUCHE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2002, 2001 AND 2000 IN THOUSANDS OF U.S. DOLLARS
1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
COMPANY BACKGROUND - Elamex, S.A. de C.V. and its subsidiaries Elamex or the
Company are a group of Companies in Mexico and the United States that provide
manufacturing, packaging and distribution services. The Company provides
customized manufacturing services in the candy and nut industry, plastic and
stamped metal components industry and medical industry. The Company
manufacturing machinery and equipment are located in facilities in Ciudad
Juarez, in Mexico, and in Louisville, Kentucky and El Paso, Texas in the United
States.
In July 2002, the Company acquired the new Food Products segment, which is Mt.
Franklin Holdings LLC and subsidiaries Franklin. Franklin operates a retail
nut and foodservice nut packaging and marketing company located in El Paso,
Texas and a candy manufacturing and packaging facility located in Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico see Note 4.
In May 2000, the Company sold its Electronic Manufacturing Services EMS
operation for approximately $512 million and recognized a pre-tax gain on this
sale of approximately $215 million which is included in other income for the
year ended December 31, 2000 see Note 4.
Optimag Inc. Optimag was formed to develop, manufacture, and market optical
inspection stations and electrical test equipment to companies that produce disk
drive heads, magnetic media, and optical heads and optical media. The Company
consolidated the operations of this investment. On October 18, 1999, the Company
sold its interest in Optimag to Veeco Instruments, Inc. for $23 million plus an
earnout based upon sales for calendar year 2000. The Company recognized gains of
$23 million and $826 thousand, which are reflected in the 2001 and 2000 results
of operations, respectively.
The Company is a subsidiary of Accel, S.A. de C.V. Accel, which owns
approximately 576% of the Company issued and outstanding common shares at
December 31, 2002.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION - These consolidated financial statements and the
accompanying notes are prepared in U.S. dollars, the functional and reporting
currency of Elamex.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America U.S. and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
and majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries. The operating results of the EMS
operation after the date of disposition, May 23, 2000, are not included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Effective July 1, 2001, the operating results of Qualcore S. de R. L. de C.V.
Qualcore, a joint venture with General Electric GE, which was previously
consolidated, are being reported on the equity method. This was the result of
the change in management control of the joint venture. As of the beginning of
the third quarter 2001 a new four-member board of directors in which the two
partners have equal voting rights directs the operations of Qualcore. A general
manager appointed by the board of directors, reports directly to such board of
directors.
Financial information for Qualcore for the year ended December 31, 2002 is as
follows                         in Thousands of U.S.
Dollars
Current assets         $       5,398

Net loss            $       2,249
The Company share of undistributed equity in Qualcore at December 31, 2002 was
$2,669
28 MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to
make certain estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
2. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. This statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 142 requires, among
other things, the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives. In addition, the standard includes provisions for
the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles,
reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and
the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential
impairments of goodwill. SFAS No. 142 also requires the Company to complete a
transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption. The
result of the non-amortization provision of SFAS No. 142 was a decrease in the
net loss of $492 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2002.
The Company completed the transitional impairment test and reported an
impairment of goodwill of $853 thousand from the initial adoption of SFAS No.
142 in the first quarter of 2002. After impairment, goodwill remaining on the
books is approximately $118 million of which $37 million was recorded during
the third quarter of 2002 as a result of the acquisition of Mt. Franklin
Holdings See Note 4. The goodwill affected by the impairment analysis is that
recorded at the time of the acquisition of Precision Tool, Die and Machine Co.
in 1999. The Company has elected to annually test goodwill for impairment during
first quarter of the year.
The following table details the proforma transitional disclosures                                  $000s except for earnings-per-share

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. Cash includes deposits in Mexican banks,
denominated in Mexican Pesos, of approximately $262 thousand and $420 thousand
at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company had approximately $87
million and $167 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in
short-term repurchase agreements, denominated in U.S. dollars, deposited in U.S.
banks.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts
receivable. The Company monitors the risk of having deposits in bank in excess
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits and does not anticipate any
losses. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral to support amounts due for the sale of its
products.
ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - The Company maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts based on its best estimate of accounts receivable considered
to be uncollectible.
29 An analysis of the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 is as follows                      2002     2001      2000
In Thousands of US Dollars
Beginning balance        $  649   $   165   $  343
Additions charged to expense     141     1,364     213
Accounts written off        136     880    391
Ending balance          $  654   $   649   $  165
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The functional currency of the Company is the
U.S. dollar, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
Company operates. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and
remeasurement of balance sheet amounts are reflected in net income. Included in
other, net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are foreign
exchange gains losses of $328 thousand, $8 thousand, and $37 thousand for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Assets and
liabilities of the Company are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain
amounts as indicated below. Certain balance sheet amounts primarily
inventories, property, plant and equipment, accumulated depreciation, prepaid
expenses, and common stock denominated in other than U.S. dollars are
remeasured at the rates in effect at the time the relevant transaction was
recorded, and all other assets and liabilities are remeasured at rates effective
as of the end of the related periods. Revenues and expenses denominated in other
than U.S. dollars are remeasured at weighted-average exchange rates for the
relevant period the transaction was recorded. Assets and liabilities denominated
in Pesos are summarized as follows in thousands of U.S. dollars at the exchange
rate published in the Diario Oficial de la Federacion the Official Gazette of
the Federation, which is the approximate rate at which a receivable or payable
can be settled as of each period end                           2002       2001
In Thousands of U.S. Dollars
Cash and cash equivalents         $    262   $    420
Other receivables                1,032      1,792
Prepaid expenses and refundable taxes      1,705      2,681
Other assets, net                  26       30
Accounts payable                 477     1,023
Accrued expenses and other liabilities     1,264     2,435
Net foreign currency position       $   1,284   $   1,465
In addition, the Company has recorded a net deferred tax liability pursuant to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes see Note 10. The recorded net deferred tax asset of $22 million
at December 31, 2002 and 2001, represent the net dollar value of amounts
provided for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective Mexican and U.S.
tax bases.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS - The Company maintains a policy of not engaging in
futures contracts with the purpose of hedging U.S. dollar/Peso revenues or
costs, with the exception of regular treasury operations to cover operating
requirements for up to 30 days. The Company had no open hedge contracts at
December 31, 2002 or 2001.
INVESTMENTS SECURITIES - Includes investments in common stocks held for sale of
non-affiliated companies. Such investments are recorded at fair value as
determined from quoted market prices, and the cost of securities sold is
determined based on the specific identification method. Unrealized gains or
losses are reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss, net of
related tax effects.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in first-out FIFO method for Precision and a moving
weighted average for Franklin. Inventory cost includes material, labor and
overhead. Inventory reserves, which are charged to cost of sales, are provided
for excess inventory, obsolete inventory, and for differences between inventory
cost and its net realizable value. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost, less accumulated depreciation
30 and amortization. Plant and equipment under capital leases are stated at the
lower of their fair value at the inception of the lease or the present value of
minimum lease payments. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the
straight-line method over the shorter of related lease terms or estimated useful
lives of the assets. The Company charges amounts expended for maintenance and
repairs to expense and capitalizes expenditures for major replacements and
improvements.
GOODWILL - Through December 31, 2001 goodwill was being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 20 years. Accumulated amortization was approximately
$12 million and $745 thousand at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets during the
first quarter of 2002 and, accordingly, has suspended amortization of goodwill.
See Note 2.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS - The Company measures impairment losses on long-lived assets,
including goodwill, when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might
be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. The Company measures
impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value
of the asset.
BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS INCOME PER SHARE - Basic and diluted net loss
income per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income loss by
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. There are
no potentially dilutive securities for the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000. Dilutive stock options for the year ended December 31, 2002 have not been
included in the calculation as their effect would be antidilutive due to the net
loss.
INCOME TAXES - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
liability method, as required by SFAS No. 109. Under the asset and liability
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS No. 109, the
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Provisions for taxes are made based upon the applicable tax laws of Mexico and
the United States. In conformity with SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not provided for differences related to assets and liabilities
that are remeasured from Pesos into U.S. dollars using historical exchange rates
and that result from inflation indexing for Mexican tax purposes or exchange
rate changes.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - For metal stamping and food products sales are recognized
at the time the order is shipped. For contract manufacturing sales are
recognized when the order is shipped for manufacturing contracts and over the
contract period for assembly services. Anticipated losses on assembly services
contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determined.
EMPLOYEE STATUTORY PROFIT-SHARING - A provision for deferred employee statutory
profit-sharing in Mexico is computed on income subject to employee statutory
profit-sharing, which differs from net income, due to certain differences in the
recognition of income and expenses for statutory profit-sharing and book
purposes. Employee statutory profit-sharing expense was approximately $0, $0 ,
and $17 thousand, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively.
POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS - Employees are entitled to certain benefits upon
retirement after 15 years or more of service seniority premiums, in accordance
with the Mexican Federal Labor Law. The benefits are accrued as a liability and
recognized as expense during the year in which services are rendered.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses,
notes payable, taxes payable, and amounts due to related parties, approximated
fair value as of December 31, 2002 because of the relatively short maturity of
these instruments. The fair values of floating rate long-term debt are estimated
to be equivalent to their carrying amount based on current market conditions.
ACCRUED REBATES - The Company enters into contractual agreements for rebates on
certain products with its customers. Such amounts are netted against sales and
included in accrued advertising and promotions based on management estimates at
the date the sales occur. PREPAID SLOTTING ALLOWANCES - Prepaid slotting allowances consist of payments to
customers for store shelf space
31 and distribution agreements and are amortized using the straight line method
over the term of the customer contract or proportionally with sales recorded,
based on the nature of the slotting contract. Contracts generally vary in length
from one to seven years and provide for fixed payments or payments upon
achievement of sales benchmarks. Prepaid slotting allowances of $16 million are
included on the balance sheet as other assets at December 31, 2002. There were
no prepaid slotting allowances at December 31, 2001.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations. This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an
asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which the associated
legal obligation for the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair
value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part
of the carrying amount of long-lived asset and amortized over the useful life of
the asset. The implementation of SAFS No. 143 for the year ended December 31,
2002 did not have a material impact on the Company financial statements.
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.
This statement requires, among other things, that gains and losses on the early
extinguishments of debt be classified as extraordinary only if they meet the
criteria for extraordinary treatment set forth in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 30. The provisions of this statement related to classification of
gains and losses on the early extinguishments of debt are effective for fiscal
years beginning after May 15, 2002. Implementation of this statement is not
expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements
of the Company.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities. It requires recording costs associated with
exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability has been
incurred. Under previous guidance, certain exit costs were accrued upon
management commitment to an exit plan, which is generally before an actual
liability has been incurred. The provisions of this Statement are effective for
exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The
Company does not believe this statement will have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation elaborates on the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The disclosure requirements of this interpretation are
effective for interim and annual periods after December 15, 2002. The initial
recognition and initial measurement requirements of this interpretation are
effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. The interpretation expanded disclosures will not have a material impact
on the Company financial position or results of operations. The Company does
not believe the adoption of the recognition and initial measurement requirements
of this interpretation will have a material impact on the financial position or
results of operations.
In December 2002 the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2002. The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and does not plan to change to
the fair value based method.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business
enterprises of variable interest entities. Under current practice, two
enterprises generally have been included in consolidated financial statements
because one enterprise controls the other through voting interests. This
interpretation defines the concept of variable interests and requires existing
unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary
beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risks among the
parties involved. This interpretation applies immediately to variable interest
entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in
which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first
fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable
interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it
acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company does not believe the adoption of
this interpretation will have a material impact on its financial position or
results of operations.
32 RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the 2001 financial statement presentation. 4. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS
On July 18, 2002, Elamex USA, Corp. Elamex USA, a wholly owned Delaware
subsidiary of Elamex, completed the acquisition of Mt. Franklin Holdings, LLC
Franklin, Franklin Food Products LLC and the merger of Reprop Corporation
with and into Elamex USA. The effective closing date for tax and accounting
purposes was the close of business on June 28, 2002. Franklin operates a retail
nut and foodservice nut packaging and marketing company, whose operations are
located in El Paso, Texas and a candy manufacturing and packaging facility in
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The purchase price was cash payment of US$1,445,040 and
923,161 restricted shares of the common stock of Elamex. 278,499 of these shares
are contingent and subject to escrow agreements, which requires Franklin to
reach certain income levels through December 31, 2003. The market value of the
shares at the transaction date was US$515 per share.
The unaudited proforma combined historical results, as if Franklin had been
acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2001, are estimated in the following table               IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA
December 31, 2002  December 31, 2001
Net sales          $  151,179     $  170,461

Net loss             11,090       23,120
Net loss per share         148        308 The above proforma results include adjustments to give effect to intercompany
sales, depreciation and other purchase price adjustments. The proforma results
are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred
had the acquisition been consummated as of the beginning of the periods
presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results.
On December 6, 2000, the Company sold its interest in Manufacturas del Noreste,
a subsidiary of the Company, to the subsidiary customer for approximately $195
thousand in cash and recognized a gain of approximately $100 thousand, which is
reflected in the 2000 results of operations.
On May 23, 2000, The Company completed the sale of its EMS operation. Under the
terms of the transaction, Elamex received approximately $512 million in cash,
subject to certain adjustments relating to the final determination of book
value. Elamex recognized a pre-tax gain on this sale of approximately $215
million, which is included in other income for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The EMS operation included two leased plants in Juarez, Mexico, and the lease
contracts for the buildings were transferred to the new owners as part of the
transaction. The EMS operation represented approximately $27 million in revenue
for the period January 1, through May 23, 2000, the date of the sale. 5. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
During the first quarter of 2001, the Company initiated a process of
restructuring its business model to eliminate non-productive assets and business
lines. As a result the Company recognized restructuring charges of $129 million
during the year ended December 31, 2001. Such restructuring charges include
severance and related costs and write-off of non-productive assets. As of
December 31, 2002 the Company has no accrued liabilities remaining in connection
with such restructuring charges.

1The variable rate notes for Precision are collateralized by bank
letter of credit in the amount of $122 million, expiring March 16, 2004. The
letter of credit, borrowings under the $10 million bank line of credit,
borrowings under the $15 million bank line of credit and the industrial revenue
building bonds are collateralized by substantially all the assets of Precision.
The debt agreements contain a number of affirmative and negative covenants,
including limitations on additional borrowings and maintenance of certain
financial ratios. The Company obtained waiver of compliance with certain of
these covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002. Also, the Bank
agreed to modify certain of these covenants as of
35 January 1, 2003. Management believes Precision will be in compliance with such
modified covenants through December 31, 2003, however there is no guarantee of
Precision continuing compliance.
2In connection with the long-term debt and line of credit, Franklin
is required to comply with certain financial covenants including minimum
tangible net worth. As of December 31, 2002 Franklin was not in compliance with
the minimum tangible net worth covenant. However, Franklin has received a waiver
from the bank for the period ended December 31, 2002 and continuing through
March 31, 2003. In addition, the bank has modified the existing covenants in
connection with the bank debt. The Company believes that Franklin will be able
to comply with the new covenants in the future, however there is no guarantee of
Franklin continuing compliance.
Prior to the acquisition of Franklin, Franklin entered into an interest rate
swap transaction in connection with long-term debt. The interest rate swap fixes
interest at 6% and expires in May 2003. At December 31, 2002 a liability of $44
thousand, the estimated fair value of the swap, has been recognized in
connection with this transaction.
9. LEASES
The Company utilizes certain machinery and equipment and occupies certain
buildings under both capital and operating lease arrangements that expire at
various dates through 2010, some of which have renewal options for additional
periods. Rental expense under these operating lease agreements aggregated $79
million, $25 million, and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001, and 2000, respectively.
Future minimum lease obligations at December 31, 2002 having an initial or
remaining term in excess of one year are as follows                                CAPITAL    OPERATING

The Company leases manufacturing facilities to unrelated parties under operating
lease agreements. The Company pays certain taxes on the properties and provides
for general maintenance. Included in property, plant and equipment at December
31, 2002 and 2001 is the cost of the land and buildings under operating lease
agreements of $78 million and $59 million and the related accumulated
depreciation of $33 million and $21 million, respectively.
Rental income was $882 thousand, $11 million, and $701 thousand for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The future minimum rental
income to be received under these operating leases is $750 thousand in 2003 and
$900 thousand in 2004.
10. INCOME TAXES
Mexican tax legislation requires that companies pay a tax calculated as the
greater of tax resulting from taxable income or tax on the value of certain
assets less certain liabilities asset tax. Taxes resulting from net income are
calculated using Mexican tax regulations, which define deductibility of expenses
and recognize certain effects of inflation.
Effective January 1, 1999, a new tax rate was enacted in Mexico whereby the
corporate tax rate is 35%. An amount equal to 32% is paid on taxable earnings
reinvested in the Company and 3% when those earnings are distributed in the form
of dividends for the year ended December 31, 1999. An amount equal to 30% is
paid on taxable earnings reinvested in the
36 Company and 5% on those earnings when they are distributed in the form of
dividends for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.
The new tax law enacted January 1, 2002 eliminated the option to defer the
payment of 5% of taxable income and reduces the 35% tax rate to 34% in 2003, 33%
in 2004 and 32% thereafter. The effect of this change on the Company financial
statements was recorded in 2002. The tax provision differs from the statutory tax rate of 35% on taxable income
as follows                                      2002    2001    2000

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future.
The valuation allowance of $48 and $59 million at December 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2001, respectively, relates primarily to certain asset tax and tax
net operating loss carryforwards of individual Mexican subsidiaries and net
losses of sale of stock in the Company EMS operation. The decrease in the
valuation allowance at December 31, 2002 to $48 million relates primarily to
the expiration of certain asset tax and tax net operating loss carryforwards of
individual Mexican subsidiaries.
The net asset taxes paid, adjusted for inflation, may be used to offset income
taxes that exceed the asset tax due for the year, for ten years following the
payment of the tax. These asset tax carryforwards as of December 31, 2002 are
$18 million and expire on various dates through 2012. At December 31, 2002, certain of the Mexican companies had tax net operating
loss carryforwards that can be utilized only by the Mexican company that
incurred the losses. These net operating loss carryforwards, adjusted for
inflation, expire as follows, if not utilized to offset taxable income             YEAR          AMOUNT

The majority stockholder has filed a consolidated tax return with Elamex
operations since 1995. The tax sharing agreement entered into between the
majority stockholder, Accel, S.A. de C.V., and Elamex through 1998 provided that
Elamex transfer monthly an amount equal to its estimated tax payment, less
credits. Beginning in 1999, the Mexican tax law for consolidation required
Elamex and its subsidiaries to pay amounts directly to the Mexican Tax Authority
SHCP based on their individual tax calculations. The payments are calculated
as required by the SHCP as if Elamex and subsidiaries were filing a stand-alone
income tax return for such year. The majority stockholder further agrees to
reimburse Elamex for use of any of Elamex tax benefits at the time Elamex
would otherwise realize the benefit.
Dividends paid by Mexican companies, which exceed earnings, and profits, as
defined by the Mexican income tax law, are subject to a 34% income tax, payable
by the Company on 15152 times the amount in excess of earnings and profits.
Dividends paid which do not exceed earnings and profits are not currently
subject to Mexican tax to either the Company or the stockholder. The Mexican
companies paid no dividends on common stock in 2002, 2001 and 2000.
11. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
COMMON STOCK - Under the bylaws and Mexican law, the capital stock of Elamex,
S.A. de C.V. must consist of fixed capital and may have, in addition thereto,
variable capital. Stockholders holding shares representing variable capital
common stock may require the Company, with a notice of at least three months
prior to December 31 of the prior year, to redeem those shares at a price equal
to the lesser of either i 95% of the market price, based on the average of
trading prices in the stock exchange where it is listed during the 30 trading
days preceding the end of the fiscal year in which the redemption is to become
effective or ii the book value of the Company shares as approved at the
meeting of stockholders for the latest fiscal year prior to the redemption date.
In July 2002, The Company issued 923,161 restricted shares of its authorized
variable capital common stock in connection with the acquisition of Mt. Franklin
Holdings see Note 4. Although the variable capital common stock is redeemable
by the terms described above, such shares would be classified as a component of
stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Management believes the
variable common stock represents permanent capital because the timing and
pricing mechanisms through which a stockholder would exercise this option to
redeem are such that a stockholder, from an economic standpoint, would not
exercise this option. At the time a stockholder is
38 required to give notice of redemption, the stockholder will not be able to know
at what price the shares would be redeemed and would not expect the present
value of the future redemption payment to equal or exceed the amount which would
be received by the stockholder in an immediate public sale.
Under Mexican law, dividends must be declared in Pesos. If dividends are
declared in the future, the Company intent is to pay the dividends to all
stockholders in U.S. dollars, as converted from Pesos as of the date of record,
unless otherwise instructed by the stockholder.
Mexican law requires that at least 5% of the Company net income each year
after profit sharing and other deductions required by the law be allocated to
a legal reserve fund, which is not thereafter available for distribution, except
as a stock dividend, until the amount of such fund equals 20% of the Company
historical capital stock. The legal reserve fund at December 31, 2002 and 2001
was approximately $16 million. The Company anticipates that no additional
allocation will be made at its annual stockholders' meeting to be held on April
24, 2003. Retained earnings available for dividends under Mexican law at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $174 million and $152 million respectively.
COMMON STOCK PURCHASE RESTRICTIONS AND PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS - Any person who seeks
to acquire ownership of 15% or more of the total outstanding shares of the
Company common stock must receive written consent from the Company Board of
Directors. Should shares in excess of 15% be acquired without permission, the
purchaser will be subject to liquidated damages, which will be used by the
Company to repurchase stock in excess of the 15% ownership limitation. In
addition, in the event that the Company issues additional shares, existing
stockholders will have a preemptive right to subscribe for new shares, except
when shares are issued in connection with a merger or for the conversion of
convertible debentures. The 15,000,000 shares of variable capital are not
subject to preemptive rights.
PREFERRED STOCK - Pursuant to the Company bylaws, the Company Board of
Directors, at its discretion, can issue up to an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares
of preferred stock in one or more series. The Board may attach any preferences,
rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions to the shares of each
series issued, including dividend rights and rates, conversion rights, voting
rights, terms of redemption, and liquidation preferences. The shares may be
issued at no par value or at a par value determined by the Board of Directors.
No shares of preferred stock have been issued as of December 31, 2002.
12. STOCK OPTION PLANS
On April 19, 2002, the shareholders approved the issuance of up to 850,000
Elamex stock options and authorized the Board of Directors to establish the
terms and conditions of the grant of the stock options.
On July 19, 2002, the Board of Directors of the Company granted 200,000 stock
options at $200 per share and 70,730 stock options at $600 per share.

17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is a party to various claims, actions, and complaints, the ultimate
disposition of which, in the opinion of management, will not have a material
adverse effect on the operations or financial position of the Company.
The Mexican Federal Labor Law requires a severance payment for all permanent
employees that are terminated by the employer. This payment is calculated on the
basis of 90-days' pay for termination anytime during the first year of
employment, with an additional 12 days pay for each year of service thereafter
up to two times minimum wage. While most
42 of the Company Mexican assembly labor is hired under temporary labor contracts
during the first two months of employment, the labor force is changed to
permanent labor contracts after this period. The Company has agreements with
many of its contract-assembly customers, which require that the customers pay
the severance costs incurred, in the event that assembly contracts are
terminated prior to their scheduled completion. In management opinion, any
severance costs incurred upon the termination of any manufacturing contracts
would not be material.
Seniority premiums to which employees are entitled upon retirement after 15
years or more of service, in accordance with the Mexican Federal Labor Law, are
recognized as expense during the year in which services are rendered, based on
actuarial computations. Included in other liabilities is approximately $51
thousand and $25 thousand as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which
fully accrues for these estimated seniority obligations.
Qualcore, the joint venture with GE, entered into a 12-year lease agreement
beginning January 2001 for the building that it occupies in Celaya Mexico. The
monthly lease payments are approximately $94,628 and are guaranteed by both
Elamex and GE. Qualcore also obtained bank financing from Wells Fargo and
Eximbank for the plastic molding and metal stamping equipment for the Celaya
plant. The original notes payable totaled $84 million with a five-year term and
have equal semi-annual principal payments of $840 thousand plus interest. The
loan facilities are guaranteed by both GE and Elamex.
At December 31, 2002, one of the Company subsidiaries was committed to
approximately $760 thousand in future expenditures for machinery and equipment.
One of the Company subsidiaries has entered into certain fixed-price
commitments to purchase raw materials to be used in its manufacturing process
over the next year. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate value of these
commitments was approximately $216 million.
The Company is a defendant in a preferential payment transfer action in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Mexico. The Trustee for
the Bankruptcy Estate of Furr Supermarkets, Inc Furr alleges that the
Company has received preferential payments by Furr prior to the Furr
bankruptcy filing of $194 thousand and is seeking repayment from the Company for
the alleged transfer. Although the amount of liability that may result from this
matter cannot currently be ascertained, the Company does not believe that the
action will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of
operations or cash flow. 18. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
In accordance with the SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets the
Company is required to do an annual impairment test, the Company is in the
