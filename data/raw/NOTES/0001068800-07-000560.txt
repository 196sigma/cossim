ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cenveo, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cenveo,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity
deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule included in a2. These financial statements and schedule
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Cenveo, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Notes 1, 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, and No.
158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
132R.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of
Cenveo, Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION. Cenveo, Inc. and subsidiaries collectively,
the Company or Cenveo are engaged in the printing and manufacturing of
envelopes, business forms and labels and commercial printing. The Company
is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, is organized under Colorado law,
and its common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol CVO.
The Company reporting periods for 2006, 2005 and 2004 in this report
consist of 52, 52, and 53-week periods, respectively, ending on the Saturday
closest to the last day of the calendar month and ended on December 30, 2006,
December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2005, respectively. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements are presented as ending on December 31,
since the effect of reporting periods not ending on that date are not
material.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cenveo,
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have
been eliminated. On March 31, 2006, the Company sold to Supremex Income
Fund, a new open-ended trust formed under the laws of the Province of
Quebec the Fund, all of the shares of Supremex Inc. Supremex, a
Canadian subsidiary of the Company, and certain other assets of the
envelope, forms and labels segment. Beginning in the fourth quarter of
2006, the financial results of Supremex and the other assets sold have been
accounted for as a discontinued operation resulting in the Company
historical consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash
flows being reclassified to reflect such discontinued operations separately
from continuing operations Notes 3, 13, 15 and 20.
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates
and assumptions are used for, but not limited to, establishing the
allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, depreciation and
amortization lives, asset impairment evaluations, tax assets and
liabilities, self-insurance accruals and other contingencies. Actual
results could differ from estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on
deposit and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates fair value.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced
amounts. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, accounts receivable were reduced
by an allowance for doubtful accounts of $48 million and $52 million,
respectively.
INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market,
with cost determined on a first-in, first-out or average cost basis. Cost
includes materials, labor and overhead related to the purchase and
production of inventories. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, inventory was
reduced by an allowance for obsolescence of $49 million and $59 million,
respectively.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment are
stated at cost. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the
related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Expenditures for
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, and
expenditures that increase the capacity, efficiency or useful lives of
existing assets are capitalized.
31            CENVEO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method based on the
estimated useful lives of 15 to 45 years for buildings and building
improvements, 10 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and three to 10
years for furniture and fixtures.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE. The Company develops and purchases software for
internal use. Software development costs incurred during the application
development stage are capitalized. Once the software has been installed and
tested and is ready for use, additional costs incurred in connection with
the software are expensed as incurred. Capitalized computer software costs
are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, usually
between three and seven years. Net computer software costs included in
property, plant and equipment were $79 million and $101 million as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. Direct expenses such as legal, accounting and
underwriting fees incurred to issue or extend debt, are included in other
assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Debt issuance costs were
$84 million and $130 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized over the
term of the related debt as interest expense. In June of 2006, the Company
refinanced certain of its long-term debt and wrote off approximately $66
million of debt issuance costs associated with the debt retired and
capitalized $38 million of costs related to the Company new debt Note
9. Interest expense includes $17 million, $36 million and $46 million
of debt issuance costs amortized in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Goodwill represents the excess
of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses
acquired. Goodwill is reviewed annually in the fourth quarter to determine
if there is impairment, or more frequently if an indication of possible
impairment exists. No impairment charges for goodwill or other intangible
assets were recorded in 2006, 2005 or 2004.
Other intangible assets primarily arise from the purchase price
allocations of businesses acquired and are based on independent appraisals
or internal estimates. Intangible assets with determinable lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life assigned
to these assets. Intangible assets that are expected to generate cash flows
indefinitely are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment similar to
goodwill.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Long-lived assets, including property, plant and
equipment, and intangible assets with determinable lives, are evaluated for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. An impairment is
assessed if the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an
asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are recognized
for the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair
value. The estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets are periodically
reviewed and revised if necessary.
SELF-INSURANCE. The Company is self-insured for the majority of its
workers' compensation costs and group health insurance costs, subject to
specific retention levels. The Company records its liability for workers'
compensation claims on a fully-developed basis. The Company liability for
health insurance claims includes an estimate for claims incurred but not
reported.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and
collection is reasonably assured.
Since a significant portion of the Company products are customer
specific, it is common for customers to inspect the quality of the product
at the Company facility prior to its shipment. Products shipped are not
subject to contractual right of return provisions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The Company has rebate agreements with certain customers. These rebates
are recorded as reductions of sales and are accrued using sales data and
rebate percentages specific to each customer agreement. Accrued customer
rebates are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets Note 8.
FREIGHT COSTS. The costs of delivering finished goods to customers are
recorded as freight costs and included in cost of sales. Freight costs that
are included in the price of the product are included in net sales.
ADVERTISING COSTS. All advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising costs were $26 million, $40 million and $52 million in 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than
the U.S. dollar are translated at year-end exchange rates. The effects of
translation are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income in shareholders' equity deficit in the consolidated balance sheet.
Income and expense items are translated at the average monthly rate.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in income.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company
adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment SFAS 123R, which revised SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. As a result, the Company now
measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of
grant rather than its intrinsic value, the method the Company previously
used see Note 12.
INCOME TAXES. Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax effect of
temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities
for financial and income tax reporting and are measured by applying
statutory tax rates in effect for the year during which the differences are
expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
assets will not be realized see Note 10.
In addition, the Company policy is to establish tax contingency
liabilities for potential tax issues. The tax contingency liabilities are
based on our estimate of the probable amount of additional taxes that may
be due in the future. Any additional taxes due would be determined only
upon completion of current and future federal, state and international tax
audits. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had $126 million and
$95 million, respectively, of tax contingency liabilities included in
other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, SFAS
154. SFAS 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20,
Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements and changes the requirements for the accounting for
and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 applies to all
voluntary changes in accounting principles and to changes required by an
accounting pronouncement in the unusual case when specific transition
provisions are not provided by the accounting pronouncement. SFAS 154
requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements
for a change in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to
determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of
the change. Under SFAS 154, a change in the method of applying an
accounting principle would also be considered a change in accounting
principle. The adoption of SFAS 154 did not have any immediate effect on
its

consolidated financial position or results of operations, except for the
adoption of SFAS 123R, which provides specific transition provisions.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans--An Amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS 158 Note 13.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 FIN 48,
which was effective for the Company on January 1, 2007. FIN 48 was issued
to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact of this interpretation.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value and establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS 157
is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2008. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact SFAS 157 will have on its
consolidated financial statements.
2. ACQUISITIONS
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting;
accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses have
been recorded at estimated fair value at the date acquired with the excess
of the purchase price over the estimated fair value recorded as goodwill
Note 20.
On July 12, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the
common stock of Rx Label Technology Corporation, with annual sales of
approximately $35 million. This new subsidiary of the Company operates
under the name Rx Technology Corporation Rx Technology. Rx Technology
specializes in providing pharmacies with labels used to dispense
prescription drugs to consumers. The aggregate purchase price paid for Rx
Technology by the Company was approximately $494 million, which included
$06 million of fees and expenses. The fair values of property, plant and
equipment and other intangible assets were determined in accordance with
independent appraisals. The Rx Technology acquisition has preliminarily
resulted in $291 million of goodwill, of which approximately $89 million
is deductible for income tax purposes. The other identifiable intangible
assets determined by the independent appraisal were $129 million of
customer relationships which is being amortized over their estimated
weighted average useful life of 19 years and $06 million of patent
technology which is being amortized over six years Note 7. Rx
Technology operations are included within the Company envelopes, forms
and labels segment results.
In May 2005, the Company purchased the assets of Digidel, Inc., a
provider of pre-press services to commercial printing companies in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with annual sales of approximately $30 million.
The purchase price was $46 million $36 million paid in 2005 and $10
million paid in 2006 of which $07 million was allocated to tangible net
assets, $03 million to intangible assets and $36 million to goodwill. The
Company consolidated this operation with its commercial printing plant in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
In July 2004, the Company purchased the stock of Valco Graphics Inc., a
commercial printing company in Seattle, Washington with annual sales of
approximately $180 million. The purchase price was $96 million with $51
million allocated to tangible net assets and $45 million allocated to
goodwill.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED
Valco Graphics Inc. was consolidated with the Company existing commercial
printing plant in Seattle, Washington.
In August 2004, the Company purchased the assets of WWP Property
Management, Inc., a commercial printing company in San Francisco,
California with annual sales of approximately $140 million. The purchase
price was $28 million $14 million paid in each of 2004 and 2005 with
$27 million allocated to tangible net assets and $01 million allocated to
goodwill. The Company has consolidated this operation with its existing
commercial printing plant in San Francisco, California and is operating the
combined entity as Cenveo, San Francisco.
The results of the acquired businesses have been included in the
Company consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates. Pro
forma results for 2006 and 2005, assuming the acquisitions had been made at
the beginning of the applicable period, have not been presented since they
would not be materially different from the Company reported results.
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Supremex
On March 31, 2006, the Company sold to the Fund all of the shares of
Supremex, which operated the Company Canadian envelope operations, and
certain other assets. At closing, the Company received cash proceeds of
approximately $1194 million, net of transaction expenses and subject to
the finalization of a working capital adjustment, and approximately 114
million units of the Fund representing a 365% economic and voting
interest in the Fund. The March 31, 2006 sale resulted in a pre-tax gain
of approximately $1241 million in the first quarter of 2006, after the
allocation of $558 million of goodwill to the business as required by SFAS
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In addition, after closing, in
April 2006 the Company received approximately 1 $714 million of proceeds
relating to the March 31, 2006 sale and recorded a pre-tax gain of
approximately $14 million as a result of the Canadian dollar strengthening
against the U.S. dollar, and 2 $207 million from the sale of 25 million
units in the Fund relating to an over-allotment option to the underwriters
and recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $93 million, which reduced
the Company economic and voting interest in the Fund to 286%. The
Company used a significant portion of the above proceeds received to repay
amounts outstanding under its senior secured credit facility on March 31,
2006 and to repay another credit facility in April 2006.
In December 2006, the Company decided to sell its remaining units in
the Fund prior to the end of the first quarter of 2007 and determined it
would not have any significant influence over its investment after the
planned sale Note 20. Accordingly, the operating revenues and expenses of
these assets through March 31, 2006 have been classified as discontinued
operations under SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, for all periods presented, beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2006. Discontinued operations also includes equity income of
$62 million related to the Company retained investment in the Fund after
the March 31, 2006 sale through December 31, 2006. From April 2006 through
December 2006, the Company received $62 million of distributions from the
Fund. As a result of the finalization of the working capital adjustment in
December 2006, the Company recorded an additional pre-tax gain on the sale
of $35 million and a reduction to the gain on sale of $27 million as a
result of finalization of 2005 tax returns. As of December 31, 2006, the
Company investment in the Fund was $462 million, which is classified in
assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet.
In 2006, the operating results of the discontinued operations are for
the period from January 1, 2006 to March 31, 2006, the date of the sale,
and includes equity income from April 1, 2006 through

4. OTHER DIVESTITURES
During 2006, the Company sold three small non-strategic commercial
printing businesses in Somerville, Massachusetts, Bloomfield Hills,
Michigan and Memphis, Tennessee for net proceeds of $32 million and
recorded losses on sale of non-strategic businesses of $20 million.
During 2005, the Company sold six small non-strategic businesses,
including a fine papers business in Ontario, Canada, a mailing supplies
business in Dekalb, Illinois, printing operations in Riviera Beach,

On June 23, 2006, the Company completed a tender offer and consent

Notes due 2012 and extinguished approximately $3395 million in aggregate
principal amount approximately 97% of the outstanding amount that were
tendered and accepted for purchase under the terms of the Tender Offer. The
Company may redeem the remaining outstanding 9 5/8% Senior Notes, in whole
or in part, on or after March 15, 2007, at redemption prices from 1048% to
100%, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
On June 21, 2006, the Company entered into a credit agreement that
provides for $525 million of senior secured credit facilities with a
syndicate of lenders the Credit Facilities. The Credit Facilities
consist of a $200 million six-year revolving credit facility Revolving
Credit Facility and a $325 million seven-year term loan facility Term
Loan. The Credit Facilities contain customary financial covenants,
including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a
minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. Borrowing rates under the
Credit Facilities are determined at the Company option at the time of
each borrowing and are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR
or the prime rate publicly announced from time to time, in each case plus a
specified interest rate margin see Interest rate swaps. The Credit
Facilities are secured by substantially all of the Company assets.
Proceeds from the Credit Facilities and other available cash were used to
fund the Tender Offer, to retire the Company existing Senior Secured
Credit Facility due 2008 which had no amounts outstanding, and for $38
million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized over the
maturities of the Credit Facilities.
In connection with the debt refinancing in June 2006, the Company
incurred a $327 million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to
the Tender Offer and the retirement of the Senior Secured Credit Facility,
which consisted of Tender Offer premiums of $252 million, the write-off of
previously unamortized deferred financing costs of $66 million and Tender
Offer expenses of $09 million.
In January 2004, the Company issued $320 million of 7 7/8% senior
subordinated notes due 2013 Senior Subordinated Notes. The interest on
these notes is payable semi-annually. The Company may redeem these notes,
in whole or in part, on or after December 1, 2008, at redemption prices
from 1039% to 100%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The net proceeds
from the sale of the Senior Subordinated Notes were used to fund the tender
offer and redemption of the Company 8 3/4% senior subordinated note which
were due to mature in 2008. The loss recorded on the early extinguishment

the 8 3/4% senior subordinated notes consisted of redemption premiums of
$135 million and unamortized debt issuance costs of $42 million. The debt
issuance costs for the Senior Subordinated Notes of $72 million are being
amortized over the term of the notes.
The interest rate on other long-term debt was 86% and 81% at December
31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Cash interest payments on long-term debt were $680 million in 2006 689 million in 2005 and $674 million in 2004.
The estimated fair value of the Company long-term debt was $6659
million and $8284 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The Credit Facilities contain certain restrictions that, among other
things and with certain exceptions, limit the ability of the Company to
incur additional indebtedness, prepay subordinated debt, transfer assets
outside of the Company, pay dividends or repurchase shares of common stock.
The Company is also required to comply with maximum consolidated leverage
ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio financial covenants
pertaining to the Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2006, the Company
was in compliance with all debt agreements.
Interest rate swaps
During June 2006, the Company entered into interest rate swap
agreements to hedge interest rate exposure for $220 million notional amount
of floating rate debt. This hedge of interest rate risk was designated and
documented at inception as a cash flow hedge and is evaluated for
effectiveness at least quarterly. Effectiveness of this hedge is calculated
by comparing the fair value of the derivative to a hypothetical derivative
that would be a perfect hedge of floating rate debt. There was no
ineffectiveness from this hedge through December 31, 2006. At December 31,
2006, the Company has recorded a liability of $28 million, which
represents the decrease in the current fair value of floating rate cash
inflows that are less than the fixed cash outflows over the remaining term
of the hedges. The decrease of cash inflows largely reflects the decrease
in LIBOR as of December 31, 2006, as compared to LIBOR at the time that the
Company entered into the swap agreements. The liability is included in
other liabilities and the offsetting amount is included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2006. The accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in
the fair value of cash flow hedges and the effect on the Company
consolidated financial statements will depend on whether the hedge is
highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of cash

Guarantees
In conjunction with the sale of the prime label business in 2002, the
Company guarantees a lease obligation assumed by the buyer of this
business. The guarantee requires the lessor to pursue collection and other
remedies against the buyer before demanding payment from the Company. The
remaining payments under the lease term, which expires in April 2008, are
approximately $35 million. If the Company were required to honor its
obligation under the guarantee, any loss would be reduced by the amount
generated from the liquidation of the equipment.

Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in
the financial statements. The tax effects of these temporary differences are
recorded as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax
assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
in future years. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have
been deducted for tax purposes, but have not yet been recorded in the
consolidated statements of operations. Valuation allowances are recorded to
reduce deferred tax assets when it is not more likely than not that a tax
benefit will be realized. The tax effects of temporary differences that give
rise to the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of the Company at
December 31, are as follows in thousands                                   2006      2005

2025, foreign tax credit carryforwards of $167 million will expire in 2012

million do not have an expiration date.
The Company assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and, to
the extent recoverability does not satisfy the more likely than not
recognition criteria under SFAS 109, records a valuation allowance against its
deferred tax assets. The Company considered its recent operating results and
anticipated 2007 taxable income in assessing the need for its valuation
allowance. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company adjusted
its valuation allowance to reflect the realizability of deferred tax assets.
In 2006, the Company decreased its valuation allowance by approximately $594
million, primarily as a result of utilizing its net operating loss
carryforwards, principally against the gain on sale of Supremex and certain
other assets, which is reflected in discontinued operations Note 3.
During 2005, due to insufficient positive evidence substantiating
recoverability, the Company increased its valuation allowance against its
net U.S. deferred tax assets by $871 million, which included $71 million
relating to the tax benefit from stock-based compensation. This resulted
from management determining that it would no longer implement prior
identified tax planning strategies.
During 2004, the Company increased its valuation allowance by $203
million. This increase resulted from the Company belief that it would not
be able to realize certain U.S. deferred tax assets through the reversal of
taxable temporary differences and the execution of available tax planning
strategies given the net operating losses from its U.S. operations.
The remaining portion of the Company valuation allowance as of December
31, 2006 will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to
conclude that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax
assets will be realized. When sufficient positive evidence exists, the
Company income tax expense will be reduced by the decrease in its valuation
allowance. An increase or reversal of the Company valuation allowance could
have a significant negative or positive impact on the Company future
earnings. Any reversal of the valuation allowance related to stock-based
compensation will be reflected as paid-in capital and will not affect the
Company future effective income tax rate.
The Company establishes tax contingency liabilities for potential tax
issues, which are based on estimates of whether it is probable additional
taxes will be due in the future. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company had tax contingency liabilities of $126 million and $95 million,
respectively, which were included in other liabilities on its consolidated
balance sheets. During 2004, the Internal Revenue Service IRS completed
the examination of the Company tax years 1996 through 2002. The outcome
of the tax audit resulted in the issuance of a no change letter by the
IRS. As a result, the Company determined that tax contingency liabilities
reserves of $64 million were no longer necessary and released these
reserves in 2004.
Net cash payments for income taxes were $27 million in 2006, $15
million in 2005 and $43 million in 2004.

12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan the Plan provides for
the grant of stock options, restricted shares and stock appreciation rights
of the Company common stock and restricted share units RSUs based on
the Company common stock to certain officers, other key employees,
non-employee directors and consultants.
The Company outstanding nonvested stock options have maximum
contractual terms of up to ten years, principally vest ratably over four
years and were granted at exercise prices equal to the market price of the
Company common stock on the date of grant. The Company outstanding
stock options are exercisable into shares of the Company common stock.
The Company outstanding restricted shares vest ratably over four years.
The Company has no outstanding stock appreciation rights. The Company
outstanding restricted share units principally vest ratably over four
years. Upon vesting, the restricted share units are convertible into shares
of the Company common stock.
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R. As a
result, the Company now measures the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of equity instruments, including grants of employee
stock options, restricted stock and restricted share units, based on the
fair value of the award at the date of grant rather than its intrinsic
value, the method the Company previously used. The Company is using the
modified prospective application method under SFAS 123R and has elected
not to use the retrospective application method. Thus, amortization of the
fair value of all nonvested grants as of January 1, 2006, as determined
under the previous pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS 123, except as
adjusted for estimated forfeitures, is included in the Company results of
operations commencing January 1, 2006, and prior periods have not been
restated. As required under SFAS 123R, the Company has reversed the
unearned compensation component of shareholders' equity deficit with an
equal offsetting reduction of paid-in capital as of January 1, 2006 and is
now increasing paid-in capital for share-based compensation costs
recognized during the period. Additionally, effective with the adoption of
SFAS 123R, the Company recognizes share-based compensation expense net of
estimated forfeitures, rather than as forfeitures occur as presented under
the previous pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 subsequently set
forth in this footnote. Employee stock compensation grants or grants
modified, repurchased or cancelled on or after January 1, 2006 are valued
in accordance with SFAS 123R. Under SFAS 123R, the Company has chosen
1 the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model the Black-Scholes
Model for purposes of determining the fair value of stock options granted
commencing January 1, 2006 and 2 to continue recognizing compensation
costs ratably over the requisite service period for each separately vesting
portion of the award.
Total share-based compensation expense recognized in selling, general
and administrative expenses in the Company consolidated statements of
operations was $60 million, $25 million and $07 million in 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. Total share-based compensation expense recognized
in restructuring, impairment and other charges in the Company
consolidated statements of operations was $27 million in 2005.
As a result of adopting SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, the Company
income from continuing operations before income taxes and net income in
2006 was $33 million lower than if it had continued to account for share
based compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 APB 25.
Basic and diluted income per share in 2006 was $006 lower than if the
Company had to account for share-based compensation under APB 25. Net cash
used in operating and financing activities in 2006 were the same if the
Company had continued to account for share based compensation under APB 25.
As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $291 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation grants, which is expected to be amortized over a
weighted-average period of 22 years.

Under the Plan, the change in the Company board of directors on
September 12, 2005, triggered the change of control provision of the Plan.
Accordingly, all outstanding stock options and restricted stock vested on
September 12, 2005. The amount of stock-based compensation expense
reflected in the pro forma calculation of net loss per share for 2005 is
primarily the result of the acceleration in the vesting of the outstanding
stock options and restricted stock.
The Black-Scholes Model has limitations on its effectiveness including
that it was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable and
that the model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions including
expected stock price volatility. The Company stock option awards to
employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimates.
In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP, No.
123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of
Share-Based Payment Awards. FSP No. 123R-3 provides an elective
alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at
the beginning balance of the paid-in capital pool related to employee
compensation and a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on
the paid-in capital pool of employee awards that are fully vested and
outstanding upon the adoption of SFAS 123R. This election is not available
for adoption until January 1, 2007. The Company has determined not to use
the alternative method.
13. RETIREMENT PLANS
SAVINGS PLAN. The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan to
provide substantially all U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees an
opportunity to accumulate personal funds for their retirement. In 2006, the
Company only matched certain union employee voluntary contributions. In
2005 and 2004, the Company matched a certain percentage of each employee
voluntary contribution. All contributions made by the Company were made in
cash and allocated pro-rata to the funds selected by the employee. Company
contributions to the plan were approximately $04 million in 2006

and $60 million in 2005 and 2004. The plan held 2,192,289 shares of the
Company common stock at December 31, 2006.
PENSION PLANS. The Company currently maintains pension plans for
certain of its employees in the U.S. under collective bargaining agreements
with unions representing these employees. The Company expects to continue
to fund these plans based on governmental requirements, amounts deductible
for income tax purposes and as needed to ensure that plan assets are
sufficient to satisfy plan liabilities.
SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS. As a result of an acquisition
in 2000, the Company assumed responsibility for a supplemental executive
retirement plan SERP, which provide benefits to certain former
directors and executives. For accounting purposes, these plans are
unfunded; however, the predecessor company had purchased annuities, which
are included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets. These
annuities cover a portion of the liability to the participants in these
plans and the income from the annuities offsets a portion of the cost of
the plans.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158. This standard requires an
employer to: i recognize in its statement of financial position an asset
for a plan overfunded status or a liability for a plan underfunded
status; ii measure a plan assets and its obligations that determine its
funded status as of the end of the employer fiscal year with limited
exceptions; and iii recognize changes in the funded status of a defined
benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. These
changes will be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the
Company, the requirement to recognize the funded status of its benefit plans
and the disclosure requirements are effective as of December 31, 2006 and
are detailed below. The Company current measurement date is the date of
its fiscal year end; therefore, the measurement date requirement under SFAS
158 will have no impact on the Company. Beginning in 2007, the Company will
recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the change
occurs through accumulated other comprehensive income on its consolidated
balance sheet.
The effect of applying SFAS 158 on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2006, was                             BEFORE                    AFTER

obligations at December 31, 2006, was based on the Hewitt Yield Curve
HYC, with the result rounded to the nearest 025%. The HYC was designed
by Hewitt Associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the
obligations of their pension plans or postretirement benefit plans. The HYC
is a hypothetical double A yield curve represented by a series of
annualized individual discount rates. Each bond issue underlying the HYC is
required to have a rating of Aa or better by Moody Investor Service, Inc.
or a rating AA or better by Standard & Poor. The discount rate
assumptions for the pension expenses in 2006 and the obligations at
December 31, 2006 and 2005 were also based on the HYC.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 80% is based
on historical returns and the expectations for future returns for each
asset class in which plan assets are invested as well as the target asset
allocation of the investments of the plan assets. The asset allocations and

loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
options to issue common stock were exercised. The only Company securities
as of December 31, 2006 that could dilute basic income per share for
periods subsequent to December 31, 2006 are 1 outstanding stock options
which are exercisable into 3,326,780 shares of the Company common stock

Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act as of
December 31, 2006. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were sufficiently effective and designed to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by us in our filings under the
Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.
61 MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15f of the Exchange Act. The Company internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the
Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of the Company financial statements for external
reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.
Management has conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
this assessment, management has determined that the Company internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 is effective.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of
assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Management assessment of the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited
by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report appearing on page 63.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS
Our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our
internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
system objectives will be met. Our disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. The
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of
simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls
is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods
are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with
policies or procedures.
62      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cenveo, Inc.
We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that
Cenveo, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Cenveo,
Inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
of the company internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that Cenveo, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
criteria. Also, in our opinion, Cenveo, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated
balance sheets of Cenveo, Inc. as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders'
equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006 and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.
