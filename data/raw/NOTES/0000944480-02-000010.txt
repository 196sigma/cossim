NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999
1. Business and liquidity
GSE Systems, Inc. GSE Systems, GSE or the Company develops and
delivers business and technology solutions by applying process control,
simulation software, systems and services to the energy, process and
manufacturing industries worldwide. The Company solutions and services assist
customers in improving quality, safety and throughput; reducing operating
expenses; and enhancing overall productivity.
The Company operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
including, among others, rapid technological changes, success of the Company
product development, marketing and distribution strategies, the need to manage
growth, the need to retain key personnel and protect intellectual property, and
the availability of additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company. 2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Revenue recognition
Revenue under fixed-price contracts generally is accounted for on the
percentage-of-completion method, based on contract costs incurred to date and
estimated costs to complete. Estimated contract earnings are reviewed and
revised periodically as the work progresses, and the cumulative effect of any
change is recognized in the period in which the change is identified. Estimated
losses are charged against earnings in the period such losses are identified.
The effect of changes in estimates of contract earnings was to increase gross
profit by approximately $353,000 during the year ended December 31, 1999. Such
changes were not material during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001.
Revenues from certain consulting or training contracts are recognized on a
time-and-material basis. For time-and-material type contracts, revenue is
recognized based on hours incurred at a contracted labor rate plus expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average
cost method, or market. Slow moving inventory is reflected at its estimated net
realizable value. Inventory costs include raw materials and purchased parts.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method with estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the
estimated useful life, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method.
Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related amortization are eliminated from
the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Software development costs
Certain computer software development costs are capitalized in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Capitalization of computer software
development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility.
Capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the
software product is commercially available for general release to customers.
Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in
cost of revenue and is provided using the straight-line method over the
remaining estimated economic life of the product, not to exceed five years.
Research and development
Development expenditures incurred to meet customer specifications under
contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method are charged to
contract costs. Company sponsored research and development expenditures are
charged to operations as incurred and are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses. The amounts incurred for Company sponsored research and
development activities relating to the development of new products and services
or the improvement of existing products and services, exclusive of amounts
capitalized, were approximately $827,000, $1,679,000, and $2,915,000, for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.
Asset impairment
The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived
assets by comparing the carrying value of the asset to management best
estimate of the expected future cash flows to be generated by the asset,
undiscounted and without interest costs. Impairments are recognized in operating
results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value. No impairment
losses were recognized in 2001, 2000, or 1999.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price for acquired businesses
over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. These
amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from seven
to fifteen years. The Company assesses the recovery of goodwill by determining
whether amortization of goodwill over its remaining life can be recovered
through undiscounted cash flows of the acquired operations. Goodwill impairment,
if any, is measured by determining the amount by which the carrying value of
goodwill exceeds its fair value based upon discounting of future cash flows.
Foreign currency translation
Balance sheet accounts for foreign operations are translated at the
exchange rate at the balance sheet date, and income statement accounts are
translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss in stockholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses, resulting from
changes in exchange rates, are included in other income expense in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which they occur. For the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, foreign currency transaction
gains were approximately $253,000, $55,000, and $40,000, respectively.
Warranties
As the Company recognizes revenue under the percentage-of-completion
method, it provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on
historical and projected claims experience.
Income taxes
Deferred income taxes are provided under the asset and liability method.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Provision is made
for the Company current liability for federal, state and foreign income taxes
and the change in the Company deferred income tax assets and liabilities. No
provision has been made for the undistributed earnings of the Company foreign
subsidiaries as they are considered permanently invested. Amounts of
undistributed earnings are not material to the overall consolidated financial
statements.
Earnings loss per share
Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number
of outstanding common shares for the period. Diluted earnings per share adjusts
such weighted average for the potential dilution that could occur if stock
options, warrants or other convertible securities were exercised or converted
into common stock. Diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per
share for the year ended December 31, 2000 because the effects of such items
were anti-dilutive. The net income for 2001 was decreased by preferred stock
dividends of $17,000 in calculating the per share amounts.   The number of common shares and common share equivalents used in the
determination of basic and diluted earnings loss per share was as follows             
Years ended December 31,
2001      2000      1999
Weighted average shares outstanding - Basic          5,217,453   5,181,972    5,065,688
Weighted average shares outstanding - Diluted         5,259,016   5,181,972    5,351,474
Concentration of credit risk
The Company is subject to concentration of credit risk with respect to
contract receivables. Credit risk on contract receivables is mitigated by the
nature of the Company worldwide customer base and its credit policies. The
Company customers are not concentrated in any specific geographic region, but
are concentrated in the energy and manufacturing industries. For the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, one customer accounted for approximately 17 22% and 13%, respectively, of the Company revenues. At December 31, 2001, the
contracts receivable balance related to this significant customer was
approximately $12 million, or 104% of contract receivables, of which all was
unbilled at year-end. In 2001 and 2000, another customer accounted for
approximately 24%, and 11%, respectively, of the Company revenues. At December
31, 2001, the contracts receivable balance related to this significant customer
was approximately $16 million, or 138% of the balance, of which $484,000 was
unbilled at year-end.
Fair values of financial instruments
The carrying amounts of current assets, current liabilities, and
long-term debt reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair
value.
Off balance sheet risk and foreign exchange contracts
The Company utilizes various derivative financial instruments to manage
market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. It is the Company policy to use derivative financial instruments to
protect against market risk arising in the normal course of business. The
criteria the Company uses for designating an instrument as a hedge include the
instrument effectiveness in risk reduction and one-to-one matching of
derivative instruments to underlying transactions. The Company monitors its
foreign currency exposures to maximize the overall effectiveness of its foreign
currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the Euro and the
Japanese yen. The Company objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize
the risks using the most effective methods to reduce the impact of these
exposures. The Company minimizes credit exposure by limiting counterparties to
nationally recognized financial institutions.
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138 which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments. The adoption of Statement No.
133 resulted in no cumulative adjustment to income or other comprehensive income
at January 1, 2001. All derivatives, whether designated as hedging relationships
or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the
derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of
the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge,
the change in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item are
recognized as an element of other comprehensive income. The Company utilizes
forward exchange contracts, options and swaps, as defined by Statement No. 133,
to hedge certain foreign currency balance sheet exposures.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had contracts for the sale of
approximately $866,000 and $52,000 of Japanese Yen and Euros, respectively, at
fixed rates. The contracts expire on various dates through November 2002. The
Company has not designated the contracts as hedges and accordingly has recorded
the estimated fair value of the contracts of $95,000 at December 31, 2001 as
other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and other income expense in the
consolidated statement of operations. Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform
with the current year presentation.
New Accounting Standards
On July 20, 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, Business
Combinations, and Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Statement 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the
purchase method. Statement 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to
earnings, but instead be reviewed for impairment at least annually. The
amortization of goodwill ceases upon adoption of the Statement, which for the
Company will be January 1, 2002.
In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The provisions of this statement
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company
does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the
Company consolidated financial statements. 3. Investment in Avantium International B.V.
On February 24, 2000, the Company licensed certain of its simulation
software products to Avantium International B.V. Avantium in exchange for
251,501 shares of Avantium preferred stock, valued at $25 million, and 352,102
shares of Avantium common stock, valued at $349,000. The software license, which
is perpetual in nature, gives Avantium the right to use the software in the
development of new software products. Each share of preferred stock is
convertible into common stock.
Avantium was formed to develop high-speed experimentation and simulation
HSE technologies for application in new product and process development in
pharmaceutical, petrochemical, fine chemical, biotechnology and polymers
industries. Avantium expects to develop HSE technologies through in-house
development and contract research at leading universities, hardware developers
and informatics companies. Avantium has various investors, including Shell
International Chemical, SmithKline Beecham, W.R. Grace, Akzo Nobel, three major
European universities and various venture capital firms.   During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recognized
software-licensing revenue of $29 million based on the fair value of the
consideration received from Avantium. The fair value was established based on
cash paid by other investors for their respective preferred and common stock
interests in Avantium. The Company has delivered all elements of the software
and has no other obligations to Avantium, other than standard warranty. The
Company accounted for its investment in Avantium using the cost method of
accounting based on management conclusion that the Company did not have
significant influence with respect to the operations of Avantium. During the
year ended December 31, 2000, the Company also received an additional $29
million contract from Avantium to make certain improvements and enhancements to
the software on a best efforts basis. The rates and margins in the contract were
comparable to those the Company earns performing services for its other
customers.
As a result of the experience with Avantium in 2000, the Company concluded
that a combination of the relevant interests of the two companies would
significantly increase the potential of both organizations. In addition,
focusing the technical and marketing resources of Avantium and the GSE
VirtualPlant team would produce significant cost savings. Accordingly, on March
6, 2001, the Company sold its VirtualPlant business to Avantium. Avantium
purchased certain fixed assets and intellectual property including BatchCAD and
BatchWizard software products, obtained perpetual licenses to certain GSE
Process software products, and employed certain personnel in both the U.S. and
the UK. GSE received 200,000 shares of Avantium preferred stock and 280,000
shares of Avantium common stock, which increased its equity interest in Avantium
to approximately 19% and the carrying value of its investment to $75 million.
The Company recognized a gain on the sale of its VirtualPlant business of $33
million, before income taxes. This gain was determined based on the estimated
fair value of the Avantium stock received, based on an independent appraisal,
net of the book value of the assets sold and the estimated costs to settle
severance with employees terminated from GSE and other transaction expenses.
Although the Company retained one seat on the supervisory board of Avantium,
management concluded that such seat did not provide the Company with significant
influence. Accordingly, the Company continued to account for its investment in
Avantium using the cost method. The cost method requires that if a decline in
fair value below cost is judged by management to be other than temporary, the
cost basis must be written down to fair value as a new cost basis, and the
amount of the write-down is included in earnings as a realized loss. Any new
cost basis derived in this manner is not changed for subsequent recoveries in
fair value.
On February 7, 2002, Avantium completed a private placement round of
financing which resulted in 20 million Euros in new capital and the conversion
of 11 million Euros of convertible debt. The equity issuance and debt conversion
diluted GSE ownership in Avantium to 61%. The estimated fair market value of
Avantium following the financing was $474 million. Accordingly, the Company
concluded that this transaction was evidence of an other than temporary
decline in the fair value of its investment in Avantium. Thus, in the fourth
quarter 2001, the Company wrote down its investment in Avantium to $29 million
and recognized a $46 million pre-tax charge. 4. Contract receivables

Line of Credit
The Company has a $100 million bank line of credit under which the
Company and its subsidiaries, GSE Process Solutions, Inc. and GSE Power Systems,
Inc., are jointly and severally liable as co-borrowers. The credit facility
provides for borrowings to support working capital needs and foreign letters of
credit $20 million sublimit. The line is collateralized by substantially all
of the Company assets and provides for borrowings up to 85% of eligible
accounts receivable, 50% of eligible unbilled receivables and 40% of eligible
inventory up to a maximum of $12 million. GP Strategies Corporation, one of
the Company major stockholders, has provided a limited guarantee totaling $18
million. The interest rate on this line of credit is based on the bank prime
rate plus 075% 550% as of December 31, 2001, with interest only payments due
monthly. At December 31, 2001, the Company available borrowing base was
approximately $58 million, of which approximately $50 million had been
utilized. The credit facility expires on March 23, 2003.
The credit facility requires the Company to comply with certain financial
ratios and precludes the Company from paying dividends and making acquisitions
beyond certain limits without the bank consent. At December 31, 2001, the
Company was in compliance with the covenants. Notes Payable to Related Parties
In 2000, the Company issued a demand promissory note to ManTech that
allowed the Company to borrow up to $18 million at an interest rate of prime
plus one percent. In addition, ManTech provided $18 million in standby letters
of credit to the Company bank as additional collateral for the Company
credit facility. In April 2001, ManTech agreed to allow the Company bank to
draw upon ManTech $18 million letter of credit which supported the Company
credit facility, thus paying down a portion of the Company bank debt in
exchange for additional subordinated debt in the Company. Accordingly, the
Company promissory note to ManTech was amended to increase the amount to $39
million. The amended note permitted ManTech to convert the principle amount of
the note into GSE Series A convertible preferred stock at a conversion rate of
$100 per share. The Company determined that the conversion of this debt did not
constitute a beneficial conversion.   ManTech elected to convert its subordinated debt into equity on December
5, 2001. The Series A convertible preferred stock has no voting rights and bears
dividends at the rate of 6% per annum payable quarterly. Dividends will
accumulate if not paid quarterly and compounded interest will accrue on any
unpaid dividends. ManTech at its discretion has the right to convert each share
of Series A convertible preferred stock into GSE common stock at a purchase
price of $2645 per share at any time after a one-year holding period from the
date of issuance. At the end of the third year from the date of issuance, the
Series A convertible preferred stock automatically converts into GSE common
stock. Prior to ManTech conversion of the Series A convertible stock to common
stock, GP Strategies has the option to acquire 50% of the Series A convertible
preferred stock for $1,950,000 from ManTech.   On June 25, 2001, the Company issued an additional unsecured promissory
note to ManTech for $10 million at an interest rate of prime plus one percent.
The Company used the loan proceeds for working capital purposes. The note is
subordinated to the Company credit facility. In January 2002, the Company
repaid ManTech $250,000, plus $36,000 of interest and expects to pay the balance
of the loan before the end of the second quarter 2002. Obligations under financing leases   During 1999, 2000, and 2001 the Company entered into five separate
contracts with a customer for the lease of certain hardware and software under
36-month leases. The Company has accounted for the leases as sales-type leases.
The Company assigned the payments due under the sales-type leases to a
third-party financing company and received proceeds of $2,198,000 in 2001 and
$1,141,000 in 2000. Since the Company remains contingently liable for amounts
due to the third-party financing company, the remaining investment in and
obligation under the financing leases are reflected in the Company balance
sheets as follows

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
statements. A summary of the tax effect of the significant components of the
deferred income tax assets liabilities is as follows

At December 31, 2001, the Company had available $13,456,000 and $2,384,000
of domestic and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, which
expire between 2012 and 2020. In addition, the Company had $379,000 of foreign
tax credit carryforwards, which expire between 2003 and 2005. These
carryforwards will be utilized to reduce taxable income in subsequent years.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future income in
making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income
generated by the Company Process and Power business units and projections of
future taxable income in fiscal 2002 and 2003, management has established a
valuation allowance of $4,930,000 and $5,350,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. During 2001, the Company decreased its valuation allowance by
$420,000. During 2000, the Company increased its valuation allowance by $43
million. 12. Capital stock   At a special shareholder meeting on August 2, 2001, the Company
shareholders approved an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
increasing GSE authorized common stock by eight million shares. As of December
31, 2001, the Company had 20,000,000 total shares of capital stock authorized,
of which 18,000,000 are designated as common stock and 2,000,000 are designated
as preferred stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to establish one or
more classes of preferred stock and to determine, within any class of preferred
stock, the preferences, rights and other terms of such class.
On March 6, 2001, with the completion of the sale of VirtualPlant to
Avantium see Note 3, the Company granted warrants to purchase shares of the
Company common stock to two non-employees. The warrants provide the right to
purchase 37,500 shares of the Company common stock at $100 per share. In
2001, the Company recognized expense related to the warrants of $115,000.
On March 9, 2001, with the completion of the sale of VirtualPlant to
Avantium see Note 3, the Company arranged a consulting agreement with a
terminated employee. In consideration of consulting services, the Company
granted fully vested options to purchase 53,000 shares of the Company common
stock at $170 per share. In 2001, the Company recognized expense related to
these options based on their estimated fair value of $79,000.
As of December 21, 2001, the Company completed a rights offering granting
rights to shareholders to purchase additional shares of common stock for a
subscription price of $253 per share. The rights granted 0711 for every share
of common stock held of record as of October 26, 2001. Each whole right entitled
the shareholder to purchase one share of common stock for $253 per share. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company had a rights offering receivable of $13 million
due from its escrow agent and accrued $139,000 of costs associated with the
completion of the rights offering. The Company received the cash proceeds from
its escrow agent in January 2002. The proceeds were used for a partial repayment
of a $1 million loan from ManTech and working capital requirements.
In 1998, in connection with the Company then existing credit facility,
the Company had arranged for certain guarantees to be provided on its behalf by
GP Strategies and ManTech. In consideration for these guarantees, the Company
granted each of ManTech and GP Strategies warrants to purchase shares of the
Company common stock; each of such warrants provides the right to purchase
150,000 shares of the Company common stock at $2375 per share. In 1998, the
Company recorded $300,000 as the estimated fair value of such warrants and
amortized such value over the life of the initial guarantee, which expired in
June 1999. During 1999, the Company recognized expense related to these warrants
of $120,000.
As of December 31, 2001, the Company has reserved 3,732,635 shares of
common stock for issuance upon exercise of stock options and warrants and the
conversion of preferred stock.
13. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
On December 5, 2001, ManTech elected to convert $39 million of
subordinated debt into Series A convertible preferred stock at a conversion rate
of $100 per share. The Company has determined that the conversion of this debt
into preferred stock did not constitute a beneficial conversion. The Series A
convertible preferred stock has no voting rights and bears dividends at the rate
of 6% per annum payable quarterly. Dividends will accumulate if not paid
quarterly and compounded interest will accrue on any unpaid dividends. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company had accrued dividends payable of $17,000.
In the event of liquidation or dissolution of the Company, payment of
available funds shall be made on the Series A convertible preferred stock
including payment in satisfaction of dividend obligations prior and in
preference to the common stock. ManTech at its discretion has the right to
convert each share of Series A convertible preferred stock into GSE common stock
at a purchase price of $2645 per share at any time after a one-year holding
period from the date of issuance. At the end of the third year from the date of
issuance, the Series A convertible preferred stock automatically converts into
1,474,480 shares of GSE common stock. Prior to ManTech conversion of the
Series A convertible stock to common stock, GP Strategies has the option to
acquire 50% of the Series A convertible preferred stock for $1,950,000. 14. Stock options

The Company accounts for grants under the Plan in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense
has been recognized for options granted to employees and directors as these
options have been granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. Had compensation expense been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under the Plan
consistent with the fair value method of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation, the Company pro forma net loss, and basic and diluted
loss per common share would have been approximately $972,000 and $19,
respectively, in 2001; $111 million and $214, respectively, in 2000; $615,000
and $12, respectively, in 1999.
The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and
1999: expected volatility of 110%, 110%, and 82%; dividend yield of 0 risk-free interest rates ranging from 36% to 62%; and expected terms ranging
from 1 to 7 years. The weighted-average fair value of options granted during
2001, 2000, and 1999 was $155 per share, $393 per share, $282 per share,
respectively. 15. Commitments and contingencies

Various actions and proceedings are presently pending to which the Company
is a party. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liabilities, if any,
arising from such actions are not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. 16. Other related party transactions
In January 2000, the Company issued 116,959 shares of its common stock to
ManTech for $500,000. The proceeds of the stock issuance were used for working
capital.   Due to the Company liquidity situation at the end of 2000, GSE
experienced some difficulties in procuring supplies from its vendors for
business operations. In January 2001, the Company entered into a purchasing
arrangement with ManTech whereby ManTech dealt directly with some of the
Company vendors, ordered the supplies needed and had the products shipped in
accordance with the Company instructions. Purchases under this agreement
totaled $843,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. This purchasing
arrangement terminated in June 2001, and the Company has no outstanding
obligations to ManTech, in connection with this purchasing arrangement as of
December 31, 2001. The supplies purchased through ManTech were at the same
prices at which the Company could have procured the supplies directly.
In September 2001, the Company entered into a sublease agreement with
ManTech, allowing ManTech to sublease 2,088 square feet of space at the
Company Columbia, Maryland office through September, 2002. For the year ended
December 31, 2001, such sublease rentals amounted to $13,000.
In September, 2001, the Company entered into an alliance with General
Physics Corporation, the leading supplier of operator instructional training
programs for the Power industry. In addition to cooperating in marketing of
individual products, the companies will combine some of General Physics'
extensive training materials and programs with GSE power plant simulation
models to provide interactive and adaptive total training solutions. GSE will
also help sell and distribute General Physics' GFE product to GSE customer
base.
On December 7, 2001, the Company agreed to make certain cash and in-kind
contributions to RedStorm Scientific, LLC RedStorm in exchange for a 10%
membership interest in RedStorm. RedStorm is a privately held computational drug
design company. Its technology patents pending, known as Fyrestar, utilizes
bio-informatics and computer-aided molecular design to create lead compounds
that are developed into successful new drugs. It greatly reduces the significant
cost associated with screening thousands of potential compounds common in the
drug development process.
The Company paid $50,000 to RedStorm in the fourth quarter of 2001 and will
make additional cash payments of $50,000 in each of the first three quarters of
2002. GSE in-kind contribution consists of the development of a graphical user
interface that will allow scientists to easily access and use the Fyrestar
technology and the development of additional functionality to Fyrestar, allowing
results to be graphically displayed as the calculations take place. This will
allow scientists the opportunity to adjust their assumptions in real time, and
further improve results. GSE will receive a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free,
non-transferable exclusive license for RedStorm software products solely in
the power and process control markets.
GSE will receive one seat on RedStorm Board of Managers. Additionally,
two of the Company directors are also on RedStorm Board of Managers. The
Company will account for its investment in RedStorm using the equity method of
accounting based on management conclusion that the Company has significant
influence with respect to the operations of RedStorm. 17. Employee benefits
The Company has a qualified defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all U.S. employees under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue
Code. Under this plan, the Company stipulated basic contribution matches a
portion of the participants' contributions based upon a defined schedule.
Contributions are invested by an independent investment company in one or more
of several investment alternatives. The choice of investment alternatives is at
the election of each participating employee. The Company contributions to the
plan were approximately $293,000, $340,000, and $359,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. 18. Acquisitions and dispositions
Acquisitions
In April 1999, the Company completed two acquisitions for the Process
business unit which were accounted for using the purchase method. The Company
purchased certain assets and employed the associates of BatchCAD Limited, a
United Kingdom-based supplier of batch process development and design consulting
services and simulation software tools. The purchase price was approximately
$548,000 payable in cash in three equal installments on January 1, 2000, 2001
and 2002 and was allocated as follows in thousands  
Purchased software property and equipment           $ 481

intelligence software. The purchase price was $350,000 and was allocated 100% to
property and equipment as purchased software.
In December 1997, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common
stock of J.L. Ryan, Inc. Ryan for an initial purchase price of $1,000,000
and contingent consideration based on the performance of the business from 1998
to 2002. A minimum of $250,000 of such earnings payments for each of 1998 and
1999 was guaranteed by the Company. The Company paid $600,000 in cash upon the
closing of the transaction and entered into a promissory note payable in four
annual installments of $100,000 each beginning on January 2, 1999. This
acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. For the years ended
December 31, 2000, and 1999, the contingent consideration in excess of the
minimum guaranteed amount was approximately $549,000 and $411,000, respectively,
which the Company has recorded as additions to goodwill. For the year ended
December 31, 2001, there was no contingent consideration.
Dispositions   On November 30, 2000, the Company completed the sale of its GSE Process
Solutions N.V. subsidiary GSE Belgium to Newton Beheer B.V., pursuant to a
stock purchase agreement, whereby Newton Beheer B.V. acquired all of the assets
and assumed all of the liabilities of GSE Belgium. The aggregate cash sales for
GSE Belgium was $1. The Company recognized a loss before income taxes on this
