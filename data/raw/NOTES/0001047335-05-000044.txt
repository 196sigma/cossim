Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of National HealthCare Corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National HealthCare Corporation and
its subsidiaries NHC or the Company. All material intercompany balances, profits, and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation, and minority interests are reflected in consolidation. Investments in
entities in which we lack control but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies are accounted for on the equity method. Investments in entities in which we lack the ability
to exercise significant influence are included in the consolidated financial statements at the lower of the cost
or fair value of our investment. Generally, we operate, manage or provide services to long-term health care centers and associated
assisted living centers, retirement centers and home health care programs located in Southeastern,
Midwestern and Western states in the United States. The long-term health care environment has continually
undergone changes with regard to Federal and state reimbursement programs and other payor sources,
compliance regulations, competition among other health care providers and patient care litigation issues.
We continually monitor these industry developments as well as other factors that affect our business. 
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Net Patient Revenues Gross patient revenues are recorded on an accrual basis based on services rendered at amounts equal
to our established rates. Approximately 72% of our net patient revenues in 2004 and 71% in 2003 and 2002
are from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Our patient revenues are derived primarily from skilled, intermediate and rehabilitative nursing
services offered in long-term health care centers or in a patient home. In some locations, we offer
associated retirement center services and/or assisted living center services. Our goal is to offer a continuum
of care, with patients passing from a retirement center or home care to assisted living or long-term nursing
center care as their needs change. We receive payments from the Medicare program under a prospective payment system PPS.
Under this PPS, for long-term care services. Medicare pays a fixed fee per Medicare patient per day, based
on the acuity level of the patient, to cover all post-hospital extended care routine service costs, ancillary costs
and capital related costs. Amounts received from Medicaid programs are generally based on fixed rates
subject to program cost ceilings. For homecare services, Medicare pays based on the acuity level of the patient and based on episodes
of care. An episode of care is defined as a length of care up to 60 days with multiple continuous episodes
allowed. The services covered by the episode payment include all disciplines of care, in addition to medical
supplies, within the scope of the home health benefit. Our providers are allowed to make a request for
anticipated payment at the start of care equal to 60% of the expected payment for the initial episode. The
remaining balance due is paid following the submission of the final claim at the end of the episode.
Revenues are recognized when services are provided based on the number of days of service rendered in the
episode. Deferred revenue is recorded for payments received for which the related services have not yet been
provided. Allowances for contractual adjustments are recorded for the differences between our established
rates and amounts paid by the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other third party payors. Contractual
adjustments are deducted from gross patient revenues to determine net patient revenues.  All amounts earned under the Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs are subject to
review by the payors. In the opinion of management, adequate provision and reserves have been made for
any adjustments that may result from such reviews, including reviews related to the transition of payments
to the PPS amounts. Any differences between estimated settlements and final determinations are reflected
in operations in the year finalized. NHC recorded $24,225,000 in 2004, $2,683,000 in 2003 and $4,010,000
in 2002 of net favorable settlements from Medicare and Medicaid for periods prior to the beginning of fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  With respect to our long-term health care centers, for the cost report years 1997 and 1998 which
were subject to a retrospective reimbursement methodology, we submitted various requests for exceptions
to Medicare routine cost limitations for reimbursement. During 2001, we received preliminary approval on
substantially all of our exception requests, which approvals total approximately $14,186,000. We have in
addition made provisions of approximately $12,761,000 for various Medicare and Medicaid issues for
current and prior years. We recognize revenues associated with the approved exception requests and
provisions when the approvals are assured and the results of final cost report audits are known. These
approvals and audit results are subject to further audit and review by the fiscal intermediaries for a three-year
period. As such, the approved requests and cost report provisions have been included in amounts due to third
party payors, which are payables to Medicare and Medicaid intermediaries, in the consolidated balance
sheets. The three-year review period expired in 2004 for approximately $22,820,000 of routine cost limit
exceptions and provisions. Therefore, these exceptions and provisions have been eliminated from the
amounts due to third party payors in the consolidated balance sheets, and have been recorded as revenues
in 2004. The amounts recorded during 2003 and 2002 were not significant. 
Other Revenues As discussed in Note 5, other revenues include revenues from the provision of insurance,
management and accounting services to other long-term care providers, guarantee fees, advisory fees from
National Health Investors, Inc. NHI and National Health Realty, Inc. NHR, dividends and other
realized gains on marketable securities, equity in earnings of unconsolidated investments, interest income,
rental income, loss on disposal of assets and other income. We charge for management and accounting
services based on a percentage of net revenues or based on a fixed fee per bed of the long-term care center
under contract. Advisory fees are based on our contractual agreements with NHR and, through October 31,
2004 NHI, and are discussed in Notes 2 and 3. We generally record other revenues on the accrual basis
based on the terms of our contractual arrangements. However, with respect to management and accounting
services revenue and interest income from certain long-term care providers, including National Health
Corporation National and NHI, as discussed in Note 5, where collectibility is uncertain or subject to
subordination to other expenditures of the long-term care provider, we recognize the revenues and interest
income when the amounts are collected. 
Provision for Doubtful Accounts The Company allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated using current agings of accounts
receivable, historical collections data and other factors. Management reviews these factors and determines
the estimated provision for doubtful accounts. Historical bad debts have generally resulted from
uncollectible private balances, some uncollectible coinsurance and deductibles and other factors.
Receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible are written off. The allowance for doubtful accounts balance
is assessed on a quarterly basis, with changes in estimated losses being recorded in the consolidated
statements of operations in the period identified.  The Company includes provisions for doubtful accounts in operating expenses in its consolidated
statements of operations. The provisions for doubtful accounts were $2,175,000, $55,000 and $3,650,000
for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Property and Equipment We use the straight-line method of depreciation over the expected useful lives of property and
equipment estimated as follows: buildings and improvements, 20-40 years and equipment and furniture, 3-15 years. The provision for depreciation includes the amortization of properties under capital leases. Leasehold improvements attached to properties owned by NHI and NHR are depreciated over the
non-cancelable respective lease terms using the straight-line method. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged against income as incurred. Betterments are
capitalized. We remove the costs and related allowances from the accounts for properties sold or retired,
and any resulting gains or losses are included in income. We include interest costs incurred during
construction periods in the cost of buildings $240,000 in 2004, $162,000 in 2003, and $40,000 in 2002. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144, we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying
values of our properties on a property by property basis. We review our properties for recoverability when
events or circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant adverse changes
in general economic conditions, and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property,
indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize an
impairment is based on estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that
property. If recognition of an impairment is necessary, it is measured as the amount by which the carrying
amount of the property exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
Mortgage and Other Notes Receivable In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan - An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 15 SFAS 114, NHC
evaluates the carrying values of its mortgage and other notes receivable on an instrument by instrument basis.
On a quarterly basis, NHC reviews its notes receivable for recoverability when events or circumstances,
including the non-receipt of principal and interest payments, significant deteriorations of the financial
condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the
carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, an impairment is measured as
the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be received under
the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable.
Investments in Marketable Securities Our investments in marketable securities include available for sale securities, which are recorded
at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded in stockholders' equity
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS 115. 
Goodwill Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS 142 required that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not
amortized but are subject to impairment tests based on their estimated fair value. The adoption of SFAS 142
effective January 1, 2002 resulted in the cessation of goodwill amortization of approximately $247,000 per
year. Unamortized goodwill is continually reviewed for impairment in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 142.
Other Assets Deferred financing costs are amortized principally by the effective interest method over the terms
of the related debt obligations. 
Income Taxes We utilize Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax laws that will be in
effect when the differences are expected to reverse. See Note 11 for further discussion of our accounting
for income taxes.
Concentration of Credit Risks Our credit risks primarily relate to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash held by trustees,
accounts receivable, marketable securities and notes receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily
held in bank accounts and overnight investments. Restricted cash is primarily invested in commercial paper
and certificates of deposit with financial institutions and other interest bearing accounts. Accounts
receivable consist primarily of amounts due from patients funded approximately 87% through Medicare,
Medicaid, and other contractual programs and approximately 13% through private payors and from other
health care companies for management, accounting and other services. We perform continual credit
evaluations of our clients and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts on these accounts receivable.
Marketable securities are held primarily in accounts with brokerage institutions. Notes receivable relate
primarily to secured loans with health care facilities recorded as notes receivable in the consolidated balance
sheets and to secured notes receivable from officers, directors and supervisory employees recorded as
reductions in stockholder equity in the consolidated balance sheets as discussed in Notes 9 and 12. We
also have notes receivable from NHR as discussed in Note 2 and from National and the National Health
Corporation Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP as discussed in Note 4. Our financial instruments, principally our notes receivable, are subject to the possibility of loss of
the carrying values as a result of either the failure of other parties to perform according to their contractual
obligations or changes in market prices which may make the instruments less valuable. We obtain various
collateral and other protective rights, and continually monitor these rights in order to reduce such
possibilities of loss. We evaluate the need to provide reserves for potential losses on our financial
instruments based on management periodic review of the portfolio on an instrument by instrument basis.
See Notes 2, 4, 9 and 12 for additional information on the notes receivable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three
months.
Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily represents cash that is held by trustees and cash that is held for the purpose
of our workers' compensation insurance, professional liability insurance, and a loan repurchase obligation.
Inventories Inventories consist generally of food and supplies and are valued at the lower of cost or market, with
cost determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities primarily represents accruals for current federal and state income taxes, real
estate taxes, debt service rent and other current liabilities.
Accrued Risk Reserves We are principally self-insured for risks related to employee health insurance, workers'
compensation and professional and general liability claims. Accrued risk reserves primarily represent the
accrual for self-insured risks associated with employee health insurance, workers' compensation and
professional and general liability claims. The accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims
and estimates for incurred but unreported claims. Our policy with respect to a significant portion of our
workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to support the
estimates recorded for incurred but unreported claims. Our health insurance reserve is based on our known
claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis of historical
claims paid. We reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis, with changes in estimated losses
being recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period identified.
Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation arrangements under the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related
interpretations. We have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, as amended. As a result,
no compensation cost has been recognized in the consolidated statements of income for NHC stock option
plan.  Had compensation cost for our stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the
grant date of awards consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123, our net income and earnings per share
would have been as follows dollars in thousands, except per share amounts

Deferred Lease Credit-- Deferred lease credits include amounts being amortized to properly reflect expenses on a straight
line basis under the terms of our existing lease agreements. 
Other Noncurrent Liabilities Other noncurrent liabilities include reserves related to various income tax and other contingencies. With respect to guarantee obligations in place prior to January 1, 2003, we account for our
obligations under guarantee agreements in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Accounting
Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies SFAS 5. For guarantee obligations assumed
subsequent to January 1, 2003, consistent with the provisions of Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others FIN 45, at the inception of guarantee agreement, we recognize a liability for the estimated fair
value of the obligation assumed.  We account for our contingent liabilities for income tax matters in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS 5. Contingent liabilities for income tax matters include amounts for income taxes and interest
thereon and are the result of the potential alternative interpretations of tax laws and the judgmental nature
of the timing of recognition of taxable income. 
Deferred Revenue-- Deferred revenue includes the deferred gain on the sale of assets to National as discussed in Note
4, certain amounts related to episodic payments received by our home health care providers in advance of
providing services as discussed in Note 1 and entrance fees that have been and are currently being received
upon reservation and occupancy of retirement center units for a continuing care retirement community we
own. In accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Audit and Accounting
Guide, Health Care Organizations, the entrance fees have been recorded as deferred revenue. The
refundable portion 90% of the entrance fees is being recognized over the life of the facility while the non-refundable portion 10% is being recognized over the remaining life expectancies of the residents. 
Comprehensive Income-- Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income requires
that changes in the amounts of certain items, including gains and losses on certain securities, be shown in
the consolidated financial statements as comprehensive income. We report our comprehensive income in
the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.
Segment Disclosures Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report
information about operating segments in annual and interim financial reports issued to stockholders.
Management believes that substantially all of our operations are part of the long-term health care industry
segment. Our operations outside of the long-term health care industry segment are not material. See Note
5 for a detail of other revenues provided within the long-term health care industry segment. Information
about the costs and expenses associated with each of the components of other revenues is not separately
identifiable. 
Prior Year Reclassifications Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45. FIN 45 requires that the guarantor recognize, at the
inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such
guarantees. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosure requirements about the guarantor obligations under
certain guarantees that it has issued. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this
interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. As discussed in Notes 9 and 13, in connection with a loan purchase obligation agreement executed
in 2003, we have recognized a liability of $5,124,000 based on the provisions of FIN 45 and the estimated
fair value of our obligation under this guarantee.  In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
FIN 46, which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities by the primary beneficiary of such
variable interest entities.  NHC has adopted FIN 46 effective March 31, 2004. The Company is not the
primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity and, therefore, has not consolidated any additional entities
as the result of adoption of FIN 46. The Company guarantees $10,389,000 of annual lease payments
through 2007 of 13 individual entities that operate 13 long-term health care facilities in Florida. The 13
individual entities, which lease the facilities from NHI and NHR, are each variable interest entities. The
Company has also extended a working capital loan outstanding balance of $1,145,000 at September 30,
2004 and has a 50% equity interest in a hospice company formed in 2003, which hospice company is also
a variable interest entity. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of any of these variable interest
entities. The Company maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these variable interest
entities is the guaranteed lease payments through 2007 and the outstanding balance of the working capital
loan to the hospice company. On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.  Statement 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting
for Nonmonetary Transactions, that was issued in 1973. The amendments made by Statement 153 are based
on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the
assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of
similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that
do not have commercial substance. Previously, Opinion 29 required that the accounting for an exchange
of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive
asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished. The provisions in Statement 153 are
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005, and as
such, the Company is unable to assess the impact on the financial statements.  The FASB has issued FASB Statement No. 123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment. The new
FASB rule requires the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in
financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments
issued. The scope of Statement 123R includes a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements
including share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and
employee share purchase plans. Statement 123R replaces FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Statement 123, as originally issued in 1995, established as preferable a fair-value-based method of
accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. Statement 123R is applicable as of the
first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005.  
Note 2 - Relationship with National Health Realty, Inc. In 1997, we formed NHR as a wholly-owned subsidiary. We then transferred to NHR certain
healthcare facilities then owned by NHC and distributed the shares of NHR to NHC shareholders. The
distribution had the effect of separating NHC and NHR into two independent public companies. As a result
of the distribution, all of the outstanding shares of NHR were distributed to the then NHC investors. NHR
is listed on the American Stock Exchange. 
Leases On December 31, 1997, concurrent with our conveyance of certain assets to NHR, we leased from
NHR the real property of 16 long-term health care centers, six assisted living facilities and one retirement
center. Each lease is for an initial term expiring December 31, 2007, with two additional five year renewal
terms at our option, assuming no defaults. We account for the leases as operating leases. During the initial term and each renewal term, we are obligated to pay NHR annual base rent on all
23 facilities of $15,405,000. In addition to base rent, in each year after 1999, we must pay percentage rent
to NHR equal to 3% of the increase in the gross revenues of each facility. The percentage rent is based on
a quarterly calculation of revenue increases and is payable on a quarterly basis. Percentage rent for 2004,
2003, and 2002 was approximately $1,295,000, $1,128,000, and $805,000, respectively. Each lease with
NHR is a triple net lease under which we are responsible for paying all taxes, utilities, insurance premium
costs, repairs and other charges relating to the ownership of the facilities. We are obligated at our expense
to maintain adequate insurance on the facilities' assets. We have a right of first refusal with NHR to purchase any of the properties transferred from us
should NHR receive an offer from an unrelated party during the term of the lease or up to 180 days after
termination of the related lease. On October 1, 2000, we terminated our individual leases on nine Florida health care facilities owned
by NHR. However, we remain obligated under our master lease agreement with NHR and continue to
remain obligated to make the lease payments to NHR. Subsequently, the facilities were leased by NHR for
a five year term to nine separate corporations, none of which we own or control. Lease payments received
by NHR from the new lessees offset our lease obligations pursuant to the master operating lease. Through
December 31, 2004, all such lease payments have been received by NHR and offset against our obligations. At December 31, 2004, the approximate future minimum base rent commitments to be paid by us
on non-cancelable operating leases with NHR are as follows Total Commitments Including

Thereafter   Advisory Agreement-- We have entered into an Advisory Agreement with NHR whereby we provide to NHR services
related to investment activities and day-to-day management and operations. With respect to advisory
services provided to NHR, we are subject to the supervision of and policies established by NHR Board of
Directors. Either party may terminate the NHR Advisory Agreement on 90 days notice at any time. Our
executive management officers serve in the same executive positions for NHR. For our services under the NHR Advisory Agreement, we are entitled to annual compensation of the
greater of 2% of NHR gross consolidated revenues or the actual expenses we incurred. During 2004,
2003, and 2002, our compensation under the NHR Advisory Agreement was $411,000, $467,000, and
$493,000, respectively. Pursuant to the NHR Advisory Agreement, NHR has agreed that as long as we are obligated on both
the NHR Advisory Agreement and a similar Advisory Agreement with NHI, NHR would only do business
with us and not compete with NHI. We are no longer obligated on the agreement with NHI and this
restriction is no longer in place. However, NHR is limited in its capacity to grow due to limited capital
resources. 
Note Receivable from NHR In December 2003, in order to increase our return on previously uninvested cash, we loaned
approximately $14,924,000 to NHR. NHR used the proceeds of the loan to exercise its right to repurchase
certain first mortgage notes receivable which had previously been sold to NHI. While outstanding, the note
from NHR required monthly interest payments at the 30 day LIBOR plus 225% or at 4%, whichever was
greater. The entire promissory note was repaid in February 2004.  
Investment in NHR Common Stock At December 31, 2004, we own 345,200 shares or 36% of NHR outstanding common stock. We
account for our investment in NHR common stock as available for sale marketable securities in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 115. 
Note 3 - Relationship with National Health Investors, Inc. In 1991, we formed NHI as a wholly-owned subsidiary. We then transferred to NHI certain
healthcare facilities owned by NHC and distributed the shares of NHI to NHC shareholders. The
distribution had the effect of separating NHC and NHI into two independent public companies. As a result
of the distribution, all of the outstanding shares of NHI were distributed to the then NHC investors. NHI is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Leases On October 17, 1991, concurrent with our conveyance of real property to NHI, we leased from NHI
the real property of 40 long-term health care centers and three retirement centers. Each lease is for an initial
term expiring December 31, 2001, with two additional five-year renewal terms at our option, assuming no
defaults. During 2000, we exercised our option to extend the lease term for the first five-year renewal term
under the same terms and conditions as the initial term. We account for the leases as operating leases. During the initial term and first renewal term of the leases, we are obligated to pay NHI annual base
rent on all 43 facilities of $19,355,000 as adjusted for new construction since inception. If we exercise our
option to extend the leases for the second renewal term, the base rent will be the then fair rental value as
negotiated with NHI. The leases also obligate us to pay as debt service rent all payments of interest and principal due
under each mortgage to which the conveyance of the facilities was subject. The payments are required over
the remaining life of the mortgages as of the conveyance date, but only during the term of the lease.
Payments for debt service rent are being treated by us as payments of principal and interest if we remain
obligated on the debt obligated debt service rent and as operating expense payments if we have been
relieved of the debt obligation by the lender non-obligated debt service rent. See Accounting Treatment
of the Transfer for further discussion. In addition to base rent and debt service rent, we must pay percentage rent to NHI equal to 3% of
the increase in the gross revenues of each facility. The percentage rent is based on a quarterly calculation
of revenue increases and is payable on a quarterly basis. Percentage rent for 2004, 2003, and 2002 was
approximately $4,124,000, $3,708,000, and $3,695,000, respectively. Each lease with NHI is a triple net lease under which we are responsible for paying all taxes,
utilities, insurance premium costs, repairs and other charges relating to the ownership of the facilities. We
are obligated at our expense to maintain adequate insurance on the facilities' assets. We have a right of first refusal with NHI to purchase any of the properties transferred from us should
NHI receive an offer from an unrelated party during the term of the lease or up to 180 days after termination
of the related lease. As the result of a fire in a building leased from NHI by one of our limited liability company
subsidiaries, the lease was terminated during the third quarter of 2004. A provision of the lease allowed that
if substantial damage occurred during the lease term, we could terminate the lease with respect to the
damaged property. Under the lease, NHC will have no obligation to repair the property and NHI will receive
the entire insurance proceeds related to the building damage. We are obligated to continue to indemnify and
hold harmless NHI from any and all demands arising from our use of the property. NHI retains the right to
license the beds under the lease termination. On October 1, 2000, we terminated our individual leases with NHI on four Florida long-term health
care facilities. However, we remain obligated to NHI under our master lease agreement and continue to
remain obligated to make the lease payments to NHI. Subsequently, the facilities were immediately leased
by NHI for a five year term to four separate corporations, none of which we own or control. Lease payments
received by NHI from the new lessees offset our lease obligations pursuant to the master operating lease.
Through December 31, 2004, all such lease payments have been received by NHI and offset against our
obligations. Base rent expense to NHI was $19,355,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002. Non-obligated debt service rent
to NHI was $7,974,000 in 2004, $7,369,000 in 2003, and $6,828,000 in 2002. At December 31, 2004, the
approximate future minimum base rent and non-obligated debt service rent to be paid by us on non-cancelable operating leases with NHI during the initial term are as follows Total Commitments Including

Thereafter  Advisory Agreement Until November 1, 2004, we had an Advisory Agreement with NHI whereby we provided to NHI
services related to investment activities and day-to-day management and operations. With respect to
advisory services provided to NHI, we were subject to the supervision of and policies established by NHI
Board of Directors. Our executive management officers serve in the same executive positions for NHI. During 2004, 2003, and 2002, our compensation under the NHI Advisory Agreement was
$2,383,000, $2,597,000, and $2,479,000, respectively.
Effective November 1, 2004, our Advisory Agreement with NHI was assigned to HealthCare
Advisors LLC, a new independent company formed by NHI President and Board Chairman, W. Andrew
Adams. Therefore, Mr. Adams has assumed the responsibilities of the Advisory Agreement. To assure
independence from NHC, Mr. Adams has resigned as CEO and terminated his managerial responsibilities
with NHC. He will outsource non-managerial functions of the Advisory Agreement such as payroll
processing and the like to NHC. During the immediate future, Mr. Adams will remain on the NHC Board
as Chairman, focusing on strategic planning, but will have no management involvement with NHC. 
Management Services NHI operates certain long-term health care centers on which it has foreclosed, has accepted deeds
in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise has obtained possession of the related assets. NHI has engaged us to
manage these foreclosure properties. See Notes 1 and 5 for additional information on management fees
recognized from NHI. During 2004 or prior, NHI sold or closed all of these properties and NHC now
manages for others the properties that continue to operate.
Accounting Treatment of the Transfer We have accounted for the conveyance in 1991 of assets and related debt to NHI and the
subsequent leasing of the real estate assets as a financing/leasing arrangement. Since we remain obligated
on certain of the transferred debt, the obligated debt balances have been reflected on the consolidated balance
sheets as debt serviced by other parties. As of December 31, 2004, we remain obligated on $1,723,000 of
debt serviced by other parties. As we utilize the applicable real estate over the lease term, our consolidated
statements of income will reflect the continued interest expenses on the obligated debt balances and the
additional base and non-obligated debt service rents as an operating expense payable to NHI each year.
We have indemnification provisions in our agreements with NHI if we are required to service the debt
through a default by NHI.
Release from Debt Serviced by Other Parties Since 1991, we have been released from our obligation on a significant portion of transferred debt.
Since we are no longer obligated on this transferred debt, debt serviced by other parties and assets under
arrangement with other parties were reduced by the amount of the debt serviced by other parties from which
we were removed. The resulting deferred lease credit is being amortized into income over the remaining
lease term. The leases with NHI provide that we shall continue to make non-obligated debt service rent
payments equal to the debt service including principal and interest on the obligated debt from which we have
been released. 
Investment in NHI Common Stock At December 31, 2004, we own 1,049,300 shares or 38% of NHI outstanding common stock.
We account for our investment in NHI common stock as available for sale marketable securities in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 115. 
Note 4 - Relationship with National Health Corporation National, which is wholly-owned by the ESOP, was formed in 1986 and served as our administrative
general partner through December 31, 1997, when we operated as a master limited partnership. As discussed
below, the personnel conducting our business, including our executive management team, are employees of
National and have ownership interest in National through their participation in the ESOP.
Sale of Long-Term Health Care Centers to and Notes Receivable from National During 1988, we sold the assets inventory, property and equipment of eight long-term health care
centers 1,121 licensed beds to National for a total consideration of $40,000,000. The consideration
consisted of $30,000,000 in cash and a $10,000,000 note receivable due December 31, 2007. The note
receivable earns interest at 85%. We have agreed to manage the centers under a 20-year management
contract for management fees comparable to those in the industry. With our prior consent, National sold one
center to an unrelated third party in 1997 and two centers to an unrelated third party in 1999. Thus, we now
manage five centers for National. See Notes 1 and 5 for additional information on management fees
recognized from National. Our carrying amount in the assets sold was approximately $24,255,000. The resulting profit of
$15,745,000 was deferred and will be amortized into income beginning with the collection of the note
receivable up to $12,000,000 with the balance $3,745,000 of the profit being amortized into income on
a straight-line basis over the management contract period. In conjunction with our management contract, we have entered into a line of credit arrangement
whereby we may have amounts due to or due from National from time to time. The maximum available
borrowings under the line of credit are $2,000,000, the interest rate on the line of credit is prime plus one
percent and the final maturity is January 1, 2008. NHC owes National $1,181,000 and $272,000 at
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively, under this arrangement. These amounts have been
included in or netted against notes receivable from National on the consolidated balance sheets. After
January 1, 2008, we will no longer be obligated to make loans under the line of credit arrangement. We may,
however, make short-term loans in the regular course of business. 
ESOP Financing Activities During 1988, we obtained from National long-term financing of $8,500,000 for the construction of
our headquarters building. National obtained its financing through the ESOP. The note requires quarterly
principal and interest payments with interest at 9% and is secured by the headquarters building. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the outstanding balance on the note was approximately $1,557,000 and
$2,075,000, respectively, which is included in notes and other obligations in Note 10. The building is owned
by a separate partnership of which we are the general partner and building tenants are limited partners. We
own 697% of the partnership and consolidate the financial statements of the partnership in our consolidated
financial statements. The cumulative equity in earnings of the partnership related to the limited partners'
ownership is reflected in minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. We have guaranteed the debt
service of the building partnership. In addition, our $6,097,000 senior secured notes described in Note 10 were financed by National.
National obtained its financing through the ESOP. Our interest costs, financing expenses and principal
payments with National are consistent with National and the ESOP terms with their respective lenders.
We also have agreed to guarantee $9,951,000 of additional debt of National and the ESOP that is not
reflected in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 for additional information on guarantees.
In May 2004, we repaid in full our senior notes in the approximate amount of $1,486,000. During 1991, we borrowed $10,000,000 from National. The term note payable requires quarterly
interest payments at 85%. The entire principal is due at maturity in 2008.
Payroll and Related Services The personnel conducting our business, including our executive management team, are employees
of National and have ownership interest in National through their participation in the ESOP. National
provides payroll services, provides employee fringe benefits, and maintains certain liability insurance. We
pay to National all the costs of personnel employed for our benefit, as well as an administrative fee equal
to 1% of payroll costs. Such costs totaling approximately $276,000,000, $254,000,000, and $239,000,000
for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are reflected as salaries, wages and benefits in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. The administrative fee paid to National for 2004, 2003, and 2002 was
$2,303,000, $2,138,000, and $2,084,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we owed
National $1,181,000 and $272,000, respectively, as a result of the differences between interim payments for
payroll and benefits services costs that we made during the respective year and such actual costs. These
receivables are included in or netted against notes receivable from National in the consolidated balance
sheets. National maintains and makes contributions to its ESOP for the benefit of eligible employees.
Notes Receivable from the ESOP During 2000, we purchased at face value from NHI $23,200,000 of notes receivable due from the
ESOP. NHI had purchased the note receivable from the previous holders which were banks. The total
outstanding balance of the notes receivable was $-0- and $5,714,000 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The notes receivable represent funds that were originally obtained by the ESOP from outside
lenders and loaned to National and subsequently loaned by National to NHI, NHR and NHC. In May 2004,
the notes were repaid in full. NHI repaid $2,400,000 of the notes, NHR repaid $1,828,000 of the notes and
we repaid $1,486,000 of the notes. 
National Ownership of Our Stock At December 31, 2004, National owns 1,217,147 shares or approximately 100% of our outstanding
common stock.
Note 5 - Other Revenues and Income Other revenues are outlined in the table below. Revenues from insurance services include premiums
for workers' compensation and professional and general liability insurance policies that our wholly-owned
insurance subsidiaries have written for certain long-term health care centers to which we provide
management or accounting services. Revenues from management and accounting services include
management and accounting fees and revenues from other services provided to managed and other long-term
health care centers. Other revenues include non-health care related earnings. in thousands Year ended December 31 2004

Note 9 - Notes Receivable At December 31, 2003, the outstanding principal balances of notes receivable from NHR, National
and the ESOP were $14,924,000, $9,728,000 and $5,714,000, respectively. During 2004, the balance of the
notes receivable from NHR and the ESOP have been repaid. At December 31, 2004, we have notes
receivable from National of approximately $10,000,000. In addition to our notes receivable from National, NHR and the ESOP, we have notes receivable
from managed and other long-term health care centers, the proceeds of which were used by the long-term
health care centers for construction costs, development costs incurred during construction and working
capital during initial operating periods. The notes generally require monthly payments with maturities
beginning in 2005 through 2007. Interest on the notes is generally at rates ranging from prime plus 2% to
7%. The collateral for the notes consists of first and second mortgages, certificates of need, personal
guarantees and stock pledges. During 2002, based on analyses consistent with the provisions of SFAS 114,
we concluded that two of our notes receivable were impaired and that write-downs were required. During
the first quarter of 2002, we wrote-off a $2,760,000 mortgage note receivable from a long-term health care
facility in Missouri. During the third quarter of 2002, we wrote-down $5,200,000 of a mortgage note
receivable from a long-term health care facility in Tennessee. Our recorded investment in these impaired
notes receivable was $-0- at December 31, 2004 and 2003 and $7,246,000 at December 31, 2002. With
respect to these impaired notes receivable, during 2004, 2003 and 2002, our average recorded investment
was $-0-, $5,309,000, and $14,076,000, respectively, and the interest income recognized was $-0-, $690,000,
and $74,000, respectively. We continually monitor and evaluate the carrying amount of our notes receivable
in accordance with SFAS 114. In December 2003, we received full repayment approximately $12,000,000 of the mortgage note
receivable from the long-term health care facility located in Tennessee. The repayment resulted in a recovery
of the mortgage note receivable previously written down by approximately $5,124,000. In order to repay
NHC, the facility obtained financing from a commercial bank. As a part of the transaction, we agreed to
purchase the loan from the lending bank in the event of a default and agreed to collateralize such purchase
obligation with $12,000,000 of cash. Consistent with the provisions of FIN 45, we have recorded a liability
for our guarantees in the amount of $5,124,000, which is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. On July 30, 2004, a third party refinanced approximately $12,000,000 of the debt previously we
guaranteed. The refinancing was accomplished by the sale of $15,000,000 face value of tax exempt bonds
which NHC purchased. We believe that our risks related to this transaction are unchanged by these
subsequent events and, therefore, we did not recognize any additional gains or losses. As of December 31, 2004, we have accrued approximately $7,376,000 for potential losses as a result
of our purchase of the tax exempt bonds. We continually monitor and evaluate the carrying amount of our
notes receivable in accordance with SFAS 114.

from National. National obtained its financing through the ESOP. As we are a direct obligor on this debt,
it has been reflected in the table above as liabilities owed by us to the holders of the debt instruments rather
than as liabilities owed to National and the ESOP.   Of the $1,966,000 notes and other obligations, $1,557,000 is owed to National. The note is secured

specified operating ratios as well as specified levels of working capital and stockholders' equity by us and
by National. All such covenants have been met by us and we believe that National is in compliance with or
has obtained waivers or amendments to remedy all events of non-compliance with the covenants as of
December 31, 2004.
Lease Commitments Operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 include expenses for

During 2004, $6,359,000 was credited to additional paid-in capital.  NHC continually evaluates for tax related contingencies. Contingencies may arise where tax laws
may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment.
We believe we have adequate provisions for tax contingencies. However, because of uncertainty of
interpretation by various tax authorities and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized
by management, we cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities. We believe we have
made adequate provision for tax contingencies.
Note 12 - Stock Option Plan We have incentive option plans that provide for the granting of options to key employees and
directors to purchase shares of common stock at no less than market value on the date of grant. Options
issued to non-employee directors vest immediately. Options issued to employees vest over a six year period.

of stock through payroll deductions. The plan allows employees to terminate participation at any time. In connection with the exercise of certain stock options, we have received 557% interest-bearing,
full recourse notes in the amount of $16,000 at December 31, 2003. The notes were repaid in 2004.  During 2003, we accepted unexercised stock options for 55,000 shares of our common stock from
a former employee and current member of our board of directors in satisfaction of that individual $433,000
note payable to us. We recognized $433,000 of salaries, wages and benefits expense in the 2003
consolidated statement of income. 
Note 13 - Contingencies and Guarantees Self Insurance
We have assumed certain self-insurance risks related to health insurance, workers' compensation
and general and professional liability insurance claims both for our owned or leased entities and certain of
the entities to which we provide management or accounting services. The liability we have recognized for
reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims is $62,354,000 and $43,953,000 at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The liability is included in accrued risk reserves in the
consolidated balance sheets. The amounts are subject to adjustment for actual claims incurred. It is possible
that these claims plus unasserted claims could exceed our insurance coverages and our reserves, which would
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Workers' Compensation For workers' compensation, we utilize a wholly-owned Tennessee domiciled property/casualty
insurance company to write coverage for NHC affiliates and for third-party customers. Policies are written
for a duration of twelve months and cover only risks related to workers' compensation losses. All customers
are companies which operate in the long-term care industry. Business is written on both an assumed and a
direct basis. For the business written on an assumed basis the insurance company assumes only the first
$750,000 of losses for each claim. For direct business, coverage is written for statutory limits and the
insurance company losses in excess of $500,000 per claim are covered by reinsurance.  For these insurance operations, the premium revenues reflected in the financial statements as Other
revenues for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are $12,996,000, $10,641,000 and $6,847,000. Associated
losses and expenses reflected in the financial statements as Other operating costs and expenses are
$9,488,000, $5,543,000 and $4,003,000 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As a result of the terms of our insurance policies and our use of a wholly-owned insurance company,
we have retained significant self insurance risk with respect to workers' compensation liability. We use
independent actuaries to estimate our exposures for claims obligations for both asserted and unasserted
claims related to deductibles and exposures in excess of coverage limits, and we maintain reserves for these
obligations. It is possible that claims against us could exceed our coverage limits and our reserves, which
would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
General and Professional Liability Lawsuits and Insurance Nationwide, the entire long term care industry has experienced a dramatic increase in personal
injury/wrongful death claims and awards based on alleged negligence by nursing facilities and their
employees in providing care to residents. As of December 31, 2004, we and/or our managed centers are
currently defendants in 51 such claims covering the years 1995 through December 31, 2004. Fourteen of
these suits are in Florida, where we have not operated or managed long-term care providers since September
30, 2000. In addition, two suits are currently pending in relation to the September 25, 2003 fire discussed
below. When bids were solicited for third party professional liability insurance coverage for 2002, only two
companies would quote coverage. Both quotations were so onerous and expensive that we elected to pay
the premiums into a wholly-owned licensed captive insurance company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands,
for the purpose of managing the Company losses related to these risks. Thus, during 2002, 2003 and 2004,
insurance coverage for incidents occurring at all providers owned or leased, and most providers managed
by us, is provided through this wholly-owned insurance company. Policies are written for a duration of
twelve months. Our coverages for all years include primary policies and umbrella policies. For years 1999 through
2001, the policies contain a per incident deductible. In 2001, there is no aggregate limit on our potential
deductible obligations. In 2002, the deductibles were eliminated and first dollar coverage is provided
through the wholly-owned insurance company, while the excess coverage is provided by a third party
insuror.  In 2003 and 2004, primary professional liability insurance coverage and excess coverage is provided
through our wholly-owned liability insurance company in the amount of $1 million per incident, $3 million
per location with an aggregate primary policy limit of $110 million and $120 million, respectively, and a
$75 million annual excess aggregate.  For these insurance operations, the premium revenues reflected in the financials as Other revenues
for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are $16,848,000, $14,585,000, and $8,930,000. Associated losses
and expenses in the financial statements as Other operating costs and expenses are $28,393,000 11,707,000, and $6,405,000 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As a result of the terms of our insurance policies and our use of a wholly-owned insurance company,
we have retained significant self insurance risk with respect to general and professional liability. We use
independent actuaries to estimate our exposures for claims obligations for both asserted and unasserted
claims related to deductibles and exposures in excess of coverage limits, and we maintain reserves for these
obligations. It is possible that claims against us could exceed our coverage limits and our reserves, which
would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
Nashville Fire On September 25, 2003, a tragic and as of yet unexplained fire occurred on the second floor of a
skilled nursing facility located in Nashville, Tennessee operated by one of our limited liability company
subsidiaries. While the concrete and steel constructed facility complied with applicable fire safety codes,
the building was not equipped with fire sprinklers. There have been sixteen patient deaths since the fire, an
undetermined number of which may be related to the events of September 25, 2003. The fire produced extensive media coverage, specifically focused on the fact that health care centers,
including hospitals, constructed prior to 1994 are not required by Tennessee law or regulations to be fully
sprinkled if constructed with fire resistant materials. We have announced that irrespective of code standards,
we will commence a process of fully sprinkling all facilities operated by NHC that are not already fully
sprinkled. We have created through our National Health Foundation a qualified 501c3 charity a patient
and family relief fund, which is being administered separately from other funds of the Foundation by families
of Nashville patients. The prayers and best wishes of the NHC family partners have gone forth to all patients
and families affected by this fire. We are proactively seeking to resolve any questions and/or losses with
our patients and their families, and will continue to do so until all matters are resolved. Of a total of 32
lawsuits filed against us, 30 have been settled and two lawsuits currently pending. The cases were
consolidated in the Third Circuit Court for Davidson County, Tennessee. Discovery is ongoing in the
remaining two cases. The Company plans to vigorously defend against the allegations in these lawsuits and
seek settlements with residents and their families. Additionally, in connection with the fire, we have incurred losses and costs associated with
interruption of business, as we have closed the center for an indefinite period of time. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, we have received or accrued $1,404,000 of insurance recoveries from third-party
insurance carriers. These insurance recoveries have reduced our losses and costs and have been included
in other operating expenses in the 2004 consolidated statement of income. The building involved in the fire is leased by one of our limited liability company subsidiaries from
NHI. Under the terms of the lease with NHI, we are required to restore the leased property so as to make
it at least equal in value to that which existed prior to the damage. The lease also requires us to indemnify
and hold harmless NHI from any and all demands and claims arising from the use of the property, including
any negligence or violation by us.  A provision of the lease allows that if substantial damage occurs during the lease term, we may
terminate the lease with respect to the damaged property. If the lease is so terminated, we will have no
obligation to repair the property and NHI will receive the entire insurance proceeds related to the building
damage. We are obligated to continue to indemnify and hold harmless NHI from any and all demands
arising from the use of the property. NHI retains the right to license the beds under any lease termination. Consistent with the provisions of SFAS 5, we have accrued for probable and estimatible losses
related to the Nashville fire and have included our estimates of these losses in accrued risk reserves in the
consolidated balance sheet. It is possible that claims against us related to the Nashville fire could exceed
our estimates, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.
Guarantees In addition to our primary debt obligations, which are included in our consolidated financial
statements, we have guaranteed the debt obligations of certain other entities. Those guarantees, which are
not included as debt obligations in our consolidated financial statements, total $17,375,000 at December 31,
2004 and include $7,424,000 of debt of managed and other long-term health care centers and $9,951,000 of
debt of National and the ESOP.  The $7,424,000 of guarantees of debt of managed and other long-term health care centers relates to
first mortgage debt obligations of three long-term health care centers to which we provide management or
accounting services. We have agreed to guarantee these obligations in order to obtain management or
accounting services agreements. For this service, we charge an annual guarantee fee of 1% to 2% of the
outstanding principal balance guaranteed, which fee is in addition to our management or accounting services
fee. All of this guaranteed indebtedness is secured by first mortgages, pledges of personal property, accounts
receivable, marketable securities and, in certain instances, the personal guarantees of the owners of the
facilities.  The $9,951,000 of guarantees of debt of National and the ESOP relates to senior secured notes held
by financial institutions. The total outstanding balance of National and the ESOP obligations under these
senior secured notes is $16,048,000. As discussed in Note 10, $6,097,000 of this obligation has been
included in our debt obligations because we are a direct obligor on this indebtedness. The remaining
$9,951,000, which is not included in our debt obligations because we are not a direct obligor, is due from
NHI to National and the ESOP and ultimately to the financial institutions. Additionally, under the amended
terms of these note agreements, the lending institutions have the right to put to us the entire outstanding
balance of this debt on March 31, 2005. Upon exercise of this put option by the lending institutions, we
would be obligated to purchase the then outstanding balance of these senior secured notes, which is estimated
to be approximately $15,116,000.  As of December 31, 2004, our maximum potential loss related to the guarantees is $18,419,000,
which is the outstanding balance of the guaranteed debt obligations. We have accrued approximately
$1,044,000 for potential losses as a result of our guarantees, which is included in other noncurrent liabilities
in the consolidated balance sheets.
Debt Cross Defaults Through a guarantee agreement, our senior secured notes have cross-default provisions with other
debt of National and the ESOP. We currently believe that National and the ESOP are in compliance with
the terms of their debt agreements. Under the terms of one of National debt obligations to financial
institutions total balance of $6,488,000 at December 31, 2004, none of which is our obligation, the lending
institutions have the right to put the entire outstanding balance of the debt to National in March 2005.
National plans to be able to refinance this debt prior to the put date or pay off the debt completely. However,
if the lending institutions do exercise that put option and National is unable to purchase or refinance the
entire outstanding balance of the debt, National other debt along with our senior secured notes and
substantially all of our other debt would be in default, which would have a material adverse effect on NHC
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Note 14 - Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments To meet the reporting requirements of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, we calculate the fair value of financial instruments
using discounted cash flow techniques. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no material differences
between the carrying amounts and fair values of our financial instruments. Selected Quarterly Financial Data
