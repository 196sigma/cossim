BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATIONThe Company is an investor-owned healthcare company whose subsidiaries and affiliates own and operate hospitals and related healthcare businesses in urban and suburban areas. As of June30, 2012, the Companys subsidiaries and affiliates owned and operated 28acute care hospitals with 7,064licensed beds and related outpatient service locations complementary to the hospitals providing healthcare services in San Antonio, Harlingen and Brownsville, Texas; metropolitan Detroit, Michigan; metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona; metropolitan Chicago, Illinois; and Massachusetts. The Company also owns managed health plans in Chicago, Illinois, Harlingen, Texas, and Phoenix, Arizona, and twosurgery centers in Orange County, California.Initial Public OfferingIn June 2011, Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. the Company completed the initial public offering of 25,000,000shares of common stock. The Companys common stock is now traded on the New York Stock Exchange symbol VHS. Including the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option in July 2011 of 3,750,000shares, a total of 28,750,000shares were sold. Immediately prior to the public offering, the Company completed a 59584218-to-1split of its issued and outstanding common shares. All common share and per common share amounts in these consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements reflect the stock split.Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries and affiliates controlled by the Company. The Company generally defines control as the ownership of the majority of an entitys voting interests. The Company also consolidates any entities for which it receives the majority of the entitys expected returns or is at risk for the majority of the entitys expected losses based upon its investment or financial interest in the entity. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The share and earnings per share information included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and included in Note 10 reflect the impact of the stock split that the Company effectuated in connection with the initial public offering of its common stock. The majority of the Companys expenses are cost of revenue items. Costs that could be classified as general and administrative include certain Company corporate office costs, which approximated $658 million, $719 millionand $671 millionfor the years ended June30, 2010, 2011and 2012, respectively.Certain balances in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and these notes have been adjusted to reflect the retroactive application of the contingency model for recognizing Medicare and Medicaid electronic health record EHR initiatives as further described in Note 2.Use of EstimatesIn preparing the Companys financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recorded or classification of items in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESRevenues and Revenue DeductionsPatient Service RevenuesThe Company recognizes patient service revenues during the period the healthcare services are provided based upon estimated amounts due from payers. The Company estimates contractual adjustments and allowances based upon payment terms set forth in managed care health plan contracts and by federal and state regulations. For the majority of its patient service revenues, the Company applies contractual adjustments to patient accounts at the time of billing using specific payer contract terms entered into the accounts receivable systems, but in some cases the Company records an estimated allowance until payment is received. The Company derives most of its patient service revenues from healthcare services provided to patients with Medicare and related managed Medicare plans or managed care insurance coverage. Medicare, which represented approximately 27%, 28%and 28%of the Companys net patient revenues during its fiscal years ended 2010, 2011and 2012, respectively, was the only individual payer for which the Company derived more than 10%of net patient revenues during those periods114Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedServices provided to Medicare and related managed Medicare patients are generally reimbursed at prospectively determined rates per diagnosis PPS, while services provided to managed care patients are generally reimbursed based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted fee-for-service rates. Medicaid reimbursements vary by state.Medicare regulations and the Companys principal managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in its healthcare facilities. To obtain reimbursement for certain services under the Medicare program, the Company must submit annual cost reports and record estimates of amounts owed to or receivable from Medicare. These cost reports include complex calculations and estimates related to indirect medical education, disproportionate share payments, reimbursable Medicare bad debts and other items that are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from recorded estimates. The Company estimates amounts owed to or receivable from the Medicare program using the best information available and its interpretation of the applicable Medicare regulations. The Company includes differences between original estimates and subsequent revisions to those estimates including final cost report settlements in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the revisions are made. Net adjustments for final third party settlements increased patient service revenues and income from continuing operations by $66 million$41 millionnet of taxes or $009per diluted share, $73 million$45 millionnet of taxes or $010per diluted share and $67 million$41 millionnet of taxes or $005per diluted share during the fiscal years ended 2010, 2011and 2012, respectively. Additionally, updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently, which necessitates continual review of estimation processes by management. Management believes that future adjustments to its current third party settlement estimates will not significantly impact the Companys results of operations or financial position.Rural Floor ProvisionThe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 BBA established a rural floor provision, by which an urban hospital wage index within a particular state could not be lower than the statewide rural wage index. The wage index reflects the relative hospital wage level compared to the applicable average hospital wage level. BBA also made this provision budget neutral, meaning that total wage index payments nationwide before and after the implementation of this provision must remain the same. To accomplish this, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS was required to increase the wage index for all affected urban hospitals, and to then calculate a rural floor budget neutrality adjustment RFBNA to reduce other wage indexes in order to maintain the same level of payments. Litigation had been pending for several years contending that CMS had miscalculated the RFBNA since 1999.The related litigation was settled in April 2012. As a result of the settlement, the Company received additional Medicare payments of approximately $406 millionin May and June 2012. This amount was recorded as additional revenues during the fiscal year ended June30, 2012. Estimated direct related expenses of approximately $78 millionwere recorded for the fiscal year ended June30, 2012. Net income attributable to Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. stockholders was positively impacted from the rural floor provision by $217 million$028per diluted share for the fiscal year ended June30, 2012. Supplemental Security Income Payment CalculationsDuring March 2012, CMS issued new Supplemental Security Income SSI ratios used for calculating Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital DSH reimbursement for federal fiscal years FFYs ending September 30, 2006 through September 30, 2009. As a result of these new SSI ratios, U.S. hospitals must recalculate their Medicare DSH reimbursement for the affected years and record adjustments for any differences in estimated reimbursement as a part of their annual cost report settlement process. Historically, CMS issued each hospital its SSI ratio annually, several months after the end of each fiscal year. However, CMS delayed issuing final SSI ratios for years after FFY 2005 likely due to a court case challenging the government computation of SSI ratios. This challenge, which began in 2006, was resolved in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late last year.Pending CMS issuance of new SSI ratios for FFY 2006 forward, the Company had utilized the SSI ratios that were most recently provided by CMS in filing its hospital cost reports. The cumulative impact of this updated Medicare reimbursement estimate was an increase in revenues of approximately $91 millionand an increase to net income attributable to Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. stockholders of $53 million$007per diluted share for the year ended June30, 2012. The Company receives periodic payments under the upper payment limit UPL Medicaid payment program in certain counties in Texas. UPL programs allow private hospitals to enter into indigent care affiliation agreements with governmental entities. Within the parameters of these programs, private hospitals expand charity care services to indigent patients and alleviate expenses for the governmental entity. The governmental entity is then able to utilize its tax revenue to fund the 115Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedMedicaid program for private hospitals. The Company recognizes revenues from the UPL program when the Company becomes entitled to the expected reimbursements, including a federal match portion, and such reimbursements are assured.During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the federal government approved federal matching funds for the Illinois Provider Tax Assessment PTA program. The PTA program enables the State of Illinois to increase funding for its state Medicaid plan. Hospitals providing services to Medicaid enrollees receive funds directly from the state. Hospital providers, with certain exceptions, are then assessed a provider tax, which is payable to the state, and may or may not exceed funds received from the state. The Company participates in a similar program with the state of Michigan through its DMC hospitals. The Company recognizes revenues equal to the gross PTA payments to be received when such payments are assured. The Company recognizes expenses for the taxes due back to the states under these PTA programs when the related revenues are recognized.Effective for service dates on or after April1, 2009, as a result of a state mandate, the Company implemented an uninsured discount policy for those patients receiving services in its Illinois hospitals who had no insurance coverage and who did not otherwise qualify for charity care under its guidelines. The Company implemented this same policy in its Phoenix and San Antonio hospitals effective for service dates on or after July1, 2009 and in its Harlingen and Brownsville, Texas hospitals upon acquisition of those facilities. Under this policy, the Company applies an uninsured discount calculated as a standard percentage of gross charges at the time of patient billing and includes this discount as a reduction to patient service revenues. These discounts were approximately $2772 millionand $4514 millionfor the fiscal years ended June30, 2011and 2012, respectively.Premium RevenuesThe Company had premium revenues from its health plans of $8397 million, $8694 millionand $7574 millionduring the fiscal years ended 2010, 2011and 2012, respectively. The Companys health plans, Phoenix Health Plan PHP, Abrazo Advantage Health Plan AAHP, Chicago Health System CHS and Valley Baptist Insurance Company VBIC, have agreements with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System AHCCCS, CMS and various health maintenance organizations HMOs and employers, respectively, to contract to provide medical services to subscribing participants. Under these agreements, the Companys health plans receive monthly payments based on the number of participants in CHS and VBIC or the number and coverage type of members in PHP and AAHP. The Companys health plans recognize the payments as revenues in the month in which members are entitled to healthcare services with the exception of AAHP Medicare PartD reinsurance premiums and low income subsidy cost sharing premiums that are recorded as a liability to fund future healthcare costs or else repaid to CMS.Charity Care The Company does not pursue collection of amounts due from uninsured patients that qualify for charity care under its guidelines currently those uninsured patients whose incomes are equal to or less than 200% of the current federal poverty guidelines set forth by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Company deducts charity care accounts from revenues when it determines that the account meets its charity care guidelines. The Company also generally provides discounts from billed charges and alternative payment structures for uninsured patients who do not qualify for charity care but meet certain other minimum income guidelines, primarily those uninsured patients with incomes between 200%and 500%of the federal poverty guidelines. During the years ended 2010, 2011and 2012, the Company deducted $877 million, $1215 millionand $2334 millionof charity care from revenues, respectively. The estimated cost incurred by the Company to provide services to patients who qualify for charity care was approximately $247 million, $343 millionand $658 millionfor the fiscal years ended June30, 2010, 2011and 2012, respectively. These estimates were determined using a ratio of cost to gross charges calculated from the Companys most recently filed Medicare cost reports and applying that ratio to the gross charges associated with providing charity care for the period.Medicare and Medicaid EHR IncentivesThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments beginning in calendar year 2011 for eligible hospitals and professionals that implement and achieve meaningful use of certified electronic health record EHR technology. For Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments prior to the quarter ended December31, 2011, the Company originally utilized a grant accounting model to recognize these revenues. Under this accounting policy, EHR incentive payments were recognized as revenues when attestation that the EHR meaningful use criteria for the required period of time was demonstrated and were recognized ratably over the relevant cost report period to determine the amount of reimbursement. Accordingly, the Company originally recognized approximately $119 millionof EHR revenues 116Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedduring its fiscal year ended June30, 2011, comprised of $61 millionof Medicaid revenues and $58 millionof Medicare revenues. During the quarter ended September30, 2011, the Company recognized approximately $72 millionof EHR revenues, comprised of $51 millionof Medicaid revenues and $21 millionof Medicare revenues.During the quarter ended December 31, 2011, the Company reclassified $72 millionof revenues recognized during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 from revenues to other income, as separately stated in the costs and expenses section of the Company statement of operations. Additionally, the Company recorded $154 millionof other income related to EHR incentive payments during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, $133 millionof which related to Medicaid and $21 millionof which related to Medicare. During the quarter ended December 31, 2011, the Company began utilizing the contingency accounting model for recognition of Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments. Under the contingency model, EHR incentive payments are recognized when all contingencies relating to the incentive payment have been satisfied. For Medicaid EHR incentive payments, recognition occurs at the time meaningful use criteria are met and formal state appearance is documented since Medicaid payments for the states in which the Company operates are based upon historical cost reports with no subsequent payment adjustment. For Medicare EHR incentive payments, recognition will be deferred until both the Medicare federal fiscal year during which EHR meaningful use was demonstrated ends and the cost report information utilized to determine the final amount of reimbursement is known.The Company has concluded that it should have applied the contingency model to account for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments beginning in its year ended June 30, 2011. If the Company had utilized the contingency model from the time that EHR incentive payments commenced, previously reported net income attributable to the Company stockholders would have been reduced by $11 million, reduced by $25 millionand increased by $36 millionfor the year ended June 30, 2011, the quarter ended September 30, 2011 and the quarter ended December 31, 2011, respectively, which amounts the Company deems not material. To correct these errors, the Company has retroactively applied the contingency model for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, the quarter ended September 30, 2011 and the quarter ended December 31, 2011. To reflect this correction in the Company June 30, 2012 consolidated financial statements, the Company increased its June 30, 2011 current deferred tax assets by $07 million, increased other accrued expenses and current liabilities by $18 millionand decreased retained earnings by $11 millionon the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company increased net income attributable to Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. stockholders by $11 millionduring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations to retroactively apply this correction to its current year results of operations. The $11 millionnet impact of this correction reflected in the Company results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2012 was comprised of a $25 milliondecrease for the three months ended September 30, 2011 $41 milliondecrease to Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentives, net of a $16 millionincome tax benefit and a $36 millionincrease for the three months ended December 31, 2011 $59 millionincrease to Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentives, net of a $23 millionincome tax expense.The Company recognized approximately $282 millionof other income related to Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentives during the year ended June30, 2012under the contingency model. The Company incurs both capital expenditures and operating expenses in connection with the implementation of its various EHR initiatives. The amount and timing of these expenditures do not directly correlate with the timing of the Company cash receipts or recognition of the EHR incentives as other income. As of June30, 2011and 2012, the Company had recognized approximately $61 millionand $27 millionin Medicaid EHR receivables, respectively, on its consolidated balance sheet. In addition, as of June 30, 2011 and 2012, the Company had recognized $38 millionand $43 millionin Medicare EHR deferred revenues, respectively, on its consolidated balance sheet.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of 90days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company manages its credit exposure by placing its investments in high quality securities and by periodically evaluating the relative credit standing of the financial institutions holding its cash and investments.As of June30, 2011and 2012, approximately $181 millionand $432 million, respectively, of total cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were identified for the operations of the Companys captive insurance subsidiaries117Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedAccounts ReceivableThe Companys primary concentration of credit risk is patient accounts receivable, which consists of amounts owed by various governmental agencies, insurance companies and private patients. The Company manages the receivables by regularly reviewing its accounts and contracts and by providing appropriate allowances for contractual discounts and uncollectible amounts. The Company typically writes off uncollected accounts receivable 120days subsequent to discharge date. Medicare program net receivables, including managed Medicare receivables, comprised approximately 26%and 27%of net patient receivables as of June30, 2011and 2012, respectively. Medicare revenues are included in the acute care services operating segment. Receivables from various state Medicaid programs and managed Medicaid programs comprised approximately 24%and 23%of net patient receivables as of June 30, 2011and 2012, respectively. Remaining receivables relate primarily to various HMO and Preferred Provider Organization payers, commercial insurers and private patients. Concentration of credit risk for these payers is limited by the number of patients and payers.The Company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts using a standard policy that reserves 100%of all accounts aged greater than 365days subsequent to discharge date plus a standard percentage of uninsured accounts less than 365days old plus a standard percentage of self-pay after insurance accounts less than 365days old. The Company has periodically adjusted its policy to increase the standard percentages applied to uninsured accounts and self-pay after insurance accounts to account for pricing changes and for the impact of its uninsured discount policy, as previously described in Note 2 under Patient Service Revenues. The Company tests its allowance for doubtful accounts policy quarterly using a hindsight calculation that utilizes write-off data for all payer classes during the previous 12-month period to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts at a point in time. The Company also supplements its analysis by comparing cash collections to net patient revenues and monitoring self-pay utilization. Significant changes in payer mix, business office operations, general economic conditions and healthcare coverage provided by federal or state governments or private insurers may have a significant impact on the Companys estimates and significantly affect its results of operations and cash flows.The Company classifies accounts pending Medicaid approval as self-pay accounts in its accounts receivable aging report and applies the standard uninsured discount. The net account balance is further subject to the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policy. Should the account qualify for Medicaid coverage, the previously recorded uninsured discount is reversed and the account is reclassified to Medicaid accounts receivable with the appropriate contractual discount applied. Should the account not qualify for Medicaid coverage but qualify as charity care under the Companys charity policy, the previously recorded uninsured discount is reversed and the entire account balance is recorded as a charity deduction.A summary of the Companys allowance for doubtful accounts activity, including those for discontinued operations, during the three most recent fiscal years follows in millions.Balance atBeginningof PeriodAdditionsCharged toCosts andExpensesAccountsWritten off,Net of Recoveriesand OtherBalance atEnd ofPeriodAllowance for doubtful accounts:Year ended June30,  ended June30,  ended June30,  consisting of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market.Property, Plant and EquipmentPurchases of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures that increase values, change capacities or extend useful lives are capitalized. For assets other than leasehold improvements, depreciation is computed using the straight-line half-year method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which approximate 3to 40years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the estimated useful life or term of the lease. Amortization expense for assets acquired under capital leases are included with depreciation expense. 118Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedDepreciation and amortization expense was approximately $1396 million, $1938 millionand $2583 millionfor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2011and 2012, respectively. The Company tests its property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment as management becomes aware of impairment indicators.During fiscal 2010, 2011and 2012, the Company capitalized $24 million, $56 millionand $34 millionof interest, respectively, associated with certain of its hospital construction and expansion projects. The Company estimates that it is contractually obligated to expend approximately $1816 millionrelated to projects classified as construction in progress as of June30, 2012. The Company also capitalizes costs associated with developing computer software for internal use. The Company capitalizes both internal and external direct costs, excluding training, during the application development stage primarily for the purpose of customizing vendor software to integrate with the Companys hospital information systems. The estimated net book value of capitalized internal use software included in net property, plant and equipment, was approximately $518 millionand $622 millionas of June30, 2011and 2012, respectively. The amortization expense for internal use software, included in depreciation expense, was approximately $118 million, $147 millionand $293 millionfor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2011and 2012, respectively.The following table provides the gross asset balances for each major class of asset and total accumulated depreciation as of June30, 2011and 2012in millions.June30, 2011June30, 2012Class of asset:Land and  and  in  accumulated  property, plant and  Assets and GoodwillGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a level referred to as a reporting unit. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment review process is unnecessary. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment review process. In 2012, the Company elected not to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for goodwill but instead to complete the quantitative analysis. The first step of the quantitative two-step process involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow DCF analysis. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The significant judgments are typically based upon Level 3 inputs, generally defined as unobservable inputs representing the Company own assumptions. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on the Company most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates are assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination i.e., the estimated 119Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedfair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.The Company 2012 annual impairment analysis did not result in any impairments of the Company goodwill. However, the Company Arizona hospitals reporting unit experienced market challenges that negatively impacted its results of operations and cash flows during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. These factors included hospital reimbursement cuts, reductions to covered lives under the state AHCCCS program and local economic conditions that adversely impacted elective volumes for these hospitals. Based upon the implementation of certain cost reduction initiatives, expected improvements in the local economic and state financial conditions and the demographic composition of this market, the Company believes future operating results and cash flows of these hospitals will improve. However, the Company will continue to monitor the operating results of these hospitals and other market environmental factors to determine if further impairment considerations are necessary with respect to the $1007 millionof goodwill for this reporting unit.Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmounts allocated to contract-based intangible assets, which primarily represent PHPs contract with AHCCCS and PHPs various contracts with network providers, are amortized over their useful lives, which equal tenyears. The expected future cash flows supporting the value of contract-based intangible assets are affected by the Companys ability and intent to renew or extend the related PHP contracts. No amortization is recorded for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Deferred loan costs and syndication costs are amortized over the life of the applicable credit facility or notes using the effective interest method. Physician income and service agreement guarantee intangible assets are recorded based upon the estimated future payments under the contracts and are amortized over the applicable contract service periods. The useful lives over which intangible assets are amortized range from two years to ten years.Investments in SecuritiesInvestments in securities include debt and equity securities and are classified as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity or as part of a trading portfolio. As of June30, 2011 and 2012, the Company held nosignificant investments in securities classified as either held-to-maturity or trading. Investments in securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income lossunless the unrealized loss is determined to be other-than-temporary, at which point the Company would record a loss in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company calculates the realized gain or loss on sales of investments using the amortized cost basis, as determined by specific identification. See Note 4 for more information regarding the Company investments in securities.Escrowed Cash for Capital CommitmentsIn connection with the Company acquisition of The Detroit Medical Center DMC, certain capital commitments were agreed upon to be satisfied at particular dates. Since a portion of these commitments were not met at the first required date, the Company escrowed cash for the purpose of funding capital projects. These funds represent restricted cash that are to be used to acquire long-term assets. Since the funds deposited into escrow for DMC asset purchases represent a contractual obligation to fund long-term capital assets, the Company deems it proper to present the funds as a noncurrent asset on its consolidated balance sheet until the obligation has been satisfied. Accrued Health Plan Claims and SettlementsDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2011and 2012, health plan claims expense was $6658 million, $6863 millionand $5789 million, respectively, primarily representing health claims incurred by members in PHP. Vanguard estimates PHPs reserve for health claims using historical claims experience including cost per member and payment lag time and other actuarial data including number of members and certain member demographic information. Accrued health plan claims and settlements, including incurred but not reported claims and net amounts payable to AHCCCS and CMS for certain programs for which profitability is limited, for all the Company health plans combined was approximately $1149 millionand $678 millionas of June30, 2011and 2012, respectively. While management believes that its estimation methodology effectively captures trends in medical claims costs, actual payments could differ significantly from its estimates given changes in the healthcare cost structure or adverse experience. Due to changes in historical claims trends during its fiscal years ended June30, 2010, 2011and 2012, the Company decreased its health plan claims and settlements reserve related to prior fiscal year health claims by $49 120Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedmillion$30 millionnet of taxes or $007per diluted share, $127 million$78 millionnet of taxes or $017per diluted share and $145 million$88 millionnet of taxes or $011per diluted share. Additional adjustments to prior year estimates may be necessary in future periods as more information becomes available.During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2011and 2012, approximately $428 million, $413 millionand $424 million, respectively, of accrued and paid claims for services provided to the Companys health plan members by its hospitals and its other healthcare facilities were eliminated in consolidation. The Companys operating results and cash flows could be materially affected by increased or decreased utilization of its healthcare facilities by members in its health plans.Employee Health Insurance ReserveThe Company covers substantially all of its employees under self-insured medical plans. Claims are accrued under the self-insured medical plans as the incidents that give rise to them occur. Unpaid claims accruals are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settlement, including claim settlement expenses, in accordance with an average lag time and historical experience. The reserve for self-insured medical plans was approximately $306 millionand $289 millionas of June30, 2011and 2012, respectively, and is included in accrued salaries and benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company mitigated its self-insured risk by purchasing stop-loss coverage for catastrophic claims for a portion of its covered employees at a $500,000per enrollee annual limit. During the fiscal years ended June30, 2011and 2012, approximately $587 millionand $758 million, respectively, of medical claims expense was eliminated in consolidation related to self-insured medical claims expense incurred and revenues earned due to employee utilization of the Companys healthcare facilities.Professional and General Liability and Workers Compensation ReservesGiven the nature of its operating environment, the Company is subject to professional and general liability and workers compensation claims and related lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. The Company maintains professional and general liability insurance with unrelated commercial insurance carriers to provide for losses up to $650 millionin excess of its self-insured retention such self-insured retention maintained through the Companys wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and/or another of its wholly-owned subsidiaries of $100 millionthrough June30, 2010 but increased to $150 millionfor its Illinois hospitals subsequent to June30, 2010.Through the fiscal year ended June30, 2010, the Company insured its excess coverage under a retrospectively rated policy, and premiums under this policy were recorded based on the Companys historical claims experience. The Company self-insures its workers compensation claims at levels ranging from $06 millionto $10 millionper claim and purchases excess insurance coverage for claims exceeding these self-insured limits.The Companys total reserves for professional and general liability as of June30, 2011and 2012were $3268 millionand$3402 million, respectively. As of June30, 2011and 2012, the reserves for workers compensation were $321 millionand $343 million, respectively. The current portion of the total professional and general liability and workers compensation reserves as of June 30, 2011 and 2012 was $692 millionand $697 million, respectively, and is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company utilizes actuarial information to estimate its reserves for professional and general liability and workers compensation claims. Each reserve is comprised of estimated indemnity and expense payments related to: 1reported events case reserves and 2incurred but not reported events IBNR as of the end of the period. Management uses information from its risk managers and its best judgment to estimate case reserves. Actuarial IBNR estimates are dependent on multiple variables including the Companys risk exposures, its self-insurance limits, geographic locations in which it operates, the severity of its historical losses compared to industry averages and the reporting pattern of its historical losses compared to industry averages, among others. Most of these variables require judgment, and changes in these variables could result in significant period over period fluctuations in the Companys estimates. The Company discounts its workers compensation reserve using a 4%factor, an actuarial estimate of projected cash payments in future periods. The Company does not discount the reserve for estimated professional and general liability claims.The Company adjusts these reserves from time to time as it receives updated information. Due to changes in historical loss trends, during its fiscal year ended June30, 2010, the Company increased its professional and general liability reserve related to prior fiscal years by $84 million$52 millionnet of taxes or $012per diluted share. During its fiscal year ended June30, 2011, the Company decreased its professional liability and general reserve related to prior fiscal years by $54 million$33 millionnet of taxes or $007per diluted share. During its fiscal year ended June30, 2012, the Company increased its professional liability and general reserve related to prior fiscal years by $05 million$03 millionnet of taxes or $001per diluted share. 121Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedSimilarly, the Company decreased its workers compensation reserve related to prior fiscal years by $51 million$31 millionnet of taxes or $007per diluted share, $43 million$26 millionnet of taxes or $006per diluted share and $03 million$02 millionnet of taxes, respectively, during its fiscal years ended June30, 2010, 2011and 2012. Additional adjustments to prior year estimates may be necessary in future periods as the Companys reporting history and loss portfolio matures.Pension PlanUpon completing the acquisition of DMC on January1, 2011, the Company assumed a frozen noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan DMC Pension Plan covering substantially all of the employees of DMC and its subsidiaries hired prior to June1, 2003. The benefits paid under the DMC Pension Plan are primarily based on years of service and final average earnings.The DMC Pension Plan is measured using actuarial techniques that reflect managements assumptions for discount rates relative to the projected benefit obligation and the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost, expected long-term investment returns on plan assets, expected retirement and mortality. Management utilizes an independent actuary in determining these estimates. The accounting guidance related to employers accounting for defined benefit pension plans requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension plans, and the recognition in other comprehensive income loss of unrecognized gains or losses and prior service costs or credits. Additionally, the guidance requires the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the plan sponsors year end. As of June30, 2012, the Company had an accumulated comprehensive loss of $806 million$492 million, net of tax related to the DMC Pension Plan.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestIn September 2011, the Company obtained a 51%controlling interest in a partnership that held the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the purchase of Valley Baptist Health Systems as more fully discussed in Note 3. The remaining 49%non-controlling interest was granted to the former owner of Valley Baptist the seller as purchase consideration. The partnership operating agreement includes an option by which the seller may put its 49% non-controlling interest back to the Company upon either the third or fifth anniversary of the transaction date. The redemption value is calculated based upon the operating results and the debt of the partnership, but is subject to a floor value. The Company also has the option to call a stated percentage of the seller non-controlling interest in the event the seller does not exercise its put option on either of the anniversary dates.  The Company redeemable noncontrolling interest RNCI includes redemption features that cause the interest not to meet the requirements for classification as equity. Redemption of the RNCI feature would require either the delivery of cash or the issuance of shares. It is the Company intent to settle this redemption in cash. Accordingly, the RNCI is classified in the mezzanine section of the Company accompanying consolidated balance sheets under the caption Redeemable noncontrolling interests. The Company recorded the opening balance of RNCI at the estimated fair value and elected to accrete the issue date fair value of the RNCI to maximum redemption value over time. Any subsequent change to the estimated redemption will be recorded as an adjustment to equity. With respect to the calculation of earnings per share, in instances where the maximum redemption amount exceeds fair value, this excess would result in a decrease to net income available to common stockholders. Alternatively, in instances where the fair value exceeds maximum redemption amount, net income available to common stockholders would be increased only to the extent that decreases had been recognized in previous periods. Any changes in estimate from period to period would be accreted over the remaining quarters until the first put option measurement date third anniversary of the acquisition on a prospective basis. Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This guidance requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.The Company believes that its tax return provisions are accurate and supportable, but certain tax matters require interpretations of tax law that may be subject to future challenge and may not be upheld under tax audit. To reflect the 122Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedpossibility that all of its tax positions may not be sustained, the Company maintains tax reserves that are subject to adjustment as updated information becomes available or as circumstances change. The Company records the impact of tax reserve changes to its income tax provision in the period in which the additional information, including the progress of tax audits, is obtained.The Company assesses the realization of its deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified, the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The factors used in this determination include the following:cumulative losses in recent years;income/losses expected in future years;unsettled circumstances that, if favorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations;availability, or lack thereof, of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits;carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities; andprudent and feasible tax planning strategies.In addition, financial forecasts used in determining the need for or amount of federal and state valuation allowances are subject to changes in underlying assumptions and fluctuations in market conditions that could significantly alter the Companys recoverability analysis and thus have a material adverse impact on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Stock-Based CompensationThe Company records stock-based employee compensation for options granted subsequent to July1, 2006 using a Black-Scholes-Merton model. The following table sets forth the range of assumptions the Company has utilized in the Black-Scholes-Merton model.Risk-free interest rate124%to513%Dividend yield0%Volatility  option life625 yearsFor stock-based awards included in the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model, the Company used historical stock price information of certain peer group companies for a period of time equal to the expected award life period to determine estimated volatility. The Company determined the expected life of the stock awards by averaging the contractual life of the awards and the vesting period of the awards. The estimated fair value of awards are amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the awards vesting period.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles--Goodwill and Other Topic 350: Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. This ASU states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This allows for the same evaluation as described in ASU 2011-08 for IntangiblesGoodwill and Other. The amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before July 27, 2012, if a public entity financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or, for nonpublic entities, have not yet been made available for issuance. ASU 2012-02 is not expected to significantly impact the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows123Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedIn September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other Topic 350: Testing Goodwill for Impairment ASU 2011-08. ASU 2011-08 is intended to simplify how entities, both public and nonpublic, test goodwill for impairment. ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50%. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entitys financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or, for nonpublic entities, have not yet been made available for issuance. ASU 2011-08 is not expected to significantly impact the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In July 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-07, Health Care Entities Topic 954: Presentation and Disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities ASU 2011-07. ASU 2011-07 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2011, with early adoption permitted. Changes to the presentation of the provision for bad debts related to patient service revenue in the statement of operations should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. ASU 2011-07 states that a healthcare entity that recognizes significant amounts of patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered even though it does not assess the patients ability to pay must present the allowance for doubtful accounts as a reduction of net patient revenue and not include it as a separate item in operating expenses. The Company early adopted this guidance effective July 1, 2011. In July 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-06, Other Expenses Topic 720: Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Health Insurers a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, or ASU 2011-06.ASU 2011-06 addresses how fees mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 collectively, the Health Reform Law, should be recognized and classified in the income statements of health insurers. The Health Reform Law imposes a mandatory annual fee on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after January1, 2014. ASU 2011-06 stipulates that the liability incurred for that fee be amortized to expense over the calendar year in which it is payable. This ASU is effective for calendar years beginning after December31, 2013, when the fee initially becomes effective.The adoption of ASU 2011-06 is not expected to significantly impact the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income Topic 220: Presentation of ComprehensiveIncome, ASU 2011-05 which requires that all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The guidance provided in this ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and retrospectively for all periods presented, the Company early adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-5. ASU 2011-5 eliminated the Companys previously elected option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. Instead, ASU 2011-5 requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The Company has elected to present comprehensive income with the inclusion of a separate and consecutive statement. The adoption of this standard by the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 did not have any impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In August 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-23, Health Care Entities Topic 954: Measuring Charity Care for Disclosure ASU 2010-23. Due to the lack of comparability that previously existed due to the use of either revenue or cost as the basis for disclosure of charity care, ASU 2010-23 standardizes cost as the basis for charity care disclosures and specifies the elements of cost to be used in charity care disclosures. The Company adopted ASU 2010-23 on July 1, 2011. 3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONSAcquisition of The Detroit Medical CenterEffective January1, 2011, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of DMC, a Michigan non-profit corporation, and certain of its affiliates, which assets consisted of eightacute care and specialty hospitals and related healthcare facilities in the Detroit, Michigan metropolitan area. The table below summarizes the DMC purchase price allocation. 124Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedCash$64Accounts  expenses and other current assets1060Property and  intangible assets107Investments in securities1664Other assets852Total assets acquired1,1428Accounts payable809Other current liabilities1883Pension benefit obligation2280Other long-term liabilities2823Total liabilities and equity assumed7795Net assets acquired$3633Acquisition of Valley BaptistEffective September1, 2011,the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Valley Baptist Medical Center, a 586-bed acute care hospital in Harlingen, Texas, and Valley Baptist Medical CenterBrownsville, a 280-bed acute care hospital in Brownsville, Texas, as well as the assets of certain other incidental healthcare businesses, partnerships, physician practices and medical office buildings operated as part of such hospital businesses collectively Valley Baptist. The Company paid approximately $2005 millionin cash at closing to acquire the net assets of Valley Baptist. In addition to the cash investment, the Company also assumed certain of the sellers debt and issued a 49%non-controlling interest in the partnership to the seller. The Company funded the cash investment with cash on hand. The Valley Baptist partnership is consolidated by the Company. In connection with this acquisition, the Company entered into a management agreement, pursuant to which the Company is responsible for the management of Valley Baptists operations.The RNCI resulted from an option the seller was granted as part of the acquisition to require the Company to redeem all or a portion of the seller 49% equity interest in the partnership on the third or fifth anniversary of the acquisition date at a stated redemption value. The carrying value of the redeemable non-controlling interest has been determined based upon the discounted expected redemption value as of June 30, 2012. Each reporting period the Company accretes the carrying value of RNCI up to the expected redemption value during the three years subsequent to acquisition. If the minority partner exercises this option, the Company may purchase the non-controlling interest with cash or by issuing stock. If the option is exercised, it is the Companys intent to settle the purchase in cash. If the option were to be settled in shares, approximately 8,129,000shares of the Companys common stock would be required to be issued based upon the closing price of the Companys common stock on June29, 2012. Any excess of the purchase price allocation over the fair values of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests is recorded as goodwill. The Company had completed its fair value estimates of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the acquisition as of June30, 2012.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe Companys financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to investments in available-for-sale securities held by two of its captive insurance subsidiaries. The following tables present information about the assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June30, 2011and 2012in millions. The following tables also indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the Company utilized to determine such fair values. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices unadjustedin active markets for identical assets. The Company considers a security that trades at least weekly to have an active market. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset. The Companys policy is to recognize transfers between levels as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer126Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedJune30, 2012Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical AssetsLevel   3United States short-term treasury bills$210$01$209$Corporate bonds126126Common stock domestic10101100Common stock  stock  in  2011Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical AssetsLevel   3United States short-term treasury bills$208$03$205$Auction rate securities8888Corporate bonds141141Common stock domestic970196Common stock  stock  in  following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the year ended June30, 2012and the year ended June30, 2011for those fair value measurements using significant Level 3 unobservable inputs for the Company investment in auction rate securities ARS included within investments in securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in millions.Balance at June 30, 2011RedemptionsRealized gainon redemptions, pre taxChange infair value,pre taxBalance at June 30, 2012Auction rate  at June 30, 2010RedemptionsRealized gainon redemptions, pre taxChange infair value,pre taxBalance at June 30, 2011Auction rate  in securitiesAs of June30, 2012, the Company held $518 millionin total available for sale investments in debt and equity securities, which are included in investments in securities on the consolidated balance sheets.

The discount rate was decreased from 557%at June 30, 2011 to 440%at June30, 2012.To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the DMC Pension Plan considers the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. The DMC Pension Plans weighted-average asset allocations by asset category as of June30, 2012, were as follows:TargetActualAsset category:Cash and cash equivalents0%1%Equity securities56%64%Debt securities25%14%Alternatives and other19%21%The DMC Pension Plan assets are invested in separately managed portfolios using investment management firms. The DMC Pension Plans objective for all asset categories is to maximize total return without assuming undue risk exposure. The DMC Pension Plan maintains a well-diversified asset allocation that best meets these objectives. The DMC Pension Plan assets are largely comprised of equity securities, which include companies with various market capitalization sizes in addition to international and convertible securities. Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds. Debt securities include domestic and foreign government obligations, corporate bonds, and mortgage backed securities. Alternative investments include investments in limited partnerships. Under the investment policy of the DMC Pension Plan, investments in derivative securities are not permitted for the sole purpose of speculating on the direction of market interest rates. Included in this prohibition are leveraging, shorting, swaps, futures, options, forwards, and similar strategies.In each investment account, investment managers are responsible to monitor and react to economic indicators, such as GDP, CPI and the Federal Monetary Policy, that may affect the performance of their account. The performance of all managers and the aggregate asset allocation are formally reviewed on a quarterly basis, with a rebalancing of the asset allocation occurring at least once a year. The current asset allocation objective is to maintain a certain percentage with each class allowing for a 10%deviation from the target.The following table summarizes the plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June30, 2012, the most recent measurement date, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements are determined as disclosed in Note 4. Fair value methodologies for Level 1 and Level 2 are consistent with the inputs described in Note 4. Fair value for Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset149Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedJune30, 2012Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical AssetsLevel   3Cash and cash equivalents$106$106$$United States government obligations587587Foreign obligations0101Asset and mortgage-backed securities220220Corporate bonds341341Equity   expected future employer contributions, which represent amounts required to be paid by laws and regulation to the plan trust, are approximately $504 millionfor the Companys fiscal year ending June30, 2013.

The federal and state NOL carryforwards expire from 2020 to 2029 and 2013 to 2030, respectively. Approximately $1250 millionof state NOL carryforwards expired as of June 30, 2012 resulting in a deferred tax and valuation allowance impact of $67 million. Approximately $16 millionof these NOLs are subject to annual limitations for federal purposes. These limitations are not expected to significantly affect the Companys ability to ultimately recognize the benefit of these NOLs in future years.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe table below summarizes the total changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2011and 2012in millions.Balance at June30, 2009$50Additions based on tax positions related to the current year08Additions for tax positions of prior years61Reductions for tax positions of prior yearsSettlementsBalance at June30, 2010119Additions based on tax positions related to the current year09Additions for tax positions of prior years07Reductions for tax positions of prior years03SettlementsBalance at June30, 2011132Additions based on tax positions related to the current year61Additions for tax positions of prior years35Reductions for tax positions of prior years131SettlementsBalance at June30, 2012$97Of the $97 milliontotal unrecognized tax benefits, $03 millionof the balance as of June30, 2012of unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.The provisions of the guidance for uncertain tax positions allow for the classification of interest on an underpayment of income taxes, when the tax law required interest to be paid, and penalties, when a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties, in income taxes, interest expense or another appropriate expense classification based on the accounting policy election of the company. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. During the year ended 2012, the Company recognized approximately $5,000, respectively, of such interest and penalties. The Company did not recognize any interest and penalties relative to uncertain tax positions during the year ended June30, 2010 or 2011.In the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Company recorded a $49 milliondeferred tax benefit from the application of the recently enacted Michigan Corporate Income Tax to future taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Michigan Corporate Income Tax was enacted on May 25, 2011 and was effective January 1, 2012 for companies that elected to be subject to the new corporate income as opposed to continuing to be taxed under the Michigan Business Tax. The Company elected, during the fourth fiscal quarter, to be subject to the Michigan Corporate Income Tax on its Michigan tax return for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. The Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for tax years 2005 and beyond remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service152Table of Contents10.

As of June30, 2012, the Company had spent approximately $1603 millionrelated to this commitment, including approximately $742 millionrelated to the specific project list. Under the terms of the DMC acquisition agreement, the Company was required to spend at least $800 millionrelated to the specific list of expansion projects through December31, 2011. Since this commitment was not met, the Company deposited $418 millionof cash into an escrow account restricted for the purpose of funding capital expenditures related to the specific project list until the escrow is depleted. The cash escrow funds will be utilized to fund DMC capital expenditures on the specific project list incurred subsequent to January1, 2012. Since funding the escrow, the Company had drawn approximately $215 millionfrom the account for reimbursement of capital expenditures related to the specific project list through June30, 2012. As of June30, 2012, the Company estimated its remaining commitments, excluding those for DMC, to complete all capital projects in process to be approximately $1121 million.Governmental RegulationICD MatterIn September 2010 the Company received a letter, which was signed jointly by an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of Florida and an attorney from the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ Civil Division, stating that, among other things, 1 the DOJ is conducting an investigation to determine whether or not certain hospitals have submitted claims for payment for the implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillators ICDs which were not medically indicated and/or otherwise violated Medicare payment policy; 2 the investigation covers the time period commencing with Medicares expansion of coverage of ICDs in 2003 through the present; 3 the relevant CMS National Coverage Determination excludes Medicare coverage for ICDs implanted for primary prevention in patients who have had an acute myocardial infarction within the past 40 daysor an angioplasty or bypass surgery within the past three months; 4 DOJs initial analysis of claims submitted to Medicare indicates that many of the Company hospitals may have submitted claims for ICDs and related services that were excluded from coverage; 5 the DOJs review is preliminary, but continuing, and it may include medical review of patient 157Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedcharts and other documents, along with statements under oath; and 6 the Company and its hospitals should ensure the retention and preservation of all information, electronic or otherwise, pertaining or related to ICDs. Upon receipt of this letter, the Company immediately took steps to retain and preserve all of the Company information and that of its hospitals related to ICDs.Published sources report that earlier in 2010 the DOJ served subpoenas on a number of hospitals and health systems for this same ICD Medicare billing issue, but that the DOJ appears later in 2010 to have changed its approach, in that hospitals and health systems have since September2010 received letters regarding ICDs substantially in the form of the letter that the Company received, rather than subpoenas. DMC received its letter from DOJ in respect of ICDs in December 2010. The Company understands that the DOJ is investigating hundreds of other hospitals, in addition to its hospitals, for ICD billings, as part of a national enforcement initiative.The Company has entered into tolling agreements with the DOJ. In addition, the DOJ has advised us that the investigation covers implantations after October 1, 2003, has identified the cases that are the subject of the DOJs investigation, and has requested that the Company review the identified cases. The Company understands that the DOJ has made similar requests for self-reviews of the other health systems and hospitals under investigation. The Company understands that the DOJ is finalizing a set of auditing instructions that it will be issuing to all the hospitals, nationally, that are being investigated. The Company further understands that the DOJ will request that hospitals audit the cases previously identified by the DOJ in accordance with those instructions, and that the DOJ intends to pursue settlement negotiations based on the results of the audit.The Company intends to cooperate fully with the investigation of this matter. To date, the DOJ has not asserted any specific claim of damages against the Company or its hospitals. Because the Company still is in the early stages of this investigation, the Company is unable to predict its timing or outcome at this time. However, as the Company understands that this investigation is being conducted under the federal False Claims Act FCA, the Company is at risk for significant damages under the FCAs treble damages and civil monetary penalty provisions if the DOJ concludes a large percentage of claims for the identified patients are false claims and, as a result, such damages could materially affect the Company business, financial condition or results of operations.OIG Subpoena: Physician Compensation Arrangements in ArizonaOn March 16, 2012, the Company received a subpoena from the Office of Investigations of the Office of the Inspector General OIG requesting documents related to the fair market value of compensation paid by VHS Outpatient Clinics, Inc. or its affiliates to fivephysicians. The Company provided the records requested by the OIG. The OIG did not assert any specific claims of damages against the Company. On June 7, 2012, the OIG notified the Company that its investigation had concluded and was closed.The Company believes that this OIG investigation may have been related to a pending civil action that was filed under seal on December 15, 2011 with the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. On June 21, 2012 the U.S. Government filed a Notice of Election to Decline Intervention in that matter, as described below. The Company believes that all of the allegations described are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this action, if pursued.

In the complaint, plaintiffs allege that the threehospital system defendants conspired with each other and with other unidentified San Antonio area hospitals to depress the compensation levels of registered nurses employed at the conspiring hospitals within the San Antonio area by engaging in certain activities that violated the federal antitrust laws. The complaint alleges twoseparate claims. The first count asserts that the defendant hospitals violated Section 1 of the federal Sherman Act, which prohibits agreements that unreasonably restrain competition, by conspiring to depress nurses' compensation. The second count alleges that the defendant hospital systems also violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by participating in wage, salary and benefits surveys for the purpose, and having the effect, of depressing registered nurses' compensation or limiting competition for nurses based on their compensation. The class on whose behalf the plaintiffs filed the complaint is alleged to comprise all registered nurses employed by the defendant hospitals since June 20, 2002. The suit seeks unspecified damages, trebling of this damage amount pursuant to federal law, interest, costs and attorneys' fees. From 2006 through April 2008 the Company and the plaintiffs worked on producing documents to each other relating to, and supplying legal briefs to the court in respect of, solely the issue of whether the court will certify a class in this suit, the court having bifurcated the class and merit issues. In April 2008 the case was stayed by the judge pending his ruling on plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The Company believes that the allegations contained within this putative class action suit are without merit, and the Company has vigorously worked to defeat class certification. If a class is certified, the Company will continue to defend vigorously against the litigation.On the same date in 2006 that this suit was filed against the Company in federal district court in San Antonio, the same attorneys filed threeother substantially similar putative class action lawsuits in federal district courts in Chicago, Illinois, Albany, New York and Memphis, Tennessee against some of the hospitals or hospital systems in those cities none of such hospitals or hospital systems being owned by the Company. The attorneys representing the plaintiffs in all fourof these cases said in June 2006 that they may file similar complaints in other jurisdictions and in December 2006 they brought a substantially similar class action lawsuit against eighthospitals or hospital systems in the Detroit, Michigan metropolitan area, one of which systems was DMC. Since representatives of the Service Employees International Union SEIU joined plaintiffs' attorneys in announcing the filing of all four complaints on June 20, 2006, and as has been reported in the media, the Company believes that SEIU involvement in these actions appears to be part of a corporate campaign to attempt to organize nurses in these cities, including San Antonio and Detroit. The registered nurses in the Company hospitals in San Antonio and Detroit are currently not members of any union. In the suit in Detroit against DMC, the court did not bifurcate class and merits issues. On March 22,2012, the judge issued an opinion and order granting in part and denying in part the defendants' motions for summary judgment. The defendants' motions were granted as to the count of the complaint alleging wage fixing by defendants, but were denied as to the count alleging that the defendants' sharing of wage information allegedly resulted in the suppression of nurse wages. The opinion, however, did not address plaintiffs' motion for class certification and did not address defendants' challenge to the opinion of plaintiffs' expert, but specifically reserved ruling on those matters for a later date.If the plaintiffs in the San Antonio and/or Detroit suits 1 are successful in obtaining class certification and 2 are able to prove both liability and substantial damages, which are then trebled under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, such a result could materially affect the Company business, financial condition or results of operations. However, in the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or results of operations.ReimbursementFinal determination of amounts earned under prospective payment and cost-reimbursement activities is subject to review by appropriate governmental authorities or their agents. In the opinion of the Companys management, adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from such reviews.Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs are complex and subject to interpretation. The Companys management believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in all material respects and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing related to Medicare and Medicaid programs. While no such regulatory inquiries have been made, the Companys compliance with such laws and regulations is subject to future government review and interpretation. Non-compliance with 159Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continuedsuch laws and regulations could result in significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.AcquisitionsThe Company has acquired and expects to continue to acquire businesses with prior operating histories. Acquired companies may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, such as billing and reimbursement, fraud and abuse and similar anti-referral laws. Although the Company institutes policies designed to conform practices to its standards following the completion of its acquisitions, there can be no assurance that it will not become liable for past activities of prior owners that may later be asserted to be improper by private plaintiffs or government agencies. Although the Company generally seeks to obtain indemnification from prospective sellers covering such matters, there can be no assurance that any such matter will be covered by indemnification, or if covered, that such indemnification will be adequate to cover potential losses and fines.Employment-Related AgreementsEffective June1, 1998, the Company executed employment agreements with threeof its current senior executive officers. The Company executed an employment agreement with a fourth current senior executive officer on September1, 1999. The employment agreements were amended on September23, 2004 to extend the term of each employment agreement another 5years and to provide that the Blackstone merger did not constitute a change of control, as defined in the agreements. From November15, 2007 to December31, 2008, the Company entered into written employment agreements with fourother executive officers for terms expiring five years from the agreement date. The employment agreements will renew automatically for additional one-year periods, unless terminated by the Company or the executive officer. The employment agreements provide, among other things, for minimum salary levels, for participation in bonus plans, and for amounts to be paid as liquidated damages in the event of a change in control or termination by the Company without cause.The Company has executed severance protection agreements severance agreements between the Company and each of its other officers who do not have employment agreements. The severance agreements are automatically extended for successive one year terms at the discretion of the Company unless a change in control occurs, as defined in the severance agreement, at which time the severance agreement continues in effect for a period of not less than three years beyond the date of such event. The Company may be obligated to pay severance payments as set forth in the severance agreements in the event of a change in control and the termination of the executives employment of the Company.GuaranteesPhysician GuaranteesIn the normal course of its business, the Company enters into physician relocation agreements under which it guarantees minimum monthly income, revenues or collections or guarantees reimbursement of expenses up to maximum limits to physicians during a specified period of time typically, 12months to 24months. In return for the guarantee payments, the physicians are required to practice in the community for a stated period of time typically, 3 to 4years or else return the guarantee payments to the Company. The Company records a liability and offsetting intangible asset at estimated fair value for all guarantees by calculating an estimate of expected payments to be made over the guarantee period. The Company reduces the liability as it makes guarantee payments and amortizes the intangible asset over the term of the physicians relocation agreements. The Company also estimates the fair value of liabilities and offsetting intangible assets related to payment guarantees for physician service agreements for which no repayment provisions exist. As of June30, 2012, the Company had a net intangible asset of $74 millionand a remaining liability of $53 millionrelated to these physician income and service guarantees. The maximum amount of the Companys unpaid physician income and service guarantees as of June30, 2012was approximately $60 million.Other GuaranteesAs part of its contract with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, one of the Companys health plans, PHP, is required to maintain a performance guarantee, the amount of which is based upon PHPs membership and capitation premiums received. As of June30, 2012, the Company maintained this performance guarantee in the form of $450 millionof surety bonds with independent third party insurers collateralized by letters of credit of approximately $50 million. The Company also has a surety bond for its Michigan Pioneer ACO in the amount of $30 millionas part of the requirements set forth by CMS. The Company also holds other miscellaneous surety bonds for various corporate needs160Table of ContentsVANGUARD HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued17. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSPursuant to the Blackstone merger agreement, the Company entered into a transaction and monitoring fee agreement with Blackstone and Metalmark Subadvisor LLC Metalmark SA, which is an affiliate of Metalmark Capital LLC, which has shared voting or investment power in Holdings units owned by the MSCP Funds. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company agreed to pay Blackstone an annual monitoring fee of $40 millionand to pay Metalmark SA an annual monitoring fee of $12 millionfor the first five years and $06 millionannually thereafter plus out of pocket expenses. The monitoring fee represents compensation to Blackstone and Metalmark SA for their advisory and consulting services with respect to financing transactions, strategic decisions, dispositions or acquisitions of assets and other Company affairs from time to time. During fiscal 2010, the Company paid $44 millionand $07 millionin monitoring fees and expenses to Blackstone and Metalmark SA, respectively. During fiscal 2011, the Company paid $43 millionand $06 millionin monitoring fees and expenses to Blackstone and Metalmark SA, respectively. In connection with the initial public offering, Blackstone and the Company agreed to amend and terminate the existing transaction and monitoring fee agreement. As a result, the Company accrued approximately $149 millionof monitoring fees and expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, $130 millionpayable to Blackstone and $19 millionpayable to Metalmark SA, which is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at June30, 2011. During fiscal 2012, the Company paid $40 millionand $06 millionof the outstanding accrued monitoring fees and expenses to Blackstone and Metalmark SA, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, approximately $90 millionand $13 millionremain payable to Blackstone and Metalmark SA, respectively, and is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The quarterly payments are due beginning July1, 2011 and ending July1, 2014 unless Blackstone elects at any time to accelerate the aforementioned quarterly payments to it and Metalmark SA to a lump sum payable due immediately. Under the transaction and monitoring fee agreement, Blackstone and Metalmark SA are entitled to receive additional compensation for providing investment banking or other financial advisory services to the Company by mutual agreement among Blackstone, Metalmark SA and the Company. In this regard, in May2011, the Company agreed to pay financial advisory fees to Blackstone and Metalmark SA of $100 millionand $15 million, respectively, to reflect their contributions to the Companys accomplishments during fiscal year 2011.Blackstone and Metalmark SA have the ability to control the Companys policies and operations, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with the Companys interests. The Company also conducts business with other entities controlled by Blackstone or Metalmark SA. The Companys results of operations could be materially different as a result of Blackstone and Metalmark SAs control than such results would be if the Company were autonomous.A summary of the monitoring fees and expenses incurred by the Company for the year ended June30, 2011 is as follows:Metalmark  monitoring fees and  of transaction and monitoring fees due under transaction and monitoring fee agreement19130149Financial advisory services fee15100115Total monitoring fees and expenses for the year ended June30, 2011$40$273$313Effective July1, 2008, the Company entered into an Employer Health Program Agreement with Equity Healthcare LLC Equity Healthcare, which is an affiliate of Blackstone.

Controls and Procedures.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, our management conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe completed the acquisition of Valley Baptist effective September 1, 2011. The facilities acquired as part of the Valley Baptist acquisition utilize different information technology systems than our other facilities. We have excluded all of the Valley Baptist operations from our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The SEC rules require us to include acquired entities in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting no later than the annual management report following the first anniversary of the acquisition. We will complete the evaluation and integration of the Valley Baptist operations within the required time frame and report management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, including the acquired hospitals and other operations, in our first annual report in which such assessment is required. Other than the Valley Baptist acquisition, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Management report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth on page 169 and is incorporated herein by reference. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this report has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as set forth on page 170 herein167Table of ContentsManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. Our internal control system was designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and with the participation of management in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and our preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.All internal control systems, no matter how well designed and tested, have inherent limitations, including, among other things, the possibility of human error, circumvention or disregard. Therefore, even those systems of internal control that have been determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Under the supervision of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and with the participation of management, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on an assessment of such criteria, management concluded that, as of June 30, 2012, we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.As more fully described under the heading Business Combinations in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8, we acquired Valley Baptist Health System VBHS on September1, 2011. We excluded VBHS from our fiscal 2012 assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. VBHS accounted for approximately $3736 million of our total assets, $901 million of net assets and $3583 million of our total revenues during the year ended June 30, 2012. We expect that our internal control system will be fully implemented at VBHS during fiscal 2013 and correspondingly evaluated by us for effectiveness.An assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012 has been performed by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.

Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.As indicated in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Valley Baptist Health System VBHS, the financial results of which is included in the June 30, 2012 consolidated financial statements of Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. and constituted $3736 million of total assets, $901 million of net assets, $3583 million of total revenues and $90 million of net loss, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2012. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of VBHS.In our opinion, Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. as of June 30, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income loss, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2012 of Vanguard Health Systems, Inc. and our report dated August23, 2012expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst Young LLPNashville, TennesseeAugust23, 2012169Table of ContentsItem1.
