MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of The Dial Corporation has the responsibility for preparing
and assuring the integrity and objectivity of the accompanying financial
statements and other financial information in this report. The financial
statements were prepared using generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. The financial statements reflect, where applicable,
management best estimates and judgments and include disclosures and
explanations that are relevant to an understanding of the financial affairs of
the Company.
The Company financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche
LLP. Management has made available to Deloitte & Touche LLP all of the Company
financial records and other relevant data and has made appropriate and complete
written and oral representations and disclosures in connection with the audit.
Management has established and maintains a system of internal control that
is designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are authorized and
properly recorded, that assets are protected and that materially inaccurate
financial reporting is prevented and detected. The appropriate segregation of
responsibilities and careful selection of employees are components of the system
of internal controls. The internal control system is independently monitored and
evaluated by an extensive and comprehensive internal auditing program.
The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee, oversees the
adequacy of the Company internal control environment. The Audit Committee
meets regularly with management representatives and, jointly and separately,
with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and internal auditing management
to review accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of The Dial Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Dial
Corporation as of December 31, 1998, and January 3, 1998, and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, cash flows and
stockholders' equity for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of The Dial Corporation as of
December 31, 1998, and January 3, 1998, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December
31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, JANUARY 3, 1998
AND DECEMBER 28, 1996
NOTE A. BASIS OF PREPARATION
On July 25, 1996, the Board of Directors of The Dial Corp Former Parent
declared a dividend to effect the spin-off of its Consumer Products Business
the Spin-off. The dividend was paid on August 15, 1996, to shareholders of
record as of August 5, 1996. Each Dial shareholder received a dividend of one
share of common stock of The Dial Corporation the Company, which, since the
Spin-off, has owned and operated the Consumer Products Business previously
conducted by Former Parent. Concurrently with the Spin-off, the name of Former
Parent was changed to Viad Corp.
The Consolidated Financial Statements present the financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of the divisions and subsidiaries
comprising the Company, as if it had been formed as a separate entity for all
periods presented. Dial historical cost basis of the assets and liabilities
have been carried over to the new company. Concurrent with the Spin-off, the
Company was capitalized through settlement of Former Parent investment and
advances account of $5174 million by the assumption of $280 million of
long-term debt and $802 million net of income taxes in Armour employee
benefit liabilities, with the net $1572 million remaining comprising the
Company stockholders' equity as of the Spin-off date. All intercompany
balances and transactions among the entities comprising the Company have been
eliminated.
NOTE B. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Beginning with 1998, the Company fiscal year end is December 31. Prior to
1998, the Company fiscal year ended on the Saturday closest to the end of
December. Fiscal year 1998 consisted of 52 weeks, fiscal year 1997 consisted of
53 weeks and fiscal year 1996 consisted of 52 weeks.
Revenue Recognition. Sales are recorded at the time products are shipped
to trade customers.
Major Customers. Major customers are defined as those that individually
accounted for more than 10% of the Company sales. Sales to a major customer
accounted for 17%, 17% and 16% of the Company net sales in 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively.
Marketing and Research and Development Costs. All expenditures for
marketing and research and development are charged against earnings in the year
incurred and are reported in the Statement of Consolidated Operations under the
caption Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company internal
and external research and development expenditures totaled approximately $102
million, $98 million and $152 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Marketing costs include the costs of advertising and various sales promotional
programs.
Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents.
Inventories. Generally, inventories are stated at the lower of cost first
in, first out and average cost methods or market.
Long-Lived Assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 121, the Company reviews the carrying values of its
long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles for possible impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets
to be held and used may not be recoverable. For assets to be disposed of, the
Company reports long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

31
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, JANUARY 3, 1998
AND DECEMBER 28, 1996
Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided principally by use of the straight-line method at
annual rates as follows:
2% to 5%
Machinery and other equipment. 5% to 33%
Leasehold  Lesser of lease term or useful life
Intangibles. Intangibles are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization. Intangibles that arose prior to November 1, 1970, as a result of
the Former Parent initial investment in the Company are not being amortized.
Goodwill arising on or after November 1, 1970, is amortized on the straight-line
method over the periods of expected benefit but not in excess of 40 years.
Trademarks are amortized on the straight-line method over 40 years. The customer
list that arose from the acquisition of PUREXR is being amortized over 30
years.
Pension and Other Benefits. Trusteed, noncontributory pension plans cover
substantially all employees, with benefit levels supplemented in most cases by
defined matching common stock contributions to employees' 401k plans. Defined
benefits are based primarily on final average salary and years of service.
Funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall
be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations.
The Company has defined benefit post retirement plans that provide medical
and life insurance for eligible retirees and dependents. The related post
retirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are
provided by employees.
Net Income Per Common Share. In accordance with SFAS No. 128, basic net
income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year before giving effect
to stock options considered to be dilutive common stock equivalents. Diluted net
income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year after giving effect
to stock options considered to be dilutive common stock equivalents. Shares held
by the Employee Equity Trust the Trust are not considered outstanding for
net income per share calculations until the shares are released from the Trust.
At December 31, 1998, there were 104,355,018 shares of common stock issued
and 98,683,200 shares outstanding. At December 31, 1998, and January 3, 1998, a
total of 4,495,736 and 5,072,785, respectively, of the issued shares were held
by the Trust. At December 31, 1998, and January 3, 1998, a total of 1,176,082
and 101,040 shares of common stock, respectively, were held in treasury by the
Company. The shares held at December 31, 1998, included 218,725 shares valued at
$52 million purchased by the Company as part of a small shareholder
selling/repurchasing program executed during the first half of 1998 and 831,600
shares valued at $211 million as part of the Company stock repurchase
program.
In addition to common stock, the Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value of $01 per share, none of which has been
issued.
Income per share is presented for 1996 as the Company common shares were
issued on August 15, 1996. The calculation of income per share assumes that the
common shares and common share equivalents were outstanding for that entire
year.
Reporting on Comprehensive Income. In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 Reporting Comprehensive Income
SFAS No. 130 which was adopted in 1998. SFAS No. 130 requires that
enterprises classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a
financial statement and display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive
income separately from retained income and additional capital in the
stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.

AND DECEMBER 28, 1996
Segments of an Enterprise. In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information SFAS No. 131 which was adopted in 1998.
SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for the way that public enterprises report
information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires
that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in
interim financial reports issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards
for disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major
customers. See Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information concerning the Company segments of an enterprise disclosures.
New Accounting Pronouncements. In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 requires all derivatives
to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and provides a comprehensive
and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and
hedging activities. The Company is studying the application of this new
Statement. This Statement shall be effective for annual periods beginning after

On July 1, 1998, the Company acquired The Freeman Cosmetic Corporation
Freeman, a manufacturer and marketer of natural skin care, hair care, bath,
body and foot care products for a cash purchase price of approximately $780
million. The cash purchase price for Freeman reflects a $60 million reduction
as a result of a net worth adjustment received by the Company in January 1999.
The Freeman acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. The purchase price has been preliminary allocated based on estimated
fair value of assets and liabilities at date of acquisition, pending final
determination of certain acquired balances. This preliminary allocation added
$77 million to current assets, $196 million to current liabilities and has
resulted in acquired goodwill of $875 million, which is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 40 years. The results of Freeman have been included in
the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.
On September 14, 1998, the Company acquired Sarah Michaels, Inc. Sarah
Michaels, a manufacturer and marketer of specialty bath and body care products
for a cash purchase price of $1870 million. The Sarah Michaels acquisition has
been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price
has been preliminary allocated based on estimated fair value of assets and
liabilities at date of acquisition, pending final determination of certain
acquired balances. At December 31, 1998, $50 million remains in escrow pending
final valuation of certain acquired assets and liabilities. This preliminary
allocation added $439 million to current assets, $161 million to current
liabilities and has resulted in acquired goodwill of approximately $1258
million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. The
results of Sarah Michaels have been included in the consolidated financial
statements since the acquisition date.
The Company continues to gather and analyze certain information required to
complete the allocation of the purchase price of the acquisitions of Freeman and
Sarah Michaels. Further adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price may
arise as a result of the finalization of the ongoing study.
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information
for 1998 and 1997 includes the results of operations for the Company and assumes
the acquisition of Sarah Michaels and Freeman were consummated at the beginning
of each period presented, along with adjustments which give effect to events
that are directly attributable to the transaction and are expected to have a
continuing impact. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
information does not give any effect to any potential cost savings which may
arise from the consolidation of the acquisitions with the Company.

occurred. In addition, in November 1997, the Company acquired three leading
personal care soap brands and two laundry bar brands from The Procter & Gamble
Company Argentinean subsidiary for a purchase price of $48 million paid in
cash. These acquisitions, accounted for under the purchase method of accounting,

NOTE D. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND INVENTORY AND ASSET WRITE-DOWNS
In the third quarter of 1996, the Company announced a line of business and

December 1997, required the Company to pay a fixed rate of 887% and receive a
six-month LIBOR rate.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying values of cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and bank borrowings approximate fair
values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
NOTE O. STOCK OPTIONS
Certain officers and employees hold options to acquire the Company common
stock, which were granted under Former Parent stock option plans. These
options were granted over a period of nine years and have been adjusted for
stock splits and the Spin-off. Such options were transferred to the Company as
part of the Spin-off, with the number of shares and option prices adjusted so as
to preserve the economic value of the options to the optionees. Such options
were granted at the market prices on the dates of grant, became exercisable 50%
after one year and 100% after two years and expire after 10 years. No additional
options will be granted under these plans.
In connection with the Spin-off, the Company adopted The Dial Corporation
Stock Incentive Plan 1996 Plan which is administered by the Executive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Under the 1996 Plan, the
aggregate number of shares of common and preferred stock covered by awards to
any one individual cannot exceed 1,000,000 shares for any three-year period
plus shares necessary to replace options granted by the Former Parent and
transferred to the Company in connection with the Spin-off, and no more than
9,600,000 shares are cumulatively available for options intended to qualify as
incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code. The term of the
options is 10 years. The Plan provides that options are generally to be granted
at the market price on the date of grant; however, the Executive Compensation
Committee may grant options at less than such market price. The 1996 Plan also
authorizes the issuance of stock appreciation rights and restricted stock.
Under the 1996 Plan, incentive stock options to purchase 232,490 shares and
non qualified options to purchase 55,916 shares were granted at the market price
on the dates of grant during 1998. After one year, one-third of the options
become exercisable when the average closing market price over 20 consecutive
days equals or exceeds 133% of the option price, two-thirds when such price
equals or exceeds 167% of the option price and 100% when such price equals or
exceeds 200% of the option price. All such options become exercisable, in any
event, after five years from the date of grant. It is expected that additional
options will not be granted prior to August 1999.
During 1998, options to purchase 39,100 shares also were granted to non
employee members of the Board of Directors at the market prices on the dates of
grant. Such options are exercisable 50% after one year and 100% after two years.
The options expire after 10 years.

NOTE R. LITIGATION AND CLAIMS
The Company is party to various legal actions, proceedings and pending

other damages in material amounts. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties,
and it is possible that some of the legal actions, proceedings and claims
referred to above

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, JANUARY 3, 1998
AND DECEMBER 28, 1996
could be decided against the Company. Although the amount of liability at
December 31, 1998, with respect to these matters is not ascertainable, the
Company believes that any resulting liability will not materially affect the
Company financial position or results of operations.
The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations of the
United States, as well as states and other countries in whose jurisdictions the
Company has or had operations and is subject to certain international
agreements. As is the case with many companies, the Company faces exposure to
actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters.
Although the Company is party to certain environmental disputes, the Company
believes that any liabilities resulting therefrom, after taking into
consideration amounts already provided for, but exclusive of, any potential
insurance recoveries, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations. As of December 31, 1998, the
Company had accrued in its financial statements approximately $3 million in
reserves for expenses related to Superfund and clean-up of closed plant sites.
