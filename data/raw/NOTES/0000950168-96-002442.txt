ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Wandel & Goltermann Technologies, Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wandel
& Goltermann Technologies, Inc. a North Carolina corporation and subsidiaries
as of September 30, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of
income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended September 30, 1996. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wandel & Goltermann
Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1996 and 1995, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.                             /s/ Arthur Andersen LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Wandel & Goltermann Technologies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
which are referred to collectively herein as the Company.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The Company develops, manufactures, markets and supports test,
measurement, diagnostic and monitoring products for local and wide area data and
telecommunication networks. The Company also markets specialized test,
measurement and monitoring instruments primarily for use by operators of
telecommunication and data transmission systems.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wandel &
Goltermann Technologies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers short-term investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
REVENUES
The Company recognizes product revenues at the time of shipment to
nonaffiliated and affiliated customers. Service revenues are recognized as
services are performed. Maintenance contract revenues, including revenues
related to extended warranty contracts, are deferred and recognized over the
contract term. The Company accrues related product return reserves and warranty
expenses at the time of sale.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS, CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND EXPORT SALES
Sales to affiliates accounted for approximately 44% of total revenues
in 1996, 48% in 1995 and 46% in 1994. The Company had accounts receivable from
affiliates of $5,068,000 at September 30, 1996, and $3,934,000 at September 30,
1995. Management believes that all amounts due from affiliates are fully
collectible. No nonaffiliated customer accounted for 10% or more of total
revenues in 1996, 1995 or 1994. In the normal course of business, the Company
extends credit to various nonaffiliated companies, primarily developers and
manufacturers of network systems in the United States. The Company manages its
exposure to credit risk from nonaffiliated customers through credit approval and
monitoring procedures. Further, the Company believes that its portfolio of                    22 receivables from nonaffiliated customers is well diversified and that the
allowance for doubtful accounts $125,000 at September 30, 1996 and $90,000 at
September 30, 1995 is adequate. Accounts receivable are not collateralized.
The Company had export sales, through affiliates, to end users in the
following geographic regions in thousands                                 YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

MARKETABLE SECURITIES
As part of the Company cash management program, the Company invests
in highly liquid preferred stock and municipal bonds. The interest and dividend
rates on these securities are reset on a frequent basis. Under Statement of
Accounting Standards No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities, these securities are classified as available-for-sale
securities. The Company did not hold any such securities at September 30, 1996
or 1995.
PER SHARE DATA
Income per share amounts are computed using the weighted average number
of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding and the dilutive
effects of stock options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, using the
treasury stock method. The primary and fully diluted income per share amounts
are the same for all annual periods presented.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or
market and include material, labor and manufacturing overhead. As of September
30, inventories consist of in thousands                       1996     1995
Raw materials           $1,473    $1,767

Finished goods           2,462    3,443
$4,695    $6,616
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at original cost. Depreciation is
calculated using primarily accelerated methods. Machinery and equipment are
depreciated over three to ten years. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated over
five to seven years.
OTHER ASSETS
Other assets consist primarily of purchased software $453,000 at
September 30, 1996 and $389,000 at September 30, 1995 used in the
administrative operations of the Company or resold or used in conjunction with
the Company products. Such software is being amortized over three to five
years.
23 OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES
As of September 30, other accrued liabilities consist of the following
in thousands                       1996     1995
Deferred revenues       $   485   $  256
Warranty reserve           300     280
Trademark and license fees      33     336
Other                526     598
$1,344    $1,470
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Certain product sales to affiliates, inventory purchases from
affiliates, and other transactions with affiliates are denominated in German
Deutsche Marks DMs and are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
in effect at the transaction date. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the
exchange rate subsequent to the transaction date are reflected in the
consolidated statements of income in the period in which they occur.
From time to time, the Company has sought to reduce its exposure to
increases in the U.S. dollar relative to the DM by purchasing forward foreign
currency exchange contracts and collars relating to cash and accounts receivable
denominated in DMs. In addition, the Company purchases foreign currency exchange
contracts and collars relating to some of its future anticipated sales in DMs.
As of September 30, 1996, the Company has no outstanding forward currency
exchange rate contracts or collars.
Cash and accounts receivable denominated in DM are revalued at each
balance sheet date at the then current exchange rate, and any unrealized gain or
loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Any foreign currency
exchange collars or any contracts are revalued at each balance sheet date at the
then current exchange rate, and any unrealized gain or loss is recognized in the
consolidated statement of income.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
All product development costs, including software development costs,
have been expensed as incurred. The Company anticipates capitalizing eligible
computer software development costs upon the establishment of technological
feasibility, which the Company has defined as completion of a working model.
Through September 30, 1996, such capitalizable costs were insignificant and,
thus, the Company has charged all software development costs to product
development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1995, the Company recorded
restructuring charges of $1,279,000. In September 1995, the Company announced
that it would curtail development and marketing efforts on the Network
Operations product family. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring
charges of $719,000, primarily related to the write-down of inventories and the
expected costs of employee severances. In addition, the Company recorded
severance expenses of $560,000 associated with changes in senior management
which were effective in the quarter ended September 30, 1995.
EFFECTS OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The Company is required to adopt
SFAS 123 for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1996. This statement
establishes accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. Under SFAS
123, the Company may either adopt the new fair value based accounting method or
continue the intrinsic value based method and provide pro forma disclosures of
net 
24 income and earnings per share as if the accounting provisions of this statement
had been adopted. The Company plans to adopt only the disclosure requirements of
SFAS 123; therefore, such adoption will have no effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations.

4. BANK LINE OF CREDIT
In March 1995, the Company entered into a $5,000,000 unsecured line of
credit facility with a U.S. bank. In September 1996, availability under this

the bank to secure the Company group medical insurance plan. There were no
amounts outstanding under this facility during 1996 and 1995. The line, if used,
is payable on January 30, 1998 and bears interest at the lower of the bank
prime rate minus 50% or LIBOR plus 125%. Under the terms of the facility, the
Company has agreed to certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of
stipulated amounts of quick working capital and tangible net worth. As of
September 30, 1996, the Company was in compliance with these financial
covenants.                    25 5. INCOME TAXES
