Controls and Procedures.  Senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation process, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective and that there have
been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Since that evaluation process was completed, there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls.
