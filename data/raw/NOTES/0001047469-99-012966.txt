1  Description of Business
Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc. Sanchez or the Company designs,
develops, markets, implements and supports comprehensive banking software,
called PROFILER, for financial services organizations worldwide.
Sanchez highly flexible PROFILE family of products is comprised of four
integrated modules which operate on open, client-server platforms. The
primary module, called PROFILE/Anyware, is a multi-currency transaction
processing system which supports deposit, loan, customer, and bank
management requirements through multiple distribution channels, including
the Internet. The other modules are PROFILE/FMS, a multi-company,
multi-currency, financial management and accounting system; PROFILE for
Windows, a native WindowsR client application for PROFILE/Anyware
customer service and teller functions; and PROFILE/ODBC, an open
connectivity database driver.
2  Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Management Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to continuously make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses at the date of the financial
statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. The most significant estimate is the
percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generally recognizes product revenue, which includes 
software license fees and product enhancement fees, using the 
percentage-of-completion method over a period of time that commences 
with the execution of the license and ends with the completion of the 
enhancements or implementation. If the customer does not request
enhancements and implementation, the Company generally recognizes the 
license fee from these products upon delivery, provided that the other 
services are not essential to the functionality of the software. The 
Company does not recognize any license fees unless persuasive evidence 
of an arrangement exists, the license amount is fixed and determinable 
and collectability is probable. The Company software licensing 
agreements provide for a warranty period. The portion of the license fee 
associated with the warranty period is unbundled from the license fee 
and is recognized ratably over the warranty period.
Service revenues, which include client implementation and consulting 
fees, are recognized when the services are performed or on the 
percentage-of-completion method, depending on the contract terms.
Revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over
the term of the maintenance contract.
Unbilled revenue in the accompanying balance sheets represent revenues
recognized in excess of amounts collected or invoiced and deferred 
revenues represent amounts collected from or invoiced to customers
in excess of revenue recognized.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase and
whose carrying amount approximates market value due to the short maturity
of the investments. The Company maintains a centralized cash management
program whereby its excess cash balances are invested in high quality
short-term money market instruments through high credit quality financial
institutions. At times, cash balances in the Company accounts may exceed
federally insured limits. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1998
and 1997 include amounts on deposit with Safeguard Scientifics, Inc.
Safeguard, a shareholder of the Company, in conjunction with a note
agreement dated June 12, 1997. The demand note provides for borrowings by
Safeguard from the Company of up to a maximum of $12 million on a
revolving basis at Safeguard effective borrowing rate minus 75%. This
rate is higher than the Company is currently earning on its money market
investments. At December 31, 1998 and 1997 advances to Safeguard amounted
to $12 million and $111 million respectively. Interest income from these
advances amounted to $723 and $272 in 1998 and 1997, respectively.                    35            Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2  Significant Accounting Policies - continued
Accounts Receivable and Contracts in Process
Accounts receivable represent amounts billed and due from customers.
Accrued contractual revenues related to implementation contracts which
have been recognized under the percentage of completion method, but which
have not yet been billed, are reported as contracts in process. These
amounts are billable at specified dates, at contractual milestones or at
contract completion, which is generally expected to occur within one year.
Investments
In December 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with ELBA CSB 
S.A. ELBA, a newly formed subsidiary of ComputerLand Poland S.A., 
a Polish bank technology services firm which is also a public company. 
Concurrent with the ComputerLand agreement, the Company and ELBA also 
entered into a distribution and services agreement, which gives ELBA 
certain limited exclusive and non-exclusive PROFILE marketing rights 
in Poland and Central Europe. In conjunction with the agreement, the 
Company paid $1 million for a 10% equity interest in ELBA, which is 
accounted for under the cost method. During 1998, the Company made 
additional investments increasing its equity position to 12%. In 
February 1999, the shareholders of ELBA agreed to merge ELBA into 
ComputerLand; the Company will own approximately 1% of ComputerLand.
In June 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with Direct Capital 
Services P Ltd., an Indian technology services firm. Under the 
agreement, the Company paid $250 for a 10% equity interest in 
Sanchez/Capital Services P Ltd., which is accounted for under the 
cost method. Concurrent with the agreement, the Company and 
Sanchez/Capital Services also entered into a distribution, agency and 
services agreement, which gives Sanchez/Capital Services limited 
exclusive marketing rights in India and certain middle-eastern 
countries.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is carried at cost, except for assets under capital
leases which are recorded at the lower of the present value of future
lease payments or the fair value of the equipment at the inception of the
lease. Expenditures for major renewals, improvements and betterments are
capitalized and minor repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as
incurred. When assets are sold, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss from such
disposition is included in operations. The Company reviews its assets for
impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable.
Capitalized Software Costs
Certain development costs of the Company software products are
capitalized subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility
and up to the time the product becomes available for general release.
Amortization is provided on a product-by-product basis at the greater of
the amount computed using a the ratio of current revenues for a product
to the total of current and anticipated future revenues or b the
straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the
product. Generally, an original estimated economic life of four years is
assigned to capitalized software development costs. Costs of software
program maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
All capitalized software costs are written down to net realizable value
when the carrying amount is in excess thereof. Total costs capitalized in
1998, 1997 and 1996 were approximately $353, $668, and $532 respectively.
Amortization of capitalized software costs amounted to $413, $321, and
$218 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.                    36          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2  Significant Accounting Policies, continued
Taxes on Income
Deferred income taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between
the tax and financial reporting bases of the Company assets and
liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws and statutory rates.
Additionally, the benefits of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards
and credit carryforwards are recognized to the extent management of the
Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be
realized in future periods.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives
of the related assets using a combination of accelerated and straight line
depreciation methods. Equipment and furniture and fixtures have useful 
lives of 5 and 3 years, respectively. The useful life of leasehold 
improvements is the lesser of the lease term or 3 years.
Earnings Per Share
Effective December 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which
simplifies the requirements for computing earnings per share and requires
presentation of two amounts, basic and diluted earnings per share.
Earnings per share information for all periods presented has been restated
in accordance with the new standard.
Basic earnings per share has been calculated as net earnings divided by
weighted average common shares outstanding, while diluted earnings per
share has been computed as net earnings divided by weighted average common
and diluted shares outstanding. The following table provides a
reconciliation of weighted average common shares outstanding to weighted
average common and dilutive shares outstanding in thousands.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income and No. 131, Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information. Both statements were required
to be adopted during fiscal year ending December 31, 1998. The Company
adopted these pronouncements in 1998. There were no adjustments to the
Company financial position or results of operations.
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1998
presentation.

7  Shareholders' Equity
In May 1998, the Company Shareholders approved and amended the articles
of incorporation to increase the number of the Company authorized shares
of common stock from 50,000,000 to 75,000,000 shares.
On December 27, 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering for
the sale of 2,309,500 shares of its common stock at a price of $550 per
share. The Company received approximately $118 million in net proceeds
after deducting expenses related to the offering.
The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to certain limitations and
without Shareholder approval, to issue up to an aggregate 10,000,000
shares in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of the
shares in each series. No shares of preferred stock have been issued.
The 1995 Equity Compensation Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum
of 1,680,000 shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options,
stock appreciation rights, and/or restricted stock awards.
In May 1998, the Company shareholders approved an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESPP. Under the ESPP, employees of the Company can
purchase common stock through payroll deductions. A maximum of 300,000
shares are authorized for issuance under the ESPP. As of December 31,
1998, 15,398 shares have been purchased under the ESPP.
The Company applies APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
its various stock option plans. Had compensation cost been recognized
consistent with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
the Company net earnings and earnings per share would have been reduced
to the pro forma amounts indicated below                         Year Ended December 31,
1998   1997    1996
Net earnings          As reported  $ 7,034  $ 3,676  $ 1,407
Pro forma    5,470   3,443   1,357
Basic earnings per share    As reported    61    33    16
Pro forma     47    31    16
Diluted earnings per share   As reported    57    31    15
Pro forma     45    29    14
The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options issued by the
Company during 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $976, $407, and $111,
respectively, on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing
model. The Company used the following weighted-average assumptions to
determine the fair value of stock options granted: 1998 - expected
dividend yield of 0%, risk free interest rate of 439% to 575%, expected
volatility of 50%, and an average expected life of five years; 1997 -
expected dividend yield of 0%, risk free interest rate of 586% to 638    expected volatility of 40%, and an average expected life of five years;
1996 - expected dividend yield of 0%, risk-free interest rate of 636% to
648%, expected volatility of 0%, and average expected lives of three
years to five years.
Pro forma net earnings reflects only options granted in 1998, 1997, and
1996. Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost for
stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net
earnings amounts presented above because compensation cost is reflected
over the options' vesting period and compensation cost for options granted
prior to January 1, 1995 is not considered.                    40           Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1,609,415     678     $1224      476,771     $592
Generally, outstanding options vest over a two to four year period after
the date of grant and expire 6-10 years after the date of grant.
For options exercised in early 1995, 5% of the exercise price was paid
upon exercise, with the remaining obligation evidenced by a note with a
maximum term of 10 years, although the note also contains provisions for a
balloon payment due two years after the Company initial public offering.
Such optionees executed full recourse interest-bearing notes, with such
notes being reported as Notes due on common stock purchases in the
accompanying balance sheet. During 1997, one additional stock option
related loan was made to an officer of the Company in the amount of $111.
This loan is also supported by a full recourse demand note which bears
interest at 581%. In 1998, 1997 and 1996, interest income earned on these
notes amounted to $30, $34 and $40, respectively.                    41             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
