To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Sealed Air Corporation: 
We
have audited the consolidated financial statements of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2002, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 
As
discussed in Notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, as of January1, 2002.

SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      In thousands of dollars, except share and per share data    
Note1 General 
Sealed Air Corporation the Company, operating through its subsidiaries, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a wide range of food, protective and specialty packaging
products. 
The
Company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation US. These two subsidiaries directly and
indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the globe. This corporate structure was established in connection with
the Cryovac Transaction. See Note18 for a description of the Cryovac Transaction and certain related terms used in these notes. 
Note2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue
and expenses during the period reported. These estimates include assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable, the use and recoverability of inventory, the realization of deferred tax assets,
useful lives and recoverability of tangible and intangible assets and accruals for commitments and contingencies, among others. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of
revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling goods, and revenues are considered to be earned when the Company has completed the process
by which it is entitled to such revenues. The following criteria are used for revenue recognition: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, selling price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The Company policy is to invest cash in excess of short-term
operating and debt service requirements in such cash equivalents. These instruments are stated at cost, which approximates market value because of the short maturity of the instruments. 
43  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional allowances may be
required if the financial condition of the Company customers deteriorates. 
Commitments and ContingenciesLitigation 
On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against the Company. While it is typically very difficult to
determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final
adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance
recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual
outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has
previously made. 
Self-Insurance 
The Company retains the obligation for certain claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers' compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for
outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon management estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical
experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments, it is
possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. 
Pensions 
Although the Company maintains a non-contributory profit sharing and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible
to participate, the
Company does maintain defined benefit pension plans for certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The Company accounts for such pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions SFAS No87. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit
obligations and performance of plan assets. Certain of these assumptions include the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the expected
rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. Changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No87. 
Financial Instruments  The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments. These financial instruments generally include cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps, caps and
collars and foreign exchange forward contracts and options relating to the Company borrowing and trade activities. Such financial 
44  instruments are used from time to time to manage the Company exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company is exposed to credit risk if the counterparties to such transactions are unable to perform their obligations. However, the Company seeks to
minimize such risk by entering into transactions with counterparties that are major financial institutions with high credit ratings. 
Effective
January1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended by SFAS No137 and SFAS No138
SFAS No133, which require that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and establish criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered
into for hedging purposes. Prior to entering into any derivative transaction, the Company identifies the specific financial risk to which the Company is exposed, the appropriate hedging instrument to
be used to reduce the risk and the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging instrument. Purchase orders and historical data are used as the basis for determining the anticipated values
of the transactions to be hedged. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high correlation with the underlying financial risk. The Company regularly reviews its
hedge positions and the correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging instruments. 
The
Company accounts for derivative instruments as hedges of the related underlying risks if such derivative instruments are designated by the Company as hedges and are effective as hedges of
recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions. 
Gains
and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss, to the extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying transactions are
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations, at which time such gains and losses are
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses on qualifying fair value hedges and the related loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized
in the consolidated statement of operations. 
The
Company practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the underlying forecasted transaction is no longer deemed to
be probable of occurring. 
Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No133, the Company recorded realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign exchange hedging instruments including cross currency swaps, forwards and
options differently depending on whether the instrument qualified for hedge accounting. Gains and losses on those foreign exchange instruments that qualified as hedges were deferred as part of the
cost basis of the asset or liability being hedged and were recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the same period as the underlying transaction. Realized and unrealized gains and
losses on instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting were recognized currently in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company recorded net payments or receipts from interest rate
swaps, caps, collars and the interest rate component of cross currency swaps as adjustments to interest expense on a current basis. If an interest rate hedging instrument was terminated prior to its
maturity date, any gain or loss would have been amortized into earnings over the shorter of the original term of the derivative instrument and the remaining term of the underlying transaction. 
45  Accounts Receivable Securitization 
The Company two primary U.S. operating subsidiaries sell eligible U.S. accounts receivable to an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the
sole purpose of entering into an accounts receivable securitization program. Such wholly-owned subsidiary in turn sells an undivided ownership interest in such receivables to a bank or an issuer of
commercial paper administered by that bank. Such wholly-owned subsidiary retains the receivables it purchases from the two operating subsidiaries, except those as to which interests are sold by it to
the bank or to the issuer of commercial paper. The undivided ownership interest amounts sold are removed from the Company consolidated balance sheets at that time, and the proceeds from the sale are
reflected in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The retained receivables are included in notes and accounts receivable on the Company consolidated
balance sheets, and the carrying amounts thereof approximate fair value because of the relatively short-term nature of the receivables. Costs associated with the sale of receivables are
included in other income expense, net, in the Company consolidated statements of operations. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of most U.S. inventories is determined on a last-in, first-out LIFO basis, while the
cost of other inventories is determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, except for property and equipment that have been impaired, for which the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated fair value at
the impairment date. Significant improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred. The cost and accumulated
depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized upon the disposition of the assets. 
The
cost of property and equipment is depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows: buildings20 to 40years;
machinery and other property and equipment3 to 20years. 
Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations over their estimated fair value.
Identifiable intangible assets are included in other assets at cost and consist primarily of patents, licenses, trademarks and non-compete agreements. They are amortized over the shorter
of their legal lives or their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, generally ranging from 3 to 20years. Identifiable intangibles, other than goodwill, individually and
in the aggregate comprise less than 5% of the Company consolidated assets. 
In
July2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No141, Business Combinations SFAS No141, and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS No142. SFAS No141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business 
46  combinations initiated after June30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after June30, 2001. SFAS No142 requires that goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. A review of goodwill may be
initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless,
at businesses one level below that operating segment the component level, discrete financial information is prepared and
regularly reviewed by management, and such businesses have economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segments, in which
case such component is the reporting unit. A fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of
goodwill exceeds its fair value. An estimate of fair values for the Company as a whole and each of the Company reporting units is derived by using discounted cash flows, equity market capitalization
and comparative market multiples. The Company performs this annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year. This standard also requires that intangible assets with definite useful
lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. 
The
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No141 upon issuance and adopted SFAS No142 effective January1, 2002. Any goodwill and any intangible assets determined to have an
indefinite useful life that were acquired in a purchase business combination completed after June30, 2001 were not amortized, but were evaluated for impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets
acquired in business combinations completed before July1, 2001 were amortized through the end of 2001. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairments are recognized when the expected future undiscounted cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying value. For such cases,
losses are recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment, and where management has the current ability to remove such
assets from operations, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposition. Depreciation for these assets is suspended during the disposal period, which is generally
less than one year. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived
assets and possible impairment expense in the Company consolidated financial statements.
Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company follows the disclosure provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. As permitted by SFAS No123, the Company continues to
follow the measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. 
47  Foreign Currency Translation 
In non-U.S. locations that are not considered highly inflationary, the balance sheets are translated at the end of period exchange rates with translation
adjustments accumulated in shareholders' equity. Statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the applicable period. Assets and liabilities of the Company operations
in countries with highly inflationary economies are translated at the end of period exchange rates, except that certain financial statement amounts are translated at historical exchange rates. Items
included in statements of operations of the Company operations in countries with highly inflationary economies are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period, except that
certain financial statement amounts are translated at historical exchange rates. 
Income Taxes 
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries filea consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Company non-U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns in
their respective local jurisdictions. The Company provides for income taxes on those portions of its foreign subsidiaries' accumulated earnings that it believes are not reinvested indefinitely in
their businesses. 
Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are
determined using enacted tax rates. 
The
Company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized
should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that
realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. 
In
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax
benefit carryforwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to
tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation
allowance, which could materially impact the Company consolidated financial statements. 
Research and Development 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $59,283, $55,779 and $54,264 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Loss Earnings per Common Share 
Basic loss earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net loss earnings ascribed to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the
period. Net loss 
48  earnings ascribed to common shareholders represents net loss earnings plus gains attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock for an amount below its book value less preferred stock dividends.
The computation of diluted loss earnings per common share is similar, except that the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period are adjusted to reflect the potential issuance of
dilutive shares, and the related change in net loss earnings ascribed to common shareholders that would occur is factored into the calculation. 
Environmental Expenditures 
Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing business activities are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by
past operations, and which do not contribute to current or future net sales, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when the Company determines that environmental assessments or remediations are
probable and that the cost or a range of costs to the Company associated therewith can be reasonably estimated. 
Reclassifications 
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

goodwill, net, of $1,926,244, $1,913,000 and $1,959,909 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Note4 Accounts Receivable Securitization 
In December2001, the Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program the Receivables Facility with a bank
the Bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the Bank the ICP. Under the Receivables Facility, the Company two primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed
Air Corporation US the Originators, sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts receivable to Sealed Air Funding Corporation SA Funding Corp., an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the Receivables Facility. SA Funding Corp. in turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables Receivables Interests
to the Bank and the ICP, subject to certain conditions, up to a maximum of $125,000 of Receivables Interests outstanding from time to time. 
SA
Funding Corp. retains the receivables it purchases from the Originators, except those as to which Receivables Interests are sold by it to the Bank or the ICP. Sales of accounts receivable by the
Originators to SA Funding Corp. and sales of Receivables Interests from SA Funding Corp. to the Bank and the ICP have been structured as true sales under applicable laws, and the assets of SA
Funding Corp. are not available to pay any creditors of the Company or of its subsidiaries or affiliates. These transactions are accounted for as sales of receivables under the provisions of SFAS
No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. 
51  In
order to secure the performance of their obligations under the Receivables Facility, SA Funding Corp. and the Originators granted a first priority security interest to the Bank, as agent, in
certain collateral, including accounts receivable owned by them and proceeds and collections of those receivables. The Bank and the ICP have no recourse to the Company, the Originators' or SA
Funding Corp. other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due. As long as a termination event with respect
to the Receivables Facility has not occurred, the Originators service, administer and collect the receivables under the Receivables Facility as agent on behalf of SA Funding Corp., the Bank and the
ICP. Prior to a termination event under the Receivables Facility, collections of receivables not otherwise required to be paid to the Bank or the ICP are used by SA Funding Corp. to purchase new
eligible receivables from the Originators. The Company has undertaken to cause the Originators to perform their obligations under the Receivables Facility. 
The
scheduled expiration date for the Receivables Facility is December7, 2004. The Bank has extended its commitment to make purchases of Receivables Interests from SA Funding Corp. from
December7,
2002 to January26, 2004. However, under the terms of the extension, SA Funding Corp. may not sell any Receivables Interests to the Bank or the ICP until a definitive settlement agreement,
satisfactory to the Bank, has been entered into relating to the asbestos settlement see Note18. 
Under
certain limited circumstances, the Bank and the ICP can terminate purchases of Receivables Interests prior to the above dates. Events that could result in termination of the Receivables Facility
include a downgrade of the Company long-term senior unsecured debt to BB- or below by Standard Poor Rating Services Standard Poor or Ba3 or below by
Moody Investors Service,Inc. Moody, and failure to comply with interest coverage and debt leverage ratios. In connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of
2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs, the Company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the Receivables Facility.
After reflecting such waiver, the Company was in compliance with the requirements of the Receivables Facility as of December31, 2002. Since such waiver was as of December31, 2002, the
Company anticipates that it will request a waiver or amendment for future applicable periods. 
The
Receivables Facility provides for the payment from time to time of program fees which, after the Bank extension of the Facility to January2004, were 045% per annum 0375% per annum at
December31, 2002 on the Receivables Interests sold by SA Funding Corp. and commitment fees which were 040% per annum 0325% per annum at December31, 2002 on the unused portion of
the $125,000 Receivables Facility. 
During
2002, SA Funding Corp. sold Receivables Interests to the ICP from time to time; however, as of December31, 2002, neither the Bank nor the ICP held any Receivables Interests. 
In
December2001, receivables sold by the Originators to SA Funding Corp. amounted to approximately $176,900. SA Funding Corp. in turn sold Receivables Interests of $95,600 under the
Receivables Facility, and this amount was removed from the Company consolidated balance sheet. This amount was used to pay down certain of the Company outstanding borrowings. SA Funding Corp.
retained the remaining $81,300 of receivables that it acquired from the Originators. These retained receivables at December31, 2001 were included in notes and accounts receivable on the 
52  Company consolidated balance sheet. The carrying amount of the retained receivables approximates fair value because of the relatively short-term nature of the receivables. 
The
costs associated with the Receivables Facility are included in other income expense, net in the Company consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December31, 2002 and
2001. These costs primarily relate to the loss on the sale of the Receivables Interests to the Bank or the ICP, which were approximately $409 and $75 for 2002 and 2001, respectively, and program and
commitment fees and other associated costs, which were approximately $400 and $343 for 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
Note5 Acquisitions 
In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company made several acquisitions including the acquisitions of Dolphin Packaging plc and Shanklin Corporation in the third and fourth quarters of
2000, respectively. These businesses were acquired for cash in the aggregate amount of $10,465, $36,007 and $237,541 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and were accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. These acquisitions resulted in goodwill of approximately $7,300 in 2002, $16,700 in 2001 and $153,000 in 2000. In each year, cash used for acquisitions was net of cash acquired
in those acquisitions. Cash acquired in acquisitions was not material in 2002 or 2001 and was $8,589 in 2000. The Company did not assume any debt in acquisitions in 2002. In 2001 and 2000, the Company
assumed approximately $19,000 and $16,600, respectively, of debt in acquisitions. These acquisitions were not material to the Company consolidated financial statements.

foreign investment tax allowances $9,410 tax effected that have no expiration period. 
The
Company provides for income taxes on those portions of its foreign subsidiaries' accumulated earnings that it believes are not reinvested indefinitely in their businesses. As of
December31, 2002, the Company has provided $43,673 of taxes in respect of such accumulated earnings. 
Note10 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges 
2001 Restructuring Program 
During
2001, based primarily on weakening economic conditions, especially in the U.S., the Company conducted a review of its business to reduce costs and expenses, simplify business processes and
organizational structure, and to refine further the Company manufacturing operations and product offerings. As a result of such review, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
announced and began implementing a restructuring program that resulted in charges to operations of $32,805 for 2001. Such charges included the following: Year Ended
December 31, 2001 Employee termination costs 23,877 Facility exit costs 1,641 Long-lived asset impairments 7,287 Total 32,805 The
portion of this restructuring charge related to the Company food packaging segment was $21,116 and the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment was
$11,689. 
The
Company originally expected to incur $25,518 of cash outlays to carry out this restructuring program. Such cash outlays included primarily severance and other personnel-related costs as well as
lease and other contractual arrangement termination costs. As of December31, 2002, the Company had made total cash payments of approximately $17,600, of which approximately $11,779 were made
in 2002 and $5,821 were made in 2001. The cash restructuring liability recorded in 2001 of $25,518 was adjusted in 2002 for a net credit of $1,348, discussed below. After such cash outlays and the net
credit, 
56  the restructuring liability at December31, 2002 was $6,570, representing cash outlays expected to be made in 2003 and future years, primarily for severance-related costs. The 2001
restructuring program was substantially completed at December31, 2002. 
The
long-lived asset impairment of $7,287 included the following write-downs and write-offs: Year Ended
December 31, 2001 Property, plant and equipment 3,877 Goodwill 3,342 Certain other long-lived assets 68 Total 7,287 These
long-lived asset impairments related to decisions to rationalize and realign production of certain small product lines and to close several manufacturing and warehouse facilities in
North America, Europe, South Africa and the Asia Pacific region. The annual reduction of depreciation and amortization expense as a result of such asset impairments was $365. The Company has disposed
of all of the above property, plant and equipment. 
During
2002, the Company made an adjustment to the original 2001 restructuring provision, resulting in a net credit to the consolidated statement of operations of $1,348. The portion of this net
credit related to the Company food packaging segment amounted to a credit of $2,957, while the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment amounted to a charge of $1,609.
Such adjustment resulted from the completion of certain actions for amounts different than expected, certain headcount reductions obtained through attrition, and the revision of a plan to shut down
one of the Company manufacturing facilities. 
As
a result of the 2002 adjustments to the 2001 restructuring program, the Company now expects a net reduction in headcount of approximately 440 positions. This program originally estimated a net
headcount reduction of approximately 470. The revised net headcount reduction was reduced by approximately 30 positions that were eliminated by attrition. This net reduction consists of the
elimination of 677 positions from all geographic areas in which the Company does business but primarily from its manufacturing, sales and marketing functions in North America and Europe. As of
December31, 2002, 657 of these 677 positions had been eliminated. The Company also anticipates the addition of 237 positions in connection with its realignment or relocation of certain
manufacturing activities. 
57  The
components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through December31, 2002 and the remaining liability balance at December31, 2002 were as follows: Employee

Profit-Sharing and Retirement Savings Plans 
The Company has a non-contributory profit-sharing plan covering most of the Company U.S. employees. Contributions to this plan, which are made at the discretion
of the Board of Directors, may be made in cash, shares of the Company common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of the Company common stock. The Company also maintains contributory
thrift and retirement savings plans in which most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate. The contributory thrift and retirement savings plans generally provide for Company
contributions based upon the amount contributed to the plans by the participants. Company contributions to or provisions for its profit-sharing and retirement savings plans are charged to operations
and amounted to $36,248, $26,064 and $22,004 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002 and 2001, there were no shares of common stock issued for the Company contribution to its profit-sharing
plan. The value of shares of common stock issued as part of the Company contribution to the profit-sharing plan in 2000 was $13,877. 
Pension Plans 
The Company maintains pension plans for certain U.S. employees, including certain employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Net periodic pension costs for
all U.S. defined benefit pension plans charged to operations during 2002, 2001 and 2000 amounted to $1,008, $850 and $624, respectively. The balance sheets as of December31, 2002 and 2001
include prepaid pension assets of
$12,172 and $7,829, respectively. The aggregate benefit obligation at December31, 2002 and 2001 amounted to $23,808 and $19,671, respectively, while the fair value of plan assets at such dates
amounted to $21,046 and $18,862, respectively. 
58  
Note11 Employee Benefits and Incentive Programs Continued  Certain

carrying value of the Euro Notes increased approximately $29,000, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2002. 
60 
In March2002, the Company refinanced a portion of its short-term borrowings in Australia and New Zealand under an Australian dollar 175,000
approximately U.S. $92,300 at the then current exchange rate dual-currency revolving credit facility that expires on March12, 2005 the ANZ Facility. This facility was made
available to certain of the Company Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries by a syndicate of banks, and such borrowings are guaranteed by the Company. The amount outstanding under this facility at
December31, 2002 was approximately $57,500. Such amount is included in other long-term debt in the table above. 
Substantially
all the Company short-term borrowings of $53,355 at December31, 2002 were outstanding under lines of credit available to various of the Company U.S. and foreign
subsidiaries. Amounts available under these credit lines as of December31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $209,000 and $326,000, respectively, of which approximately $155,000 and $190,000,
respectively, were unused. 
At
December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit lines discussed above, of approximately $832,000 and $1,046,000,
respectively, of which approximately $721,000 and $903,000, respectively, were unused. Such credit lines include amounts available under the 2003 Facility defined below, the 364-Day
Facility defined below at December31, 2001 and other lines of credit available to the Company subsidiaries. As of December31, 2002, the total lines of credit of $832,000 include
committed lines of credit of approximately $622,000 and uncommitted lines of credit of approximately $210,000. Such committed lines of credit primarily include the 2003 Facility and the ANZ Facility.
The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit. At
December31, 2002, the Company principal revolving credit facility was a $525,000 facility that expires on March30, 2003 the 2003 Facility. The 2003 Facility provides that the
Company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow for various purposes until the expiration or earlier termination of such Facility, including the refinancing of existing debt, the provision of
working capital and other general corporate needs, including acquisitions, repurchases of the Company outstanding common and preferred stock and capital expenditures. 
Amounts
repaid under the 2003 Facility may be re-borrowed from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the Facility. As of December31, 2002, facility fees
were payable at the rate of 0095% per annum under the 2003 Facility on the total amounts available under the credit facility. The
obligations under the 2003 Facility bear interest at floating rates. The floating rates are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the interbank rate for the relevant
currency and time period. The weighted average interest rate for outstanding borrowings under the 2003 Facility was approximately 42% at December31, 2001. There were no borrowings outstanding
under the 2003 Facility as of December31, 2002. 
The
2003 Facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Company long-term senior unsecured debt ratings and certain financial criteria. The 2003
Facility, the ANZ Facility, the Euro Notes, the 875% Senior Notes and the 695% Senior Notes impose limitations on the operations of the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries. These limitations include, depending upon the debt in question, financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage as well as restrictions on the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, the creation of liens, sale and leaseback transactions, mergers and acquisitions and certain dispositions of assets. In connection with recording the accounting 
61  charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs, the Company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided
for in the 2003 Facility. After reflecting such waiver, the Company was in compliance with the requirements of each of the above instruments as of December31, 2002. 
The
Company had a 364-day $194,375 revolving credit facility the 364-Day Facility that the Company allowed to expire on March22, 2002. No borrowings were
outstanding under this Facility at the time of its expiration or at December31, 2001. 
Scheduled
annual maturities of long-term debt, exclusive of debt discounts, for the five years subsequent to December31, 2002 are as follows:
2003$2,049; 2004$2,013; 2005$59,973; 2006$207,235;
2007$1,067; and thereafter$601,283. Note13 Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
Effective January1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended by SFAS No137 and
SFAS No138 SFAS No133, which requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of
transactions entered into for hedging purposes. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No133 was not material to the Company 2001 consolidated financial statements. 
The
Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company enters
into various derivative instruments from time to time pursuant to its risk management policies. Designation of derivative instruments as hedges is performed on a transaction basis to support hedge
accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The
Company assesses the initial and ongoing effectiveness of its hedging relationships in accordance with its documented policy. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. 
The
Company subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure from buying and selling in currencies other than their functional currencies. The primary purpose of the Company foreign currency
hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value associated with the amounts receivable or payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. At December31, 2002 and
2001, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts, with aggregate notional amounts of approximately $146,910 maturing through April2003 and $266,900, which matured through
June2002, respectively. Such contracts qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges, and had original maturities of less than twelve months. 
In
June2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $50,000 that were qualified and designated as fair value hedges in accordance with
SFAS No133. These agreements were entered into in order to, among other things, convert a portion of the 875% Senior Notes fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. During
September2002, the Company terminated these swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the 875% Senior Notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately $2,416. Such amount is being
amortized and reflected as a component 
62  of interest expense over the remaining life of the 875% Senior Notes. The Company was not party to any interest rate swap agreements at December31, 2002 or 2001. 
The
Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as options and collars to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange options to manage exposure to
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing while limiting foreign exchange exposure and limiting or
adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. 
Gains
and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive loss income, to the extent that such hedges are effective and until the underlying transactions are
recognized in earnings, at which time such gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. Included in other comprehensive loss income for the years ended
December31, 2002 and 2001 were net unrealized losses of $29 after tax $33 pre-tax, and net unrealized losses of $131 after tax $210 pre-tax, respectively, all of
which are expected to be included in the consolidated statement of operations within the next twelve months when the underlying transactions are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations.
The unrealized amounts in other comprehensive loss income will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts during each reporting period. The Company practice is to terminate
derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the underlying forecasted transaction is no longer deemed to be probable of occurring. The
Company cash flow hedges for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 were effective. 
The
Company is exposed to credit losses if the counterparties to its outstanding derivative contracts are unable to perform their obligations. However, it does not expect any counterparties to fail to
perform as they are major financial institutions with high credit ratings and financial strength. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the Company exposure to losses arising out of derivative
contracts could be material if the counterparties to such agreements fail to perform their obligations. 
Note14 Financial Instruments 
The Company is required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to disclose its estimate of the fair value of material financial
instruments, including those recorded as assets or liabilities in its consolidated financial statements and derivative financial instruments. The carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities
approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. The fair value of the Company 875% Senior Notes, 695% Senior Notes, Euro Notes and SeriesA convertible preferred
stock are based on quoted market prices. The fair value estimates of the Company various other debt instruments were derived by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering
prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date. Such estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and
matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the Company estimates. The fair values of the Company various
derivative instruments, which are based on current market rates, generally reflect the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date. 
63  All
financial instruments inherently expose the holders to market risk, including changes in currency and interest rates. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular
operating and financing activities and, when it considers appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. 
The
Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. For further discussion of derivative instruments relating to the implementation of SFAS No133 see Note13. 
The
carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments at December31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2002

fair value of the debt in the table above differs from the carrying amount due to changes in interest rates based on the market conditions as of December31, 2002. Generally, the fair value
of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The carrying value of the SeriesA convertible preferred stock in the table above is reflected in
the consolidated balance sheets at its mandatory redemption value of $5000 per share. See Note15 for further discussion of the convertible preferred stock. 
The
Company subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure from buying and selling in currencies other than their functional currencies. The primary purpose of the Company foreign currency
hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value associated with the amounts receivable or payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. At December31, 2002 and
2001, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts, with aggregate notional amounts of approximately $146,910 maturing through April2003 and $266,900, which matured through
June2002, respectively.

706,265 Contingent Stock Plan and Directors Stock Plan 
The Company contingent stock plan provides for the granting to employees of awards to purchase common stock during the succeeding 60-day period for less than
100% of fair market value at the date of award. Shares issued under the contingent stock plan contingent stock are restricted as to disposition by the holders for a period of at least three years
after award. In the event of termination of employment prior to lapse of the restriction, the shares are subject to an option to repurchase by the Company at the price at which the shares were issued.
Such restriction lapses prior to the expiration of the vesting period if certain events occur that affect the existence or control of the Company. The aggregate fair value of contingent stock issued
is credited to common stock and additional paid-in capital accounts, and the unamortized portion of the compensation is deducted from shareholders' equity. The excess of fair value over
the award price of contingent stock is charged to operations as compensation expense over a three-year period. Such charges amounted to $7,847, $9,962, and $16,015 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. 
Non-cash
compensation in 2002 comprises shares issued to non-employee directors in the form of awards under the Company 2002 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors
the 2002 Directors Stock Plan, which was approved by the stockholders of the Company at the 2002 annual meeting. The 2002 Directors Stock Plan provides for annual grants of shares to
non-employee directors, and interim grants of shares to eligible directors elected at times other than at an annual meeting, at a price per share equal to the par value of the shares, as
all or part of the annual or interim retainer fees for non-employee directors. During 2002, the Company adopted a plan that permits non-employee directors to elect to defer all
or part of their annual retainer until the non-employee director retires from the Board. The non-employee director can elect to defer the portion of the annual retainer payable
in shares of stock. If such an election is made, the non-employee director may also elect to 
65  defer the portion, if any, of the annual retainer payable in cash. The excess of fair value over the price at which shares are issued under this plan is charged to operations at the date of such
grant. Such charge amounted to $352 in 2002. 
In
2001 and 2000, the Company made grants of shares to non-employee directors at a price of $100 per share under the then-effective Restricted Stock Plan for
Non-Employee Directors the 1998 Directors Stock Plan, which was terminated when the 2002 Directors Stock Plan was approved. The excess of fair value over the price at which shares are
issued under this plan is charged to operations at the date of such grant. Such charges amounted to $367 and $587 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Shares issued under both plans are restricted as to
disposition by the holders as long as such holders remain directors of the Company. 
Amortization
expense related to the issuance of 60,000 and 50,000 shares in 2000 and 1999, respectively, of the Company common stock in exchange for certain non-employee consulting
services was $1,639, $1,639 and $1,474, in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Such shares vest ratably over a three to five year period and are amortized on a straightline basis. 
The
Company has adopted only the disclosure provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, but applies APB No25 and related interpretations in accounting for
these plans. Since the compensation cost noted above is consistent with the compensation cost that would have been recognized for such plans under the provisions of SFAS No123, the pro forma
disclosure requirements under such statement are not applicable for these plans. 
A
summary of the changes in shares available for the Contingent Stock Plan and the Directors Stock Plan follows: 2002

Redeemable Preferred Stock SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock 
The Company SeriesA preferred stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is convertible at any time into approximately 0885 of a share of common stock for
each share of preferred stock. These shares vote with the common stock on an as-converted basis and are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends, when and as declared by the Board of
Directors, at an annual rate of $200 per share, payable quarterly in arrears on the first business day of the succeeding calendar quarter. The SeriesA preferred stock ranks senior to the
Company common stock and junior to the Company indebtedness. On and after March31, 2003, the SeriesA preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the Company at a price of $5100
per share declining ratably on each March31 thereafter to $5000 per share on and after March31, 2008, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. The SeriesA preferred stock is
subject to mandatory redemption on March31, 2018 at $5000 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, to the extent these shares remain outstanding. 
Because
it is subject to mandatory redemption, the SeriesA convertible preferred stock is classified outside of the shareholders' equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. At its date
of issuance, the fair value of the SeriesA preferred stock exceeded its mandatory redemption amount primarily due to the common stock conversion feature. Accordingly, the book value of the
SeriesA preferred stock is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at its mandatory redemption value. 
During
2002, the Company repurchased 782,500 shares of the Company convertible preferred stock at a cost of approximately $28,834, representing a cost of approximately $10,291 below its book value.
During 2001, the Company repurchased 524,220 shares of the Company convertible preferred stock at a cost of approximately $18,754, representing a cost of approximately $7,456 below its book value.
This excess of book value over the purchase price of the preferred stock was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in-capital. 
The
following is a summary of changes during 2002, 2001 and 2000 in shares of the Company SeriesA preferred stock: 2002

434,900 Stock Options 
Stock option plans in which certain employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated were terminated effective March31, 1998 in connection with the Cryovac
Transaction except with respect to 
67  options that remained outstanding as of such date, which were granted at an exercise price equal to their fair market value on the date of grant. Such options have terms expiring up to
March2007. 
During
2002, 2001 and 2000, 27,911, 19,997 and 22,379 options, respectively, were exercised with an aggregate exercise price of $917, $504 and $860, respectively. At December31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, 335,992, 371,178 and 395,116 options, respectively, to purchase shares of common stock were outstanding at an average per share exercise price of $3866, $3828 and $3766, respectively. 
The
pro forma effect on earnings and earnings per common share of applying SFAS No123 for those options outstanding at the time of the termination of the plans were as follows: Year Ended
December 31,
2000 Net earnings ascribed to common shareholders As reported 206,366 Pro forma1 206,191 Basic earnings per common share As reported 247 Pro forma1 246 Diluted earnings per common share As reported 193 Pro forma1 193 1These
pro forma amounts calculated in accordance with SFAS No123 may not be indicative of future net earnings or earnings per common share effects. 
All
options outstanding upon the termination of the plans in 1998 fully vested prior to January1, 2001; therefore, there is no pro forma effect on earnings and earnings per
common share as a result of applying SFAS No123 for subsequent years. 
To
compute the pro forma effect on earnings and earnings per common share in the table above, the fair value of 1997 option grants, the last year in which options were granted before termination of
the plans, after giving effect to adjustments provided for in the Cryovac Transaction, was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following historical weighted average
assumptions: dividend yields of 1%; expected volatility of 29%; risk-free interest rates of 6%; and 4years of expected life. 
Based
on the above assumptions, the weighted-average fair value of each option granted in 1997 was $1060 after giving effect to the Cryovac Transaction.

In calculating diluted loss earnings per common share, the weighted average number of common shares assumes the exercise of dilutive stock options in 2000 as well as the
shares of preferred stock repurchased in each year. The shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement are not reflected in the 2002 loss per common share calculations
since the effect would be anti-dilutive i.e., would reduce the loss per common share. Except as noted in the table below, the outstanding preferred stock is not assumed to be converted
in the calculation of diluted loss earnings per common share because the treatment of the preferred stock as the common stock into which it is convertible would be anti-dilutive i.e.,
would reduce the loss per common share or increase earnings per common share in those years. 
The
following table sets forth the reconciliation of the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 shares in thousands. 2002

Note18 Commitments and Contingencies 
Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs 
On November27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the appropriate parties to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against
it and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac Transaction. The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius, that had been made
against the Company in connection with the Cryovac Transaction. On December3, 2002, the agreement in principle was approved by the Company Board of Directors. The Company was advised that
both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December5, 2002. For a description of the Cryovac Transaction, asbestos-related claims and the parties involved, see
Cryovac Transaction and Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction below. 
The
Company recorded a charge of $850,118 as a result of the asbestos settlement in the consolidated statement of operations as of December31, 2002. Such expense consisted of the following
items: a
non-cash charge of $512,500 covering a cash payment required to be made by the Company upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in
the bankruptcy of New Grace. Because it is uncertain when such a plan of reorganization may become effective, this liability has been recorded as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet
as of December31, 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at a 55% annual rate from December21, 2002 to the date of payment.
Such interest through December31, 2002, amounted to $861 and is included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet. a
non-cash charge of $321,480 representing the fair market value of 9,000,000 shares of the Company common stock reserved for issuance pursuant
to such settlement upon the effectiveness of New Grace plan of reorganization. Such shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions including the effects of stock splits, stock
dividends and certain other events affecting the Company common stock. Such fair market value was $3572 per common share as of the close of business on December5, 2002. Such amount has
been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2002 as follows: $900 representing the aggregate par value of such shares has been recorded in common stock reserved for
issuance related to the asbestos settlement and the remaining $320,580, representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate par value of such common shares, has been recorded
in additional paid-in capital. The shares of common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement are not reflected in the 2002 loss per common share calculations since
the effect would be anti-dilutive i.e., would reduce the loss per common share. $16,138
of legal and related fees. In
2001, other expense in the consolidated statement of operations included $11,995 of expense of which $8,149 was primarily a result of the Company guarantee, entered into at the time of the
Cryovac Transaction, of certain debt payable by W. R. Grace Co.Conn., which filed for reorganization along with New Grace, and $3,846 of legal and related fees. Cryovac Transaction 
On
March31, 1998, the Company completed a multi-step transaction the Cryovac Transaction, which brought the Cryovac packaging business and the former Sealed Air Corporation
old Sealed 
70  Air under the common ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company acts as a holding company. As part of that transaction, the Cryovac packaging
business, held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, was separated from the remaining businesses of the Company. Such remaining businesses were then contributed to a company now
known as W. R. Grace Co. New Grace, whose shares were distributed to the Company stockholders. As a result, New Grace became a separate publicly owned company. The Company recapitalized
its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock. A subsidiary of the Company then merged into old Sealed Air, which changed its name to Sealed Air
Corporation US. The agreements pursuant to which the Cryovac Transaction was carried out are referred to below as the Transaction Agreements. 
Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction 
In
connection with the Cryovac Transaction, New Grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the Cryovac Transaction, whether accruing or occurring before
or after the Cryovac Transaction, other than liabilities arising from or relating to Cryovac operations. The liabilities retained by New Grace include, among others, liabilities relating to
asbestos-containing products previously manufactured or sold by New Grace subsidiaries prior to the Cryovac Transaction, including its primary U.S. operating subsidiary, W. R. Grace
Co.Conn., which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of New Grace since the Cryovac Transaction. The Transaction Agreements provided that, should any
claimant seek to hold the Company, including any of its subsidiaries, responsible for liabilities of New Grace or its subsidiaries, including such asbestos-related liabilities, New Grace and its
subsidiaries would indemnify and defend the Company. 
Since
the beginning of 2000, the Company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac Transaction, the Company is responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of
New Grace and its subsidiaries, certain of which were also named as co-defendants in some of these actions. These actions include several purported class actions and a number of personal
injury lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death, while others seek medical monitoring, environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation product.
Neither old Sealed Air nor Cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestos-containing materials that are the subjects of these cases. None of these cases has been resolved through judgment,
settlement or otherwise. All such cases have been stayed in connection with New Grace Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding discussed below. 
While
the allegations in these actions directed to the Company vary, these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac Transaction was a fraudulent
transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a theory of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against New Grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the Company liable for
liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the Cryovac Transaction by W. R. Grace Co.Conn. or other New Grace subsidiaries. A transfer
would be a fraudulent transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer, was engaged or was about to
engage in a business for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature. A transfer may
also be fraudulent if it was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. If any transfers in connection with the Cryovac Transaction were found by a court to be 
71  fraudulent transfers, the Company could be required to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund certain liabilities of New Grace or its subsidiaries for the
benefit of their creditors, including asbestos claimants. The Company has reached an agreement in principle, described below, that will resolve all such claims. Previously, the Company was unable to
estimate the loss or range of loss in the event that there had been a finding that the Cryovac Transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. 
In
the Joint Proxy Statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the Cryovac Transaction, both Sealed Air and Grace stated that it was their belief that New Grace and its
subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the Cryovac Transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac Transaction would be a
fraudulent transfer. They also stated their belief that the Cryovac Transaction complied with other relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached conclusions
adverse to the Company, such determination could have had a materially adverse effect on the Company consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
On
April2, 2001, New Grace and certain of its subsidiaries filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of
Delaware. New Grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999. 
In
connection with its Chapter 11 filing, New Grace filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to stay, among others, all actions brought against the Company including certain of its
subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of New Grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The court issued an order dated May3, 2001, which was modified
on January22, 2002, under which all such filed or pending actions against the Company were stayed and all such future actions are stayed upon filing and service on the Company. No further
proceedings involving the Company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court. 
Committees
appointed to represent asbestos claimants in New Grace bankruptcy case received the court permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the Company and its
subsidiary Cryovac,Inc. and against Fresenius, as discussed below. The claims against Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between Fresenius and W. R. Grace
Co.Conn. Fresenius is not affiliated with the Company. In March2002, the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of New Grace following the Cryovac
Transaction and whether New Grace received reasonably equivalent value in the Cryovac Transaction would be tried on behalf of all creditors of New Grace. The proceeding is pending in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware Adv. No02-02210. 
In
June2002, the court permitted the U.S. government to intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding, so that the U.S. government could pursue allegations that remediation
expenses at certain sites were underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of New Grace that were conducted at the time of the Cryovac Transaction. The court also permitted New Grace, which
asserted that the Cryovac Transaction was not a fraudulent transfer, to intervene in the proceeding. In July2002, the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the
trial, holding, among other things, that, subject to certain limitations, post-1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of New Grace. The Company believes that only claims
and liabilities that were known or 
72  reasonably should have been known at the time of the 1998 Cryovac Transaction should be considered pursuant to the applicable standard. The trial was scheduled to commence December9, 2002. 
On
November27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees prosecuting the claims against the Company and Cryovac,Inc., to resolve all current and future
asbestos-related claims arising from the Cryovac Transaction. On the same day, the court entered an order confirming that an amicable resolution of the disputes among the parties had been reached and
that counsel for the Company and the Committees had agreed and bound the parties to the terms of the agreement in principle. As discussed above, the agreement in principle calls for payment of
9,000,000 shares of Sealed Air common stock and $512,500 in cash, plus interest on the cash payment at a 55% annual rate starting on December21, 2002 and ending on the effective date of the
New Grace plan of reorganization, when payment must be made. Such shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions including the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and
certain other events affecting the Company common stock. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company cannot seek indemnity from New Grace for this payment. On December3, 2002, the agreement in
principle was approved by the Company Board of Directors. The Company was advised that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December5, 2002. The parties are
jointly engaged in the process of drafting a definitive settlement agreement consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle. Once signed by the appropriate parties, the settlement agreement
will be presented to the court for approval and will eventually be incorporated into New Grace plan of reorganization and, assuming approval by New Grace creditors as part of the approval of the
plan of reorganization, will then be implemented. 
The
settlement, upon approval and implementation in the New Grace bankruptcy, will provide that, upon the effective date of New Grace plan of reorganization and payment of the shares and cash, all
present and future asbestos-related claims against the Company and its affiliates that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of New Grace and its affiliates including former affiliates that became
affiliates of the Company through the Cryovac Transaction will be channeled to and become the responsibility of one or more trusts to be established as part of New Grace plan of reorganization. The
settlement will also resolve all fraudulent transfer claims against the Company and its affiliates arising from the Cryovac Transaction as well as the claims of Fresenius described below. The
settlement will provide that the Company and its affiliates will receive releases of all such claims. As a condition to the Company obligation to make the payments required by the settlement, New
Grace plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement, including provisions for the trusts and releases referred to above and for an injunction barring the prosecution of
any asbestos-related claims against the Company and its affiliates. It is expected that the order approving the settlement agreement will also provide that the stay of proceedings involving the
Company described above will continue through the effective date of New Grace plan of reorganization, after which the Company will be released from the liabilities asserted in those proceedings and
their continued prosecution against the Company will be enjoined. 
In
January2002, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings,Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG, a German company, and certain of its affiliates
collectively, Fresenius in New York State court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the
parties. Fresenius contended that the Company was obligated to indemnify Fresenius for certain liabilities that Fresenius might incur as a result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. 
73  Fresenius contention was based on its interpretation of the agreements between Fresenius and W. R. Grace Co.Conn. in connection with the 1996 Fresenius
transaction. In February2002, Fresenius announced that it had accrued a charge of $172,000 for such potential liabilities, which include pre-transaction tax liabilities of New
Grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from New Grace Chapter 11 filing. The Company believed that it was not responsible to indemnify Fresenius under the 1996 agreements and filed the
action in order to proceed to a resolution of Fresenius claims. In April2002, Fresenius filed a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor. The Company
opposed the motion, and in June2002, the court reserved decision after oral argument. No written order has been issued, and the parties have requested the court to defer issuing a ruling
pending implementation of the definitive settlement agreement between the Company and the Committees. As noted above, as a result of the November27, 2002 agreement in principle referred to
above, the parties expect that there will be mutual releases exchanged between Fresenius and the Company releasing any and all claims related to the 1996 Fresenius transaction. In
view of New Grace Chapter 11 filing, the Company may receive additional claims asserting that the Company is liable for obligations that New Grace had agreed to retain in the Cryovac Transaction
and for which the Company may be contingently liable. To date, no material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the Company. 
Final
determinations and accountings under the Transaction Agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the Cryovac Transaction had not been completed at the time of New Grace Chapter 11 filing.
The Company expects to filea claim in the bankruptcy proceeding that will include all of the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that New Grace agreed to retain or that are
subject to indemnification by New Grace under the Transaction Agreements other than payments to be made under the settlement agreement. New Grace alleges that the Company is responsible for certain
amounts under the Transaction Agreements. Any amounts for which the Company may be liable to New Grace may be used to offset New Grace liabilities to the Company. Costs and liabilities for which the
Company intends to seek indemnification by New Grace will also include certain defense costs related to asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the Fresenius claims, the guaranteed debt paid
by the Company described above, and any of the other potential claims against the Company mentioned above. Except to the extent of any potential setoff or similar claim, the Company expects that its
claim will be as an unsecured creditor of New Grace. It is not currently possible to determine the amount of the Company claim against New Grace, the extent to which such claim may be secured by
setoff, how much of that claim may be allowed, or the amount of the Company recovery on such claim, if any, in the bankruptcy proceeding. 
Leases 
The
Company is obligated under the terms of various leases covering primarily warehouse and office facilities, as well as certain smaller manufacturing sites that it occupies. The Company accounts for
substantially all of its leases as operating leases. Net rental expense was $24,264, $23,238 and $23,497 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under
noncancelable real property leases are as follows: 2003$23,758; 2004$18,949; 2005$13,773;
2006$10,515; 2007$9,265; and subsequent years$12,123. 
74 
Long-Term Commitments 
The
Company entered into the following long-term commitments during 2002: Approximately
$36,000 for the purchase of certain equipment over an eight-year period beginning in 2003, together with a potential termination
fee in an amount to be determined. The Company obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and certain indexes. Estimated future minimum annual commitments are
as follows: 2003$3,500; 2004$3,900; 2005$4,500; 2006 $5,000; 2007$5,500; and
subsequent years$13,600. Failure to purchase any of the minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the Company to pay an amount of 45% of such shortfall. Approximately
$9,500 to a supplier if the Company fails to purchase 142,700,000 pounds of certain raw materials, at the then current market price, over a
ten-year period that began in May,2002. The amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the Company purchase of minimum quantities required under the
contract. At December31, 2002, the Company purchases were in line with the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement. Note19 New Accounting Pronouncements 
As required by SFAS No142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives had to be tested for impairment as of January1, 2002 and then tested for
impairment at least annually. As required by
this statement, the Company completed its assessment process as of June30, 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary as of January1, 2002 on a reporting unit basis.
The Company also completed its annual testing for impairment for 2002 during the fourth quarter of 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary on a reporting unit basis. 
As
of December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of $1,926,244 and $1,913,000, respectively. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $57,005 and $51,776
in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Beginning January1, 2002, in accordance with SFAS No142, the Company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill. Although goodwill
will no longer be systematically amortized, this statement requires that periodic reviews be conducted to assess whether or not the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. Such reviews could
result in future write-downs of goodwill which would be reflected as a charge against operating income. 
As
of December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives with a gross carrying value of approximately $69,100 and $63,600, respectively, less
accumulated amortization of approximately $47,700 and $40,100, respectively. Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was approximately $7,200 for 2002. Assuming no change in the gross carrying
value of identifiable intangible assets from the value at December31, 2002, the estimated amortization for the year ended December31, 2003 and the next four succeeding years is
approximately $7,200 per year. Such assets are reflected in other assets in the Company consolidated balance sheets. At December31, 2002 and 2001, there were no identifiable intangible
assets, other than goodwill, with indefinite useful lives as defined by SFAS No142.

On January1, 2003, the Company will adopt SFAS No143, Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS No143, which provides the accounting
requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets. This statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The adoption of SFAS No143 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. On
January1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No144, which excludes from the
definition of long-lived assets goodwill and other intangibles that are not amortized in accordance with SFAS No142. SFAS No144 requires that the disposal of
long-lived assets by sale be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. SFAS
No144 also expands the reporting of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have been or will be disposed of rather than limiting such discontinuance to a segment of a
business. The adoption of SFAS No144 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In
June2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS No146. SFAS No146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF Issue
No94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring EITF
94-3 and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value in the period in which the liability is
incurred. Under EITF 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was required to be recognized at the date of an entity commitment to an exit plan. The adoption of SFAS No146 is expected
to result in delayed recognition for certain types of costs as compared to the provisions of EITF 94-3. SFAS No146 is effective for new exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December31, 2002, and does not affect amounts currently reported in the Company consolidated financial statements. SFAS No146 will affect the types and timing of
costs included in future restructuring programs, if any. 
On
January1, 2003, the Company will adopt SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure SFAS No148, which
provides alternative methods of transition for companies that choose to switch to the fair value method of accounting for stock options. SFAS No148 also makes changes in the disclosure
requirements for stock-based compensation, regardless of which method of accounting is chosen. As discussed in Note15, the Company terminated all previously maintained stock option plans
effective March31, 1998 in connection with the Cryovac Transaction, except with respect to options that were still outstanding as of such date. The adoption of SFAS No148 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
In
November2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
Interpretation No45. Interpretation No45 requires the disclosure of certain guarantees existing at December31, 2002. The Company had no guarantees meeting the
requirements of Interpretation No45 at December31, 2002. In addition, Interpretation No45 requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the obligation of
qualifying guarantee activities that are initiated or modified after 
77  December31, 2002. Accordingly, the Company will apply the recognition provisions of Interpretation No45 prospectively to applicable guarantee activities initiated after
December31, 2002. 
In
January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities Interpretation No46. Interpretation No46 requires that the
assets, liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the company that has the controlling financial interest. Interpretation
No46 also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to it.
Interpretation No46 will be effective for the Company on February1, 2003 for variable interest entities created after January31, 2003, and on July31, 2003 for variable
interest entities created prior to February1, 2003. Based on its preliminary analysis of Interpretation No46, the Company does not currently expect the adoption of Interpretation
No46 to have a material impact on its 2003 consolidated financial statements.
