1 Nature of Business
We are a multinational diversified producer of premium
specialty papers headquartered in the United States of America. We manufacture
and sell paper and reconstituted tobacco products to the tobacco industry as
well as specialized paper products for use in other applications. Tobacco
industry products comprised 93 percent of our 2004, 2003 and 2002 consolidated
net sales. The primary products in this group include cigarette, plug wrap and
tipping papers used to wrap various parts of a cigarette, reconstituted tobacco
leaf, or RTL, which is used as a blend with virgin tobacco in cigarettes,
reconstituted tobacco wrappers and binders for cigars and paper products used
in cigarette packaging. These products are sold directly to the major tobacco
companies or their designated converters in North and South America, western
and eastern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
We are the premier manufacturer of high porosity
papers, which are used in manufacturing ventilated cigarettes, and the leading independent
producer of reconstituted tobacco leaf used in producing blended cigarettes. We conduct business in over 90 countries and
currently operate 10 production locations worldwide, with paper mills in the
United States, France, Brazil and Indonesia.
Our manufacturing facilities have a long history of
producing paper dating back to 1545. Our domestic mills led the development of
the North American tobacco-related papers manufacturing industry, which was
originated by Peter J. Schweitzer,Inc. that began as an importer of
cigarette papers from France in 1908.
As used in this 2004
Annual report on Form10-K, unless the context indicates otherwise,
references to we, us, our, SWM, Schweitzer-Mauduit or similar terms
include Schweitzer-Mauduit International,Inc. and our consolidated
subsidiaries.
Note
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. We believe the estimates and assumptions used in the
preparation of these consolidated financial statements are reasonable, based
upon currently available facts and known circumstances, but recognize that
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions as a result of a
number of factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this report and in
our other public filings from time to time.
Our wholly-owned direct
subsidiaries are Schweitzer-Mauduit Canada,Inc., or SM-Canada,
Schweitzer-Mauduit Spain, S.L., or SM-Spain, a holding company organized under
the Spanish holding company regime and the primary foreign investment holding
company for SWM, and Schweitzer-Mauduit International China, Limited, a
currently inactive holding company incorporated in Hong Kong. We indirectly
through SM-Spain have subsidiaries in France, Brazil and Indonesia. SM-Spain
owns directly 100 percent of Schweitzer-Mauduit Holding S.A.R.L., a French
holding company, or SMH, and together SM-Spain and SMH own 100 percent of 2
holding companies, Schweitzer-Mauduit Industries S.A.R.L., a French
corporation, or SMI, which holds our investment in the French reconstituted
tobacco operations, and Schweitzer-Mauduit France S.A.R.L., a French
corporation, or SMF, which holds our French and  61  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Indonesian paper
operations. SMI owns directly 72 percent of the issued and outstanding shares
of LTR Industries S.A., a French corporation, or LTRI. SMF, directly or
indirectly, owns 100 percent of 3 principal French operating subsidiaries,
Papeteries de Mauduit S.A.S., or PdM, Papeteries de Malaucne S.A.S., or PdMal,
and Papeteries de Saint-Girons S.A.S., or PdStG, and 100 percent of our
Indonesian paper operations, P.T. PDM Indonesia. SMF also owns 100 percent of
PDM Philippines Industries,Inc., or PPI, which was established in 2004 to
acquire the operating assets in conjunction with a pending Philippines
acquisition. SM-Spain also owns directly 9999 percent of the issued and
outstanding shares of Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil S.A., a Brazilian
corporation, or SWM-B. We did not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint
ventures or special purpose entities as of December31, 2004.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Schweitzer-Mauduit International,Inc.
and our wholly owned, controlled majority-owned and financially controlled
subsidiaries. Minority interest represents minority stockholders proportionate
share of the equity in our Brazilian and LTRI operations. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year financial statement
presentation.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue and
the related accounts receivable when the following 4 criteria are met: 1persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; 2ownership has transferred to the
customer; 3the selling price is fixed and determinable; and 4collectibility
is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria 4is based on our
judgment regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable. Generally, we
recognize revenue when we ship our manufactured product and title and risk of
loss passes to our customer in accordance with the terms of sale of the product.
Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated f.o.b., or
free on board, shipping point. For sales transactions designated f.o.b.
destination, revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customers
delivery site, at which time title and risk of loss are transferred. Provisions
for discounts, returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period the related revenue is recorded. Deferred
revenue represents advance payments from customers which are earned based upon
a mutually agreed-upon amount per unit of future product sales.
Freight Costs
The cost of delivering finished
goods to our customers is recorded as a component of cost of sales. Those costs
include the amounts paid to a third party to deliver the finished goods. Any
freight costs billed to and paid by a customer are included in revenue.
Foreign Currency Translation
The income statements of foreign entities are
translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the
periods in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
SFAS, No52 Foreign Currency
Translation. The balance sheets of these entities are translated at
period-end  62  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS exchange rates, and the differences from historical
exchange rates are reflected in a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss as unrealized foreign currency translation
adjustments. Foreign currency gains and losses arising from settlement of
transactions in non-local currencies and remeasurement of non-local currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in other income
expense, net.
Foreign currency risks arise from transactions and
commitments denominated in non-local currencies. These transactions and
commitments may include the purchase of inventories or property, plant and
equipment, the sale of products and the repayment of loans. Such gains losses
included in other income expense, net were $11 million in 2004, $10
million in 2003 and $09 million in 2002.
We selectively hedge our foreign currency risks when
it is practicable and cost effective to do so. The instruments are purchased
from well-known money center banks, insurance companies or government agencies
counterparties. Usually the contracts extend for no more than 12 months,
although their contractual term has been as long as 24 months. Credit risks
with respect to the counterparties, and the foreign currency risks that would
not be hedged if the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations under the
contracts, are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties.
Gains and losses on instruments that hedge firm
commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying hedged
items. Premiums paid for options are amortized ratably over the life of the
option. All other gains and losses are included in period income or expense
based on the period-end market price of the instrument.
At December31, 2004,
there were outstanding forward contracts, which were held for purposes other
than trading, maturing at various dates in 2005, to purchase approximately $26
million of various foreign currencies. At December31, 2003, there were
outstanding forward contracts, which were held for purposes other than trading,
maturing at various dates in 2004, to purchase approximately $24 million of
various foreign currencies. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges
of foreign currency transactions to fix our local currency cash flow. These
contracts had not given rise to any significant net deferred gains or losses as
of December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, and their fair values
approximated their carrying value.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly
liquid, unrestricted investments with remaining maturities of 3 months or less
to be cash equivalents.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, using the
First-In, First-Out, or FIFO, and weighted average methods, or market. Our
inventoriable costs primarily include pulp, chemicals, direct labor, utilities,
maintenance, depreciation, finishing supplies and an allocation of mill
overhead costs. Machine start-up costs or abnormal machine shut downs are
expensed in the period incurred and are not inventoried. Market, with respect
to all inventories, is replacement cost or net realizable value. We review
inventories at least quarterly to determine the necessity of write-offs for excess,
obsolete or unsaleable inventory. We estimate reserves for inventory
obsolescence and shrinkage based on our judgment of future realization. These
reviews require us to assess customer and market demand.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures
for betterments are capitalized whereas normal repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred. Depreciable property is depreciated on the straight-line
method for financial reporting purposes. When property is sold or retired, the
cost of the property and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from
the balance sheet, and any gain or loss on the transaction is normally included
in cost of products sold. The depreciable lives for the principal asset
categories are as follows

2004, 2003 and 2002.
Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets
The Company accounts for
long-lived assets, other than goodwill with an indefinite useful life, in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. The carrying value of long-lived assets is
reviewed periodically to determine if events or circumstances have changed
which may indicate that the assets may be impaired or the useful life may need
to be changed. We consider internal and external factors relating to each
asset, including expectation of future profitability, undiscounted cash flow
and our plans with respect to the operations. SFAS No144 requires
impairment losses to be recognized for long-lived assets used in operations
when indicators of impairment are present and the estimated undiscounted cash
flows are not sufficient to recover the assets net carrying amounts. The
impairment loss is measured by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset,
usually based on discounted cash flows, to its net carrying amount.
Environmental Spending
Environmental spending is
capitalized if such spending qualifies as property, plant and equipment,
substantially increases the economic value or extends the useful life of an
asset. All other such spending is expensed as incurred, including fines and
penalties incurred in connection with environmental violations. Environmental
spending relating to an existing condition caused by past operations is
expensed. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments or remedial
efforts are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally,
timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or
commitment to a formal plan of action.

the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes over the estimated
useful life not to exceed 7 years. Costs associated with business process
redesign, end-user training, system start-up and ongoing software maintenance
are expensed as incurred. Amortization of capitalized software was $41
million, $36 million and $28 million for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002. 65  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets
Effective January1, 2002, we adopted SFAS, No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
eliminating the periodic charge to earnings for goodwill amortization for 2002
and future years. In addition, as required by SFAS No142, we are
required to perform a goodwill impairment test at least annually. Our most
recent impairment test was performed during the fourth quarter of 2004 and did
not result in an impairment charge. Goodwill is included in Other Assets on the
consolidated balance sheet for our 1998 acquisition in Brazil and our 2004
acquisition in Indonesia and consisted of the following dollars in millions

Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and
reporting for income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No109, deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between
the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will
result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws
and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to
affect taxable income. Income tax expense benefit is the tax payable or
refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in
deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In
assessing the likelihood of realization, we consider estimates of future
taxable income.
In France, SMF and its subsidiaries form a
consolidated income tax group, SMH and SMI form a separate consolidated income
tax group, while LTRI separately files its own income tax return. 66 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Comprehensive Income
We account for comprehensive income according to the
provisions of SFAS No130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income which establishes standards for reporting and
display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose
financial statements. Comprehensive income includes net income, as well as
charges and credits directly to stockholders equity, which are excluded from
net income. We have presented comprehensive income in the consolidated
statements of changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income.

Treasury Stock
Common stock purchased for
treasury is recorded at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury
stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on the weighted-average cost
basis.
Share-Based Incentive Compensation
SFAS No123 Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation defines a fair value based method of
accounting for stock compensation, including stock options, to employees. This
statement provides entities a choice of recognizing related compensation
expense by adopting the fair value method or to measure compensation using the
intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Bulletin, or APB, Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
We have elected to continue to measure compensation cost for stock compensation
based on the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No25. Payments in
the form of our shares made to third parties, including our outside directors,
are recorded at fair value based on the  67  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS market value of our common stock at the time of
payment. Under APB Opinion No25, because the exercise price of our
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. SFAS No123, as
amended by SFAS No148, Accounting
for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, requires
presentation of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had
accounted for our employee stock compensation under the fair value method of
that statement.
Fair
values of options granted are estimated as of the grant date using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following assumptions were used for
valuing options granted

Accounting Pronouncements
In December2004, Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, which
replaces SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No25. SFAS123R
requires the measurement of all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the
recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income. The
accounting provisions of SFAS123R are effective for reporting periods
beginning after June15, 2005. This statement requires companies to
calculate the fair value of stock options granted to employees, and amortize
that amount over the options vesting period as an expense through the income
statement. The pro forma
disclosures previously permitted under SFAS123 will no longer be an
alternative to financial statement recognition.  68  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS See Share-Based Incentive
Compensation above for the pro forma net income and net income per share
amounts for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004, where we used a fair-value-based
method under SFAS123 to measure compensation expense for employee stock
incentive awards. We are evaluating the requirements under
SFAS123R and expect to begin expensing stock options in the third quarter
of 2005, which is expected to increase 2005 non-cash operating expenses by
approximately $1 million, using similar assumptions and methodology as
disclosed above in Share-Based Incentive Compensation.
In December2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position No.FAS109-1, or FAS109-1, Application
of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax
Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act, or AJCA,
introduced a special 9 percent tax deduction on qualified production activities.
FAS109-1 clarified that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a
special tax deduction in accordance with SFAS No109 and not as a tax
rate change. We do not expect the adoption of this new tax provision to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.
In December2004, the
FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.FAS109-2, or FAS109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation
Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004. The AJCA
introduced a limited time 85 percent dividends received deduction on the
repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer, or Repatriation
Provision, provided certain criteria are met. FAS109-2 provides accounting and
disclosure guidance for the Repatriation Provision. Although FAS109-2 is
effective immediately, we do not expect to be able to complete our evaluation
of the Repatriation Provision until after Congress or the Treasury Department
provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. In January2005,
the Treasury Department began to issue the first of a series of clarifying
guidance documents related to this provision. We expect to complete our
evaluation of the effects of the Repatriation Provision during the second
quarter of 2005. The range of possible amounts that we are considering for
repatriation under this provision is between $0 and $30million. While we
estimate that the related potential range of additional income tax is between
$0 and $2million, this estimate is subject to change following technical
correction legislation that we believe is forthcoming from Congress. 69  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note

Credit Agreement
On January31, 2002, we entered into an unsecured
credit agreement with a group of banks, or the Credit Agreement, providing 5-year
and 364-day revolving loan facilities. Under the Credit Agreement, we and
SMF as of December31, 2004 had 5-year and 364-day revolving
loan facilities available totaling up to 62 million euros or $841 million
using the December31, 2004 currency exchange rate, or the Euro Credit
Facility, and we had 5-year and 364-day revolving loan facilities
available totaling up to $550 million, or the U.S. Credit Facility, and,
together with the Euro Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities.
As of December31, 2004, the Euro Credit Facility
consisted of a 5-year revolving credit facility in the amount of up to 50
million euros or $678 million using the December31, 2004 currency
exchange rate, or the 5-Year Euro Revolver, and a renewable 364-day
revolving credit facility in an amount of up to 12 million euros or $163
million using the December31, 2004 currency exchange rate, or the 364-Day
Euro Revolver. We guarantee borrowings by SMF under the Euro Credit Facility. We
also have the ability to borrow under the Euro Credit Facility although we do
not currently anticipate doing so.
As of December31, 2004, the U.S. Credit Facility
consisted of a 5-year revolving credit facility in the amount of up to
$450 million, or the 5-Year U.S. Revolver, and, together with the 5-Year
Euro Revolver, the 5-Year Revolvers, and a renewable 364-day
revolving credit facility available to us in an amount of up to $100 million,
or the 364-Day U.S. Revolver, and, together with the 364-Day Euro
Revolver, the 364-Day Revolvers. The terms of the Credit Agreement
provide us with flexibility to utilize cash balances to pay down the 5-Year
Revolvers and subsequently draw on those facilities again when needed.
On January26, 2005, we entered into Amendment No3
to the Credit Agreement. Under the Amendment, we renewed our 364-Day
Revolver, extending these facilities from January27, 2005 to January26,
2006. This Amendment also increased the amounts available to us under the 364-Day
U.S. Revolver from $100 million to $150 million and reduced the amount
available to us under the 364-Day Euro Revolver from 120
million to 
80 million. 70  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Under the Credit Agreement, the interest rate under
the 5-Year U.S. Revolver is the sum of aeither 070 percent per
annum or 080 percent per annum, or the Applicable Margin, determined by
reference to our Net Debt to Equity Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement,
plus bthe London interbank offered rate for U.S. dollar deposits, or
LIBOR. Under the Credit Agreement, the interest rate under the 5-Year
Euro Revolver is the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the euro zone interbank
offered rate for euro deposits, or EURIBOR. The interest rates under the U.S.
and Euro 364-Day Revolvers are determined using the same formula for the
respective 5-Year Revolvers except that the Applicable Margin is either
065 percent per annum or 075 percent per annum, determined by reference to
our Net Debt to Equity Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit
Agreement contains representations and warranties which are customary for
facilities of this type and covenants and provisions that, among other things,
require us to maintain certain defined financial ratios a minimum Tangible Net
Worth, a maximum Net Debt to Equity Ratio and a maximum Net Debt to Adjusted
EBITDA Ratio, all as defined in the Credit Agreement. At December31,
2004, our Tangible Net Worth was $572 million above the minimum permitted
amount while Net Debt was $567 million less than the maximum permitted amount
under the most restrictive covenant. We do not currently anticipate any change
in business conditions of a nature that would cause us to violate our covenants
under the Credit Agreement.
Interest Rate Hedge Agreements. We
selectively enter into interest rate hedge agreements with respect to our
variable rate long-term borrowings under our credit facilities to manage our
exposure to interest rate increases when it is practicable and cost-effective
to do so. During the first quarter of 2001,
we entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the variable rate
component of certain of our variable rate long-term debt. The combination of
these interest rate swap agreements began with a notional amount of $45
million, declining to $30 million effective January31, 2002, and
declining again to $15 million effective July31, 2002 through the
remainder of the contract terms ending January31, 2003. These interest
rate swap agreements fixed the LIBOR at 542 percent. This had the effect of
fixing our interest rate, including margin, at 572 percent on $45 million of
our debt through January31, 2002, 612 percent on $30 million of our debt
from February1, 2002 through July31, 2002, and 612 percent on $15
million of our debt from August1, 2002 through January31, 2003. Effective January31, 2003, we entered into
a 2-year interest rate swap agreement to fix the LIBOR rate
component of $15 million of our variable rate U.S. dollar long-term debt at
205 percent, which had the effect of fixing our interest rate, including
margin, at 275 percent on $15 million of our debt through January31,
2005. These interest rate swap contracts were designated as cash flow hedges
and we applied the short-cut method treatment under SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
As such, we assumed there was no ineffectiveness of these hedge contracts, and
accordingly, no gain or loss was recorded in the income statement relative to
the changes in fair value of these interest rate swap contracts, but instead
the changes in fair value of the contracts were reflected in other
comprehensive income loss. The fair value balance was $0 and $01 million
as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and was included in accumulated
other comprehensive loss, net of tax, on our consolidated balance sheet. We
have not entered into any other interest rate-related derivative contract
agreements during the years covered by these financial statements. The weighted
average effective interest rates on our 5-Year Revolvers were 24
percent, 25 percent and 53 percent for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
5-Year Revolvers. At
December31, 2004, we had $1128 million available on our 5-Year
Revolvers in the United States and France under the Credit Agreement, of which
$721 million was outstanding at December31, 2004. These facilities
permit borrowing at competitive interest rates and are available for  71  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS general corporate purposes. We pay commitment fees on the
unused portion of these 5-Year Revolvers at an annual rate of 035
percent and may cancel all or a portion of the unused facilities without
penalty at any time prior to their expiration.
364-Day
Revolvers. At December31, 2004, we had $263
million available on our 364-Day Revolvers in the United States and
France under the Credit Agreement, of which $163 million was unused. These
facilities permit borrowing at competitive interest rates and are available for
general corporate purposes. Effective January27, 2005, we renewed these
short-term facilities to January26, 2006. We pay commitment fees on the
unused portion of these 364-Day Revolvers at an annual rate of 025
percent and may cancel all or a portion of the unused facilities without
penalty at any time prior to their expiration.
French Employee Profit Sharing
At both December31,
2004 and 2003, long-term debt other than the 5-Year Revolvers primarily
consisted of obligations of the French operations related to
government-mandated profit sharing. Each year, representatives of the workers
at each of the French businesses can make an election for the profit sharing
amounts from the most recent year ended as to whether to invest the funds in a
financial institution or to invest the funds with their respective employer. To
the extent that funds are invested with us, these amounts bear interest at the 5-year
treasury note rate in France, 447 percent and 441 percent at December31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, and are generally payable in the fifth year
subsequent to the year the profit sharing is accrued.
Bank Overdraft and Other
We also had other uncommitted bank credit facilities,
or bank overdrafts, available totaling $336 million, of which $90 million was
outstanding at December31, 2004 and reported as current debt on the
consolidated balance sheet. No commitment fees are paid on the unused portion
of these facilities.
Other credit facilities
consist of French segment debt from governmental and professional institutions
primarily related to environmental capital improvements. This debt has deferred
capital repayment terms and interest rates of zero percent. 72  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Principal Repayment
Under
our Credit Agreement, we select an interest period for each of our borrowings
under our 5-Year Revolvers. Being a revolving credit arrangement, we can
repay such borrowings and borrow again at a subsequent date if we choose to do
so, providing us more flexibility and more efficient use of any excess cash
than was possible under our previous term loan arrangements. At year-end 2004,
we believed that we will repay the full amounts outstanding under our 5-Year
Euro Revolver during 2005 and therefore appropriately reflected those amounts
as current debt. While we have the ability to extend those borrowings beyond
2005 by filing notices of continuation, we do not expect to do so and therefore
expect the amounts to be due and payable during 2005 and expect to make such
repayments. By contrast, we expect to continue to file notices of continuation
related to our 5-Year U.S. Revolver borrowings outstanding at December31,
2004 such that those amounts are not expected to be repaid prior to the January31,
2007 expiration date of the Credit Agreement, and therefore presented those
obligations as expected to be repaid in 2007. Following are the expected
maturities for our debt obligations as of December31, 2004 dollars in

Fair Value of Debt
At December31, 2004
and 2003, the estimated fair value of our current and long-term debt
approximated the carrying amount. These fair values were based on quoted market
prices for the same or similar debt or on current rates offered to us for
obligations with the same maturities.

The comparison of our effective income tax rate in
2004 compared with 2003 was impacted by adjustments in 2004 to valuation
allowances recorded against deferred income tax assets as a result of
realization of foreign tax credit carryforwards utilized in our 2003 U.S.
federal income tax return and changes in our expectations as to the realization
of such assets due to changes in estimates of our U.S. income tax situation and
an increase in the carryforward period of foreign tax credits from 5 years to
10 years provided in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Additionally, we
recorded income tax benefits from a decrease in the French statutory corporate
income tax rate enacted in December2004, which decreased from 353
percent for 2004 to 348 percent in 2005 and to 343 percent in 2006 and
beyond, that reduced the net deferred income tax liability and from the
recovery of prior year taxes in France related to a favorable November2004
court ruling, which is described further on page77. The comparison of our effective income tax rate in
2003 compared with 2002 was impacted by net favorable deferred income tax
valuation allowance adjustments of $32 million in 2003 and $23 million in
2002. The valuation allowance adjustments in 2002 were recorded primarily as a
result of partial resolution of tax audits in our French operations, while the
valuation allowance adjustments in 2003 were recorded as a result of the final
settlement of tax audit assessments in France and by our improved ability to
utilize foreign tax credits in the United States. Our U.S. income tax situation
changed, in part, due to the effects of our having implemented certain tax
elections, including the conversion from LIFO to FIFO inventory valuation for
income tax purposes.
Included in the $35 million and $24 million
favorable effects of other foreign taxes, net in 2004 and 2003, respectively,
were net benefits of $30 million and $16 million, respectively, from
restructuring of our foreign operations implemented in the second quarter of
2003, which provides net foreign tax deductions for which income tax benefits
have been recognized.
We consider the undistributed earnings of certain
foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested or plan to repatriate such
earnings only when tax-effective to do so. Accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal and state income taxes has been made thereon. Upon distribution of
those earnings in the form of dividends,  74  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS loans to the U.S. parent, or otherwise, we could be
liable for both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax
credits and withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities. Determination
of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not practicable
because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

NOLs in Spain expire the later of 10 years subsequent to the year generated or
10 years subsequent to the first year of taxable income in Spain which was
2000. Of the $531 million of NOLs still available at December31, 2004 65 million, $11 million and $03 million will expire in 2010, 2012 and 2014,
respectively, if not utilized against taxable income in Spain. The remaining
$452 million of NOLs are in France and have no expiration date. Valuation
allowances related to NOLs in Spain totaled $28 million as of December31,
2004, fully reserving the related deferred tax asset in Spain and reducing the
net assets to zero, the amount which is estimated to be realizable through
utilization of the NOLs. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is
more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset of $155 million, all of
which relates to the NOLs in France, will be realized. However, that amount
could change if, among other considerations, estimates of future taxable income
or income tax regulations or interpretations change during the carryforward
periods.

76  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In addition to the NOLs above, we have generated
foreign tax credits in excess of the amount of foreign tax credits utilized in
our U.S. federal income tax returns, as well as federal research credits,
certain state credits, primarily for investments in fixed assets in those
states, and federal alternative minimum tax, or AMT, credits. The amount of
cumulative excess foreign tax credits, including estimates of credits expected
to be generated and utilized in 2004, totaled $24 million at December31,
2004. These credits now carryforward 10 years from the date generated based on
provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and because of this
extended carryforward period, from the previous 5 year limit, and the current
and forecasted profitability of our U.S. business operations, we currently
foresee being able to realize a financial benefit from a portion of these
foreign tax credits prior to their expiration. These assets were partially
reserved at December31, 2004 with a valuation allowance of $18 million. The
federal research credits and various U.S. state and Canadian provincial tax
credits are estimated to total $24 million as of December31, 2004, of
which we have estimated that $12 million of these credits will be realized
prior to their expiration and thus have a valuation allowance of $12 million
at December31, 2004. Our federal AMT credits, related to our filed 2003
and prior year tax returns and our estimated 2004 AMT, totaled $32 million at December31,
2004. These federal AMT credits carry forward indefinitely and no valuation
allowance has been recorded.
Along with numerous other
companies and banks in France, PdM was subject to a tax claim with respect to
its purchase of certain bonds in 1988 which were represented by 2 selling banks
as carrying specific tax benefits. The French taxing authority challenged the
use by PdM of those benefits. In 1997, PdM fully accrued the assessed principal
and interest following an unfavorable court decision and, while appealing the
court decision, subsequently paid the $06 million final assessment in 2001 so
that there was no remaining risk of penalties. In 2002, the French court
reached a decision that companies such as PdM could pursue claims against the
banks that sold the purportedly tax-advantaged bonds and subsequently PdM
submitted the necessary information to the court to pursue claims against the
selling banks, pending the outcome of PdMs appeal against the French taxing
authority. In November2004, the Cour Administrative dAppel de Nantes
rendered a favorable decision to PdM overturning the 2001 final assessment and
requiring refund of the principal and interest payments to PdM. Based on these
favorable decisions, during the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded an asset of
$10 million for the refund of taxes and interest awarded by the court.
Note
5 Postretirement and Other Benefits
North
American Pension and Postretirement Healthcare and Life Insurance Benefits
The U.S. segment has defined benefit retirement plans that
cover substantially all full-time employees. Retirement benefits are based on
either a cash balance benefit formula or a final average pay formula for
certain employees who were grandfathered and retained retirement benefits
under the terms of the plan prior to amendment of the plan to include a cash
balance benefit formula. For employees under the cash balance formula, we
annually credit to the employees account balance a retirement contribution
credit, which is a percentage of the employees earnings based on age and years
of vesting service in the plan, and an interest credit, based on the average
yield for 30-year treasury bills. For employees under the final average
pay formula, retirement benefits are based on years of service and generally on
the average compensation earned in the highest 5 of the last 15 years of
service. Our Canadian retirement benefit plan assets and liabilities are
immaterial and therefore are not included in the following disclosures. Our
U.S. employee pension plans accounted for approximately 70 percent of our total
pension plan assets and total accumulated benefit obligations, as of December31,
2004. 77 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of December 31, 2004, there were a total of 588
active employees covered by the plans final average pay benefit formula and
228 active employees covered by the plans cash balance benefit formula. There
were also a total of 240 plan participants collecting monthly benefits under
the plans final average pay benefit formula.
The. U.S. segment also has unfunded healthcare and
life insurance benefit plans which cover substantially all of our retirees.
Certain employees, who were grandfathered and retained benefits under the
terms of our plans prior to certain past amendments, receive retiree healthcare
coverage at rates we subsidize. For other eligible employees, retiree
healthcare coverage access is offered at full cost to the retiree. The
postretirement healthcare plans include a limit on our share of costs for
current and future retirees. Our retiree life insurance plans are
noncontributory. Our Canadian postretirement benefits liability is immaterial
and therefore is not included in the following disclosures.
We use
a measurement date of December31 for our pension and other postretirement
healthcare and life insurance benefit plans. The funded status of these U.S.
plans as of December31, 2004 and 2003 was as follows our postretirement

Assumptions
are used to determine our benefit obligations. The rate used to discount our
projected future benefit obligations back to a present value is called the
discount rate. The discount rate fluctuates from year to year based on current
market interest rates for high-quality fixed-income investments. We also
evaluate the expected average duration of our pension obligations in
determining our discount rate. Achange in the discount rate assumption of
025 percent would change our estimated 2005 U.S. pension expense by
approximately $03 million. An assumed long-term rate of compensation increase
is also used to determine the projected benefit obligations. The weighted
average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December31,
2004 and 2003 were as follows

A 1-percentage point increase or decrease in the

as well as the total postretirement benefit obligation, at December31,
2004.
In December2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Act, was enacted. The Act established
a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as Medicare PartD, and
a federal subsidy for sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that
provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare PartD.
We have concluded that the Act will not have a significant effect on the cost
of our postretirement medical plans. 79  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The

Assumptions
are used to determine net periodic benefit costs. In addition to the discount
rate and rate of compensation increase, which are used to determine benefit
obligations, an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is also used
to determine net periodic pension benefit costs. The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets is used to reduce the expected gross periodic cost of our
benefits by that amount expected to be earned on assets of the plan. The
expected long-term target rate of return on plan assets is based upon our
projected investment mix of plan assets, the assumption that future returns
will be close to the historical long-term rate of return experienced for equity
and fixed income securities and a 10 to 15 year investment horizon, so that
fluctuations in the interim should be viewed with appropriate perspective. A
change in the long-term rate of return assumption of 050 percent would change
our estimated 2005 U.S. pension expense by approximately $03 million. The
weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for

Our investment strategy
with respect to our U.S. pension plan assets is to maximize the return on
investment of plan assets at an acceptable level of risk and to assure the
plans fiscal health. The primary goal of our pension plans is to maintain the
highest probability of assuring future benefit payments to participants while
providing growth of capital in real terms. To achieve this goal, the investment
philosophy is to protect plan assets from large investment losses, particularly
over time, while growing the assets as fast as prudently possible. While there
cannot be complete assurance that the objectives will be realized, we believe
that the likelihood of realizing the objectives is reasonably high based upon
this investment philosophy. We have an investment committee that meets formally
on a periodic basis to review the 80  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS portfolio
returns and to determine asset mix targets. U.S. pension plan assets target
allocation by asset category for 2005 and actual allocation by asset category
at December31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows

None of our pension plan assets are targeted for investment in SWM stock,
except that it is possible that one or more mutual funds held by the plan could
hold shares of SWM.
We
expect the following estimated undiscounted future pension and postretirement
healthcare and life insurance benefit payments, which are to be made from both
pension plan and employer assets, net of amounts that will be funded from
retiree contributions, and which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate dollars in millions

Although we will not be
required to make cash contributions to our U.S. pension plan trust in 2005, we
currently expect to contribute approximately $8 million during 2005 in order to
help improve the funded status of these plans. We also expect to pay
approximately $14 million during 2005 to cover our U.S. postretirement
healthcare and life insurance benefit payments, as well as $01 million during
2005 to cover our supplemental employee retirement plan during the year.
French Pension Benefits In France, employees are covered under a
government-administered program. Also, our French operations sponsor retirement
indemnity plans, which pay a lump sum retirement benefit to all of our
permanent employees who retire. In addition, our French operations sponsor a
supplemental executive pension plan, which is designed to provide a retirement
benefit up to 65 percent of final earnings, depending upon years of service,
and the formula for which the employee is eligible. As of December31,
2004, there were a total of 178 active and 9 retired employees in the supplemental
executive pension plan. Plan assets are principally invested in the general
asset portfolio of a French insurance company. We currently expect to
contribute approximately $7 million to our French pension plans during 2005 in
order to help improve the funded status of these plans. 81  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We use
a measurement date of December31 for our French pension plans. The funded

Brazilian Pension Benefits
In Brazil, employees are
covered under a government-administered program.
Other Benefits
Substantially all of our U.S. employees have been
given the opportunity to participate in a voluntary retirement savings plan. Under
the plan, we match a portion of employee contributions. Employees may
reallocate their respective account balances, including any balances in our
common stock, amongst any number of the available investment choices under the
plan provisions on a daily basis. Our cost under the plan reflected in the
accompanying consolidated income statements was $10 million for 2004 and 2003
and $09 million for 2002. At December31, 2004 and 2003, 500,000 shares
of our common stock were reserved for issuance under the plan, none of which
had been issued as of December31, 2004. The shares may, at our option, be
used to satisfy our liability for matching contributions.
We also provide U.S. executives, certain other key
personnel and our directors the opportunity to participate in deferred
compensation plans. Those participating employees can elect to defer a portion
of their salaries and certain other compensation. Those participating directors
can elect to defer their meeting fees, as a cash deferral, as well as their
quarterly retainer fees, as deferred stock unit credits. Our liability balance
under these plans totaled $35 million and $24 million at December31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, which is included on the consolidated balance
sheet in Other Liabilities. In connection with these plans, as well as our
supplemental retirement and severance plans, we have a grantor trust into which 83  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS we have contributed funds toward our future
obligations under the various plans. Grantor trust investments are primarily in
company-owned life insurance policies. The balance of grantor trust assets
totaled $32 million and $22 million at December31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, which is included in Other Assets on the consolidated balance
sheet.
In accordance with French
law, certain salaried employees in France may accumulate unused regular
vacation and supplemental hours of paid leave that can be credited to an
individuals Compte Epargne Temps, or CET. The CET account may grow over an
individuals career and the hours accumulated may be withdrawn upon retirement
or under other special circumstances at the individuals then current rate of
pay. The balance of our liability for this program reflected in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet in Other Liabilities was $51 million
and $45 million at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Note 6 Stockholders Equity
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the
issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $010 per
share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $010 per share. Each
share of outstanding common stock and common stock issued after the date of
this report will have attached to it, 1 right to purchase from us one
one-hundredth 1/100 of a share of a series of preferred stock designated as
the SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or the SeriesA
Preferred Stock, or a Right. Each Right entitles a shareholder to purchase from
us one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share of the SeriesA Preferred Stock at
a price of $65 per one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share, subject to certain
anti-dilution adjustments. The Rights, however, become exercisable only at such
time as a person or group acquires, or commences a public tender or exchange
offer for, 15 percent or more of our common stock. The Rights have certain
anti-takeover effects since they may cause substantial dilution to a person or
group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of
Directors. The Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business
combination approved by the Board of Directors since we may redeem them at
$001 per Right at any time until a person or group has obtained beneficial
ownership of 15 percent or more of the voting stock. The Rights will expire October1,
2010, unless redeemed earlier by us.
The SeriesA
Preferred Stock will be non-redeemable and, unless otherwise provided in
connection with the creation of a subsequent series of preferred stock, will be
subordinate to any other series of our preferred stock. Each share of SeriesA
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive when, as and if declared, a
quarterly dividend in an amount equal to the greater of $1 per share or 100
times the cash dividends declared on our common stock. In addition, the SeriesA
Preferred Stock is entitled to 100 times any non-cash dividends other than
dividends payable in shares of common stock or a subdivision of the outstanding
shares of common stock declared on the common stock, in like kind. In the
event of liquidation, the holders of the SeriesA Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive a liquidation payment in an amount equal to the greater of
$100 per share or 100 times the payment made per share of common stock. Each
share of SeriesA Preferred Stock will have 100 votes, voting together
with the common stock. In the event of any merger, consolidation or other
transaction in which common shares are exchanged, each share of SeriesA
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per
share of common stock. The rights of the SeriesA Preferred Stock as to
dividends, liquidation and voting are protected by antidilution provisions. 84  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Equity Participation Plan
Our Equity Participation Plan provides that eligible
employees may be granted stock options which, when exercised, give the
recipient the right to purchase our common stock at a price no less than the fair
market value as defined in the Equity Participation Plan of such stock at
grant date. Options awarded under the Equity Participation Plan only become
exercisable after specified periods of employment after the grant thereof 30
percent after the first year, 30 percent after the second year and the
remaining 40 percent after the third year. Generally, such options expire 10
years subsequent to the date of grant. At December31, 2004, 2,235,000
shares of our common stock were reserved under the Equity Participation Plan. At
December31, 2004, there were 242,060 shares available for future awards.

85  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Restricted Stock
Plan
Effective December1999,
we established a Restricted Stock Plan which is intended to promote our
long-term financial success by attracting and retaining outstanding executive
personnel and to motivate such personnel by means of restricted stock grants. The
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors selects participants and
establishes the terms of any grant of restricted stock. Our Restricted Stock
Plan provides that such a grant immediately transfers ownership rights in
shares of our common stock to the recipient of the grant, including the right
to vote the shares and to receive dividends thereon, at a share price
established by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. The recipients
continued ownership of and right to freely transfer the restricted stock is
subject to such conditions on transferability and to such risks of forfeiture
as are established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, which
may include continued employment with us for a defined period, achievement of
specified management performance objectives or other conditions established by
the Compensation Committee. The number of shares, which may be issued under
this Restricted Stock Plan, is limited to the lesser of 1,000,000 shares or the
number of treasury shares held by us as of the date of any grant. No single
participant may be awarded, in the aggregate, more than 50 percent of the
shares authorized to be issued under the Restricted Stock Plan. As of December31,
2004, 84,000 restricted shares had been issued under the Restricted Stock Plan
most of which do not vest until 4 years of service from the date of the grant. As
of December31, 2004, 54,000 shares of issued restricted stock were not
yet vested. The number of shares available for future awards is limited, as of December31,
2004, to 916,000.

and Contingencies
Leases
Future minimum obligations
under non-cancelable operating leases having an initial or remaining term in
excess of one year as of December31, 2004 are less than $14 million
annually over the next 5 years and thereafter. Rental expense under operating
leases was $49 million for 2004 and $43 million for both 2003 and 2002.
Other Commitments
A vendor of PdM operates a calcium carbonate plant
on-site at the Quimperle, France mill. Under the terms of the agreement, which
is currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2009, the annual minimum
contractual commitment is at a quantity and price which would require $32
million of calcium carbonate purchases. Under this agreement, the net raw
material price expected to be paid is less than the net price at which the raw
material could otherwise be purchased, and thus the commitment is not expected
to result in a loss. Our purchases for the
mill in Quimperle were less than the minimum annual commitment level during
2002, which resulted in a dispute over invoice prices. PdM undertook efforts to
mitigate the issues associated with the use of the slurry-form calcium
carbonate, which is produced at the plant, such that PdM purchased the minimum
annual commitment in 2003 and 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, a
tentative agreement was reached with this vendor. This tentative agreement
resolves disputed invoices regarding prior year per unit prices of calcium
carbonate and extends the current agreement for an additional 5 years beyond
the current 2009 expiration.
We enter into certain other immaterial contracts from
time to time for the purchase of certain raw materials. We also enter into
certain contracts for the purchase of equipment and related costs in connection
with our ongoing capital projects, which, at December31, 2004, totaled
$19 million.
We operate at our Lee Mills facility a machine that is
owned by Kimberly-Clark. Ownership of the machine was retained by
Kimberly-Clark in the 1995 spin-off of Schweitzer-Mauduit, International,Inc.
as it operates solely for the purpose of producing a proprietary product used
as an in-process material by Kimberly-Clark. Under the contract for our
continued operation, the current term of which is scheduled to expire in December2009,
we essentially invoice Kimberly-Clark the actual costs of operating the
machine, including allocations of indirect and fixed overhead costs. While
certain of such costs could be eliminated if the contract is not renewed or is
otherwise terminated, we may be unable to eliminate a portion of the
approximately $2 million of indirect and fixed overhead costs that are
currently absorbed by that operation.
As of December31,
2004, we had issued guarantee instruments in connection with certain agreements
and as required by regulatory agencies in connection with certain of our
ongoing obligations, as follows: iWe issued a surety bond to the State
of Massachusetts beginning in 1998 in the principal amount of $15million
related to our ongoing obligation for post-closure monitoring and maintenance
of a landfill site. This surety bond has been replaced with a letter of credit
for the same principal amount effective April2003. We have a liability
recorded at December31, 2004 of $04 million based on our current
estimate of the remaining costs to perform such post-closure care. iiSince
1995, we have issued an annual letter of credit to an insurance company, the
current principal amount of which was $12 million as of December31,
2004, in connection with our administration of our workers compensation claims
in the United States, for which we have recorded a liability of $12 million at
December31, 2004. iiiWe began issuing a letter of credit to the
Township of East Brunswick, New Jersey beginning in 1988, the current  87  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS principal amount of which
was $05 million as of December31, 2004, in connection with our long-term
obligation related to the municipalitys recovery of the cost of installation
of a water line to our Spotswood mill, for which we have a recorded liability
of $05 million at December31, 2004. ivWe have certain other
letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding at December31, 2004, which
are not material either individually or in the aggregate.
Litigation
Imposto sobre
Circulao de Mercadorias e Servios Matter
Imposto sobre Circulao de Mercadorias e Servios, or
ICMS, a form of value-added tax in Brazil, was assessed to SWM-B in Decemberof
2000. SWM-B received 2 assessments from the tax authorities of the State of Rio
de Janeiro for unpaid ICMS taxes from January1995 through November2000,
which together with interest and penalties totaled approximately $136 million
based on the foreign currency exchange rate at December31, 2000,
collectively the Assessment.
The Assessment concerned the accrual and use by SWM-B
of ICMS tax credits generated from the production and sale of certain
non-tobacco related grades of paper sold domestically that are immune from the
tax to offset ICMS taxes otherwise owed on the sale of products that are not
immune. One of the 2 assessments, estimated at December31, 2000 at
approximately $91 million, related in part to tax periods that predated our
acquisition of Pirahy and is covered in part by an indemnification from the
sellers of Pirahy, or Assessment 1. The second assessment pertains exclusively
to periods that SWM-B owned the Pirahy mill, or Assessment 2. While SWM-B is
primarily responsible for the full payment of the Assessment in the event of an
ultimate unfavorable outcome, SWM-B is not aware of any difficulties that would
be encountered in obtaining reimbursement of that portion of any payment
resulting from Assessment 1 from the previous owner under the indemnification.
SWM-B contests the Assessment based on Article150,
VI of the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988, which grants immunity from
ICMS taxes to papers used in the production of books, newspapers and
periodicals, or immune papers, and the raw material inputs used to produce
immune papers. SWM-B further contends that the statutory provision relied on by
the State of Rio de Janeiro to argue that ICMS tax credits generated in the
course of the production of immune papers must be reversed rather than applied
to other ICMS taxes owed violates the Brazilian Federal Constitution and the
legal principle of non-cumulativity for ICMS tax set forth in Article155,
Section2,II, of the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988. Additionally,
SWM-B contends that the statutory provisions relied on by the government do not
address immunity from the incidence of the ICMS tax, but are addressed to exception
from the tax. This distinction is central to SWM-Bs further contention that
the only exceptions permitted to the constitutionally mandated principle of
non-cumulativity are for exemptions from tax and no exceptions from this
principle are permitted in cases of immunity from tax.
The State of Rio de Janeiro tax authorities, based on
appeals of the Assessment, reduced the original amount of Assessment 1 by
approximately $16 million and denied our appeal of Assessment 2. Following
these decisions at the administrative level, judicial actions captioned
Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil S.A. vs State of Rio de Janeiro were filed in the
Judiciary Branch of the 11th Public Treasury Court of the State of
Rio de Janeiro to annul the tax and to enjoin enforcement pending final
adjudication of the Assessment. The courts issued injunctions, which were
upheld on appeal, against enforcement of the Assessment without the requirement
for any bond or posting of other collateral by SWM-B, pending final
determination of SWM-Bs action to annul the tax debits. 88  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In Augustand November2003, the judges
hearing the challenges in the State of Rio de Janeiro ruled in SWM-Bs favor in
its suits to vacate Assessment 2 and Assessment 1, respectively, affirming the
bases of SWM-Bs legal challenges of the Assessment. The State of Rio de
Janeiro automatically appealed these favorable decisions. On May4, 2004,
the 1st Civil Chamber of the Court of Appeals of the State of Rio de
Janeiro entered an order, published on June7, 2004, granting the State of
Rio de Janeiros appeal of the lower courts decision annulling Assessment 2
against SWM-B. The appellate court reached its decision based on a majority
vote of the 3-judge panel, with 1 judge issuing a written dissenting
opinion. In June2004, SWM-B filed a motion and supporting brief with the
appellate court for a rehearing en banc. On August24 2004, the 9th Civil
Chamber of the Court of Appeals of the State of Rio de Janeiro entered an
order, published on October29, 2004, denying the State of Rio de Janeiros
appeal of the lower courts decision annulling Assessment 1 against SWM-B. The
State of Rio de Janeiro automatically appealed
this favorable decision. SWM-B continues to vigorously contest the Assessment
and believes that the Assessment will ultimately be resolved in its favor. However,
the final resolution of this matter may entail judicial proceedings up to and
including presentation of the matter to the Supreme Court of Brazil and is not
likely to be finally resolved for several years. Based on the foreign currency
exchange rate at December31, 2004, the Assessment, as reduced in August2001,
totaled approximately $140 million as of December31, 2004, of which
approximately $64 million is covered by the above-discussed indemnification. No
liability has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements for the
Assessment based on our evaluation that SWM-B is more likely than not to
prevail in its challenge of the Assessment under the facts and law as presently
understood.
In February2004,
SWM-B filed suit against the State of Rio de Janeiro to recover ICMS credits
previously reversed in 2000 following receipt of the Assessment. After the
Assessment was filed against us, SWM-B changed its procedures and did not
utilize ICMS tax credits through the end of production and sale of immune
papers during 2001. As a result of having received the Augustand November2003
favorable lower court rulings to the above Assessment 2 and Assessment 1,
respectively, SWM-B petitioned the court for permission to offset overpaid ICMS
taxes against current tax liabilities. SWM-B believes it has a reasonable
chance of success in this case. The amount of the claim totals approximately
$15 million, based on the foreign currency exchange rate at December31,
2004. During March2004, the court rejected SWM-Bs claim, which decision
SWM-B has appealed. As of December31, 2004, no asset has been recorded
for this potential recovery.
Indemnification Matters
In connection with our
spin-off from Kimberly-Clark in 1995 and pursuant to the resulting Transfer,
Contribution and Assumption Agreement and the related Distribution Agreement
between us and Kimberly-Clark dated October23, 1995, we undertook to
indemnify and hold Kimberly-Clark harmless from claims and liabilities related
to the businesses transferred to us that were not identified as excluded
liabilities in the above-mentioned agreements. To date, no claims which we deem
material to our financial condition or results of operations have been tendered
to us under this indemnification that have not been previously disclosed. As of
the date of these financial statements, there are no claims pending under this
indemnification that we deem to be material. 89 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
General Matters
We are involved in certain
other legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Management
believes that such litigation and claims will be resolved without a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local
laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental matters. The
nature of our operations expose us to the risk of claims with respect to
environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or
liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. While we have
incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and
operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and
regulations, we believe that our future cost of compliance with environmental
laws, regulations and ordinances, and our exposure to liability for
environmental claims and our obligation to participate in the remediation and
monitoring of certain hazardous waste disposal sites, will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However,
future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or unknown
contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us
including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or
other waste generators may give rise to additional costs which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
We incur spending
necessary to meet legal requirements and otherwise relating to the protection
of the environment at our facilities in the United States, France, Brazil,
Indonesia and Canada. For these purposes, we incurred total capital
expenditures of $21 million in 2004, and anticipate that we will incur
approximately $1 million in both 2005 and 2006, of which no material amount is
the result of environmental fines or settlements. The foregoing capital
expenditures are not expected to reduce our ability to invest in other
appropriate and necessary capital projects and are not expected to have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Note 8 Segment Information
General Information
We operate and manage our business based on the
geographical location of our primary manufacturing operations: the United
States, France and Brazil. These business segments manufacture and sell
cigarette, plug wrap and tipping papers, used to wrap various parts of a
cigarette, reconstituted tobacco products and paper products used in cigarette
packaging. While the products are similar in each segment, they vary based on
customer requirements and the manufacturing capabilities of each location. Sales
by a segment into markets primarily served by a different segment occur where
specific product needs cannot be cost-effectively met by the manufacturing
operations domiciled in that segment.
Tobacco industry products
comprised 93 percent of our consolidated net sales in the periods presented. The
non-tobacco industry products are a diverse mix of products, certain of which
represent commodity paper grades produced to maximize machine operations.
Information
about Sales, Profit and Assets
The accounting policies of the operating segments are
the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies
see Note 2. We primarily evaluate segment performance and allocate  90  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS resources based on operating profit loss that
represents revenue less operating and nonmanufacturing expenses.
For purposes of the segment disclosure in the
following tables, the term United States includes operations in the United
States and Canada. The Canadian operations only produce flax fiber used as a
raw material in the U.S. operations. The term France includes operations in
France and Indonesia beginning in 2004 because the results of the Indonesian
operation, which was acquired in February2004, are not material for
segment reporting purposes and since sales of the Indonesian business are primarily
of product sold under a trademark of one of our French businesses and are
coordinated with sales of our French operations in southeast Asia. Sales of
products between segments are made at market prices and elimination of these
sales are referred to in the following tables as intersegment sales. Expense
amounts not associated with segments are referred to as unallocated expenses. Assets
reported by segment represent assets which are directly used by that segment. Unallocated
items and eliminations, net include immaterial balances of our holding company
in Spain.

Note 9 Major Customers
Two of our customers have accounted for a significant
portion of our net sales in the periods presented in the financial statements,
and the loss of one or both such customers, or a significant reduction in one
or both of these customers purchases, could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations. Net sales to Philip Morris Incorporated, or Philip
Morris, together with its affiliates and designated converters, accounted for
30 percent of total consolidated net sales for the years ended December31,
2004 and 2003 and 28 percent for the year ended December31, 2002. Net
sales to B.A.T. Industries PLC, or BAT, together with its affiliates and
designated converters, accounted for 18 percent of consolidated net sales for
the year ended December31, 2004 and 19 percent for each of the years
ended December31, 2003 and 2002. Each of our segments reported sales to
these customers for each of the respective periods reported above.
We had sales to the minority shareholder of LTRI of
$286 million, $233 million and $180 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.
Our consolidated accounts receivable at December31,
2004 and 2003 included balances from Philip Morris and BAT, together with their
respective affiliates and designated converters. The percentage of these
customers balances of consolidated accounts receivable is less than each of
their respective percentages of consolidated net sales.
We perform ongoing credit
evaluations on all of our customers financial condition and generally do not
require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. A
substantial portion of our consolidated accounts receivable are due from
companies in the tobacco industry which has been and continues to be under
substantial pressure from legal, regulatory and tax developments. It is not
possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse
developments in pending or future litigation, regulatory actions and additional
taxes may have on the tobacco industry, its financial liquidity or
relationships with its suppliers. Nor is it possible to predict what additional
legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted, or to
what extent, if any, such legislation or regulations might affect the tobacco
products industry in general. 92  SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 10 Supplemental Disclosures
