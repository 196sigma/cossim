Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Micromuse Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company develops, markets and
supports a family of scaleable, highly configurable, rapidly deployable software
solutions for the effective monitoring and management of multiple elements
underlying an enterprise information technology infrastructure. The Company
maintains its U.S. headquarters in California and its European headquarters in
London, England.
Micromuse plc was incorporated in England in 1989 and operated in the United
States through its subsidiary, Micromuse USA Inc., a Texas corporation. In 1997,
Micromuse plc became a subsidiary of Micromuse Inc., a Delaware corporation. The
Company entered into a stock exchange agreement with the stockholders of the
English corporation in March 1997. The Company Board of Directors approved an
exchange of one share in the English corporation for 59365 shares in the
Delaware corporation. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Delaware
corporation authorized 600 million shares of common stock at $001 par value
per share and approximately 60 million shares of preferred stock at $001 par
value per share. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
retroactively restated to give effect to the reorganization and exchange of
common stock.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a purchased maturity of
90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to credit risk consist
of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. At September
30, 1999, the Company had investments in excess of insured amounts of
approximately $340 million. Trade receivables potentially subject the Company
to concentrations of credit risk. The Company closely monitors extensions of
credit and has not experienced significant credit losses in the past. Credit
losses have been provided for in the consolidated financial statements and have
been within management expectations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable
and accounts payable approximates their respective carrying amounts defined as
the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between willing parties.                    31 Investments
The Company has invested in certain marketable securities that are categorized
as held-to-maturity. At September 30, 1999, the Company had invested $183
million in cash and money market funds, $136 million in debt securities issued
by U.S. government corporations and agencies and $378 million in equity
securities. The aggregate fair value of these investments, which are accounted
for using the amortized cost-basis of accounting, approximates their respective
carrying value defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
in a current transaction between willing parties. Securities with maturities
between three and twelve months are considered to be short-term investments,
while securities with maturities in excess of twelve months are considered to be
long-term investments.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, typically three years for equipment and furniture.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful
lives of the respective assets or the lease term.
Revenue Recognition
License revenues are recognized upon the acceptance of a purchase order and
shipment of the software provided that the fee is fixed and determinable, the
arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software and
collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Allowances for credit losses
and for estimated future returns are provided for upon shipment. Credit losses
and returns to date have not been material. Maintenance revenues from ongoing
customer support and product upgrades are deferred and recognized ratably over
the term of the maintenance agreement, typically twelve months. Payments for
maintenance fees on initial order or on renewal are generally made in advance
and are nonrefundable. Revenues for consulting and training services are
recognized as the services are performed. In October 1997, the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position No. 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2. SOP 97-2 generally requires revenue
earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements, such as software
products, upgrades, enhancements, post-contract customer support, installation
and training, to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value
of the elements. The fair value of an element must be based on evidence that is
specific to the vendor. The revenue allocated to software products, including
specified upgrades or enhancements, generally is recognized upon delivery of the
products. The revenue allocated to post-contract customer support generally is
recognized ratably over the term of the support, and revenue allocated to
service elements generally is recognized as the services are performed. If
evidence of the fair value for all element arrangement does not exist, all
revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such evidence exists or until all
elements are delivered. SOP 97-2 was adopted effective October 1, 1997. There
was no material change to the Company accounting for revenue as a result of
the adoption of SOP 97-2.
Research and Development Cost
Development costs related to software products are expensed as incurred until
the technological feasibility of the product has been established. Technological
feasibility in the Company circumstances occurs when a working model is
completed. After technological feasibility is established, additional costs
would be capitalized. The Company believes its process for developing software
is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological
feasibility, and, accordingly, no research and development costs have been
capitalized to date.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if
necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits that are not expected
to be realized.                    32 Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation arrangements using the
intrinsic value method. As such, compensation expense is recorded when on the
date of grant the fair value of the underlying common stock exceeds the exercise
price for stock options or the purchase price for issuance or sales of common
stock.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company foreign subsidiaries is the local
currency. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign
subsidiaries to U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of
the year. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange
for the year. Translation adjustments and the effects of exchange rate changes
on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature are included in
stockholders' equity deficit in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and
losses resulting from foreign currency transactions denominated in a currency
other than the functional currency are included in income and have not been
significant to the Company consolidated operating results in any year.
Per Share Data
Basic per share amounts are calculated using the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted per share amounts are
calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the period and, when dilutive, the weighted-average number of potential common
shares from the assumed conversion of the redeemable convertible preferred stock
and the exercise of outstanding options to purchase common stock using the
treasury stock method. Excluded from the computation of the diluted loss per
share for the years ended September 30, 1998 and 1997 were approximately 45
million shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock and options to acquire
15 million and 13 million shares of common stock, respectively, with a
weighted-average exercise price of $478 and $238 per share, respectively,
because their effect would be anti-dilutive. A reconciliation of the numerators
and denominators used in the basic and diluted net income loss per share
amounts for fiscal 1999 follows                            Year ended September 30,

Comprehensive Income Loss
Effective October 1, 1998, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting
Standards Board the FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS 130. SFAS 130
establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income
loss and its components; however, the adoption of SFAS 130 had no impact on
our net income loss or stockholders' equity. This Statement requires foreign
currency translation adjustments, which prior to adoption were reported
separately in stockholders' equity deficit, to be included in other
comprehensive income loss. Prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the requirements of SFAS 130.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 addresses the accounting for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts. Under SFAS                    33 No. 133, entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the
balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as
part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it. The
Company must adopt SFAS No. 133 by October 1, 2001. The Company does not
anticipate that SFAS No. 133 will have an effect on its financial statements.
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
Statement of Position No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1. This SOP applies to
software that is acquired or developed solely for an entity internal use and
requires the capitalization of qualifying costs in software application
development activities, which include design, coding, installation hardware and
testing. Capitalization of qualifying costs incurred in development stage
activities begins when the entity has committed to fund a particular internal
computer software project and the entity considers it probable that the
committed software will be used to perform the intended function, provided that
the entity has completed the preliminary project stage activities. Preliminary
project stage activities include the conceptual formulation and evaluation of
alternatives and the determination of the existence of needed technology.
Qualifying capitalizable computer software costs include the external direct
costs of materials and services and the payroll related costs of employees who
are directly involved with the internal project. All other costs related to the
project are expensed as incurred.
SOP 98-1 will be effective for internal use computer software costs incurred in
future years commencing with our fiscal year beginning October 1, 1999. The
Company has followed an accounting policy of expensing as incurred all costs
related to software developed for internal use and intends to continue this
policy until the effective date of SOP 98-1. The Company has not yet determined
whether the adoption of SOP 98-1 will have a material effect on our financial
position or results of operations.
In December 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
Statement of Position No. 98-9, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to
Certain Arrangements SOP 98-9, which requires the recognition of revenue
using the residual method in a multiple element arrangement when fair value
does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement.
Under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements is
deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2. The Company
will adopt SOP 98-9 by October 1, 1999 and does not expect a material change to
its accounting for revenues as a result of the provisions of SOP 98-9.
Note 2. Discontinued Operations
In July 1997, the Company adopted a formal plan to discontinue its Systems
Integration division based in England. In September 1997, the Company sold the
division for approximately $400,000 in cash, net of fees. The disposition of the
division has been accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with
APB Opinion No. 30 and prior period consolidated financial statements have been
restated to reflect the discontinuation of the Systems Integration business.
Revenues from discontinued operations were $157 million in fiscal 1997. The
loss from discontinued operations of $104,000 in fiscal 1997 represents the
operation operating loss. The gain on disposal of discontinued operations of
$12 million in fiscal 1997 represents the gain on disposal of the operation
including net income from operations of $256,000 from the measurement date to
the disposal date.

In July 1997, the Company repurchased, from a stockholder who was an officer and
a director, 120,000 shares of common stock at $250 per share for a total price
of $300,000.
In November 1997, the Company repurchased, from a stockholder who was an officer
and a director, 777,605 shares of common stock at $643 per share for a total
price of $50 million. The stockholder used a portion of the proceeds to repay
an interest-free loan from the Company.
Note 5. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders' Equity
Deficit
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
A $30 million line of credit was made available to the Company in March 1997.
Interest under the line of credit was at no more than prime plus 2% and funds
drawn were to be used to finance an acquisition or other vehicle of growth as
approved by the Board of Directors. The $30 million line of credit was
available as of September 30, 1997. If exercised, the line of credit became due
and payable upon the earliest of a qualified public offering, a qualified
acquisition, or expiration of the Series A warrant issued in conjunction with
the line of credit. During fiscal 1997, the Company drew down $10 million,
which was repaid as of September 30, 1997. The warrant expired on the earlier of
March 2002, or the closing date of a public offering, merger, or acquisition of
the Company. The warrant issued in conjunction with the line of credit allowed
the holder to purchase 15 million shares of the Series A preferred stock at an
exercise price of $200 per share. The warrant was initially recorded at fair
value of $14 million, which was included in the carrying value of the Series A
preferred stock and treated as a debt issuance cost. This cost was amortized to
interest expense over the period from the date of issuance to the anticipated
date of the initial public offering, which resulted in a non-cash interest
charge of $300,000 and $11 million in fiscal 1998 and 1997, respectively. Under
the terms of the initial public offering, all the outstanding shares of Series B
and Series C preferred stock were converted into 20 million shares and 24
million shares of common stock, respectively, upon the closing of the IPO. In
addition, a warrant to purchase Series A preferred stock was converted into 15
million shares of common stock.
Common Stock
In March 1997, approximately 450,000 shares of common stock were issued to
stockholders as bonuses. The Company recorded compensation expense of
approximately $11 million for the fair market value of such shares. During
fiscal 1997, the principal stockholders transferred shares of common stock to
certain employees. The Company recorded compensation expense of $210,000 for the
difference between the fair market value and the transfer price of the common
stock.
In February 1998, the Company raised $342 million of net proceeds from the sale
of 32 million shares of the Company common stock pursuant to its IPO.
In July 1998, the Company raised $229 million of net proceeds from the sale of
10 million shares of the Company common stock pursuant to a follow-on public
offering.
Treasury Stock
In July 1997, the Company repurchased, from a stockholder who is an officer and
a director, 120,000 shares of common stock at $250 per share for a total price
of $300,000.
In November 1997, the Company repurchased, from a stockholder who is an officer
and a director, 777,605 shares of common stock at $643 per share for a total
price of $50 million. The stockholder used a portion of the proceeds to repay
an interest-free loan from the Company.
In October 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15
million shares, or approximately 9% of our outstanding common stock. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company had repurchased 05 million shares of its
outstanding common stock for approximately $95 million pursuant to the
repurchase program. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and are
available for                    35 general corporate purposes including issuance under our stock option and
employee stock purchase plans. In January 1999, the Company announced the
termination of the repurchase program. As of September 30, 1999, all the shares
of treasury stock had been reissued.
Stock Option Plan
Under the Company 1997 and 1998 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plans the
Plans, options to purchase shares of common stock may be granted to
employees, officers, directors and consultants officers and directors are not
eligible for grants under the 1998 Plan. Because the warrant to purchase 15
million shares of Series A was exercised upon the IPO, options to purchase an
additional 166,666 shares of common stock were reserved under the Plans. The
Plans provides for the issuance of incentive and non-statutory options that must
be granted at an exercise price not less than 100% and 85% of the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant, respectively 110% if the person
to whom the option is granted is a 10% stockholder. Incentive options may only
be granted to employees under the 1997 Plan. Options generally vest over four
years from the date of grant. The options expire between five and ten years from
the grant date, and any vested options must normally be exercised within three
months after termination of employment. The Plans are administered by the
Company Board of Directors and its Compensation Committee.

36 The Company uses the intrinsic value-based method to account for all of its
employee stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for its stock options in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements because the fair value of the underlying common stock equals or
exceeds the exercise price of the stock options at the date of grant, except
with respect to certain options issued in 1996 and during fiscal 1997. The
Company has recorded deferred stock compensation expense of $167,000 and
$229,000 for the difference at the grant date between the exercise price and the
fair value of the common stock underlying the options issued in September 1996
and fiscal 1997, respectively. The $167,000 was amortized in fiscal 1996 as the
options were fully vested upon issuance and $14,000, $56,000 and $56,000 of the
$229,000 was amortized in fiscal 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively, as the
options vest over four years.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock options been determined in a
manner consistent with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
the Company fiscal 1999 net income would have decreased by $47 million while
the fiscal 1998 and 1997 net loss would have increased by $733,000 and $47,000,
respectively, and the diluted earnings loss per share would have been $018 025 and $136 for fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during 1999,
1998 and 1997 was $1587, $676 and $067, respectively, on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes pricing model for fiscal 1999 and 1998 and the minimum
value method for fiscal 1997, with the following weighted assumptions: 1999 expected dividend yield of 00%, risk-free interest rate of 58%, expected
volatility of 70%, expected forfeiture rate of 30% and expected life of four
years; 1998 -- expected dividend yield of 00%, risk-free interest rate of 56 expected volatility of 80%, expected forfeiture rate of 25% and expected life of
four years; 1997 -- expected dividend yield of 00%, risk-free interest rate of
628%, and expected life of three years.
The per share weighted-average fair values of Employee Stock Purchase Plan
shares granted during fiscal 1999 and 1998 were $641 and $488, respectively,
calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted
assumptions: 1999 - expected dividend yield of 00%, risk-free interest rate of
53%, expected volatility of 70%, and expected life of 05 years; 1998 expected
dividend yield of 00%, risk-free interest rate of 52%, expected volatility of
80%, and expected life of 05 years.
In July 1997, 120,000 shares were issued to two directors at $250 per share,
under the 1997 Plan. The Company has recorded stock compensation expense of
$120,000, for the difference between the issuance price and the fair market
value of the common stock.
1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In January 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Company 1998 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP to provide employees of the Company with an
opportunity to purchase common stock through payroll deductions. Under the ESPP
300,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance as of September
30, 1999. The ESPP became effective at the time of the IPO. All full-time
regular employees who are employed by the Company are eligible to participate in
the.
Eligible employees may contribute up to 15% of their total cash compensation to
the ESPP. Amounts withheld are applied at the end of every six-month
accumulation period to purchase shares of common stock, but not more than 1,250
shares per accumulation period. The value of the common stock determined as of
the beginning of the offering period that may be purchased by any participant
in a calendar year is limited to $25,000. Participants may withdraw their
contributions at any time before stock is purchased.
The purchase price is equal to 85% of the lower of a the market price of
common stock immediately before the beginning of the applicable offering period
or b the market price of common stock at the time of the purchase. In general,
each offering period is 24 months long, but a new offering period begins every
six months. Thus, up to four overlapping offering periods may be in effect at
the same time. An offering period continues to apply to a participant for the
full 24 months, unless the market price of common stock is lower when a
subsequent offering period begins. In that event, the subsequent offering period
automatically becomes the applicable period for purposes of determining the
purchase price. The first accumulation and offering periods commenced on
February 13, 1998, the effective date of the IPO. The first accumulation period
ended on July 31, 1998, and the first offering period will end on January 31,
2000. A total of 126,259 and 61,596 shares of the Company common stock were
issued under the ESPP in fiscal 1999 and 1998, respectively, at prices ranging
from $1020 per share to $ 2598 per share.                    37 Note 6. Income Taxes

state purposes of approximately $90 million and $60 million, respectively,
available to offset taxable income in future years. The federal net operating
losses will expire, if not utilized, in 2019. The state net operating losses
will expire, if not utilized, in 2004. Federal and state tax laws impose
substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards
in the event of an ownership change, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company has not yet determined whether an ownership change
occurred due to significant stock transactions in each of the reporting years
disclosed. If an ownership change has occurred, utilization of the net operating
loss carry-forwards could be significantly reduced. Additionally, loss
carry-forwards of either Micromuse Inc. or Micromuse USA Inc. cannot be utilized
against future profits generated by the other company.

way that management organizes the operating segments within the Company for

Note 10. Management
In February 1999, the Company announced that Gregory Q. Brown would join the
Company as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and on February 17,
1999, he joined the Company as a full-time employee. The Company incurred
approximately $07 million of executive recruiting costs related to the hiring
of Mr. Brown. Included in this amount was a charge related to the fair value of
the warrant issued to the executive search firm to purchase 26,667 shares of our
common stock at a price of $2963 per share, cash fees paid to the executive
search firm and certain relocation costs. The charge for the warrant was
determined in a manner consistent with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation by using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following
assumptions: expected dividend yield of 00%, risk-free interest rate of 55 expected volatility of 50%, and expected life of seven years.
Note 11. Subsequent Event
On November 2, 1999, the Company entered into, and subsequently closed, an
agreement to acquire Calvin Alexander Networking, Inc. CAN, a privately-held
company that develops leading-edge network auto-discovery technology. Under the
terms of the acquisition agreement, Micromuse will issue approximately $42
million worth of its common stock to acquire CAN, based on the closing price on
November 2, 1999. The transaction is to be accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting and is to be treated as a tax-free reorganization for
federal income tax purposes. Certain agreements have been made to promote the
retention and motivation of CAN employees. A portion of the consideration for
the transaction is subject to a one-year lock-up agreement and a one-year price
guarantee.                    40 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
