The utility subsidiaries, SCW and CCWC, have incurred various costs and
received various credits reflected as regulatory assets and liabilities.
Accounting for such costs and credits as regulatory assets and liabilities is in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation SFAS 71. This statement sets
forth the application of generally accepted accounting principles for those
companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an
independent third-party regulator. Under SFAS 71, utility companies defer costs
and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is
probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making
process in a period different from the period in which they would have been
reflected in income by an unregulated company. These deferred regulatory assets
and liabilities are then reflected in the income statement in the period in
which the same amounts are reflected in the rates charged for service.
Property and Depreciation: SCW and CCWC capitalize, as utility plant,
the cost of additions and replacements of retirement units. Such cost includes
labor, material and certain indirect charges. Depreciation is computed on the
straight-line, remaining-life basis. For the years 2000, 1999, and 1998 the
aggregate provisions for depreciation for SCW approximated 26%, 25% and 25%
of the beginning of the year depreciable plant, respectively. The aggregate
provision for depreciation for CCWC is 25% for each of the same three years.
At December 31, 2000, Registrant has $13,179,000 in goodwill included in
Other Property and Investments. This amount represents the difference between
the purchase price of the common equity of CCWC and CCWC book equity at the
time of closing and is being amortized over a period of 40 years.
Interest: Interest is generally not capitalized for financial reporting
purposes, as such procedure is not followed for ratemaking purposes.
Revenues: Revenues include amounts billed to customers and unbilled
revenues representing amounts to be billed for usage from the last meter reading
date to the end of the accounting period.
Basic Earnings Per Common Share: Basic Earnings per Common Share are
based upon the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding and net
income after deducting preferred dividend requirements.
Fully Diluted Earnings Per Common Share: Diluted Earnings Per Common
Share are based upon the weighted average number of Common Shares including both
outstanding and potential shares issuable in connection with stock options
granted under Registrant 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, and net income after
deducting preferred dividend requirements.
Supply Cost Balancing Accounts: As permitted by the CPUC, Registrant
maintains water and electric supply cost balancing accounts for SCW to account
for under-collections and over-collections of revenues designed to recover such
costs. Recoverability of such costs is recorded in income and charged to
balancing accounts when such costs are                    37  40
incurred. The balancing accounts are reversed when such costs are recovered
through rate adjustments. Registrant accrues interest on its supply cost
balancing accounts at the rate prevailing for 90-day commercial paper.
Registrant does not maintain a Supply Cost Balancing Account for CCWC.
Debt Issue Expense and Redemption Premiums: Original debt issue expenses
are amortized over the lives of the respective issues. Premiums paid on the
early redemption of debt, which is reacquired through refunding, are deferred
and amortized over the life of the debt issued to finance the refunding. The
redemption premium on debt reacquired without refunding is amortized over the
remaining period the debt would have been outstanding.
Other Credits: Advances for construction represent amounts advanced by
developers, which are generally refundable at rates ranging from 10% to 22% of
the revenue received from the installations for which funds were advanced or in
equal annual installments over periods of time ranging from 10 to 40-year
periods. Contributions-in-aid of construction are similar to advances, but
require no refunding and are amortized over the useful lives of the related
property.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows,
cash and cash equivalents include short-term cash investments with an original
maturity of three months or less.
Financial Instrument Risk: Registrant does not carry any financial
instruments with off-balance sheet risk nor does its operations result in
concentrations of credit risk.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The table below estimates the fair
value of each represented class of financial instrument held by Registrant. For
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and short-term debt, the carrying
amount is used. Otherwise, rates available to Registrant at December 31, 2000
and 1999 for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities were used to
estimate fair value for long-term debt. Changes in the assumptions will produce
differing results.                         2000                    1999

NOTE 2 - CAPITAL STOCK
All of the series of Preferred Shares outstanding at December 31, 2000
are redeemable at the option of AWR. At December 31, 2000, the redemption price
per share for each series of $25 Preferred Shares was $2700, $2650 and $2525
for the 4%, 4 1/4% and 5% Series, respectively. To each of the redemption prices
must be added accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.
The $25 Preferred Shares, 5% Series, are subject to mandatory redemption
provisions of 1,600 shares per year. The annual aggregate mandatory redemption
requirement for this Series for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2000
is $40,000 each year.
AWR has a Registration Statement on file with the SEC for issuance,
from time to time, of up to $60 million in Common Shares, Preferred Shares
and/or debt securities. On August 16, 2000, AWR issued 1,107,000 shares under
this Registration Statement. Net proceeds from this sale were used to fund a
portion of the purchase price of CCWC and will be invested in SCW. As of
December 31, 2000, approximately $31,080,000 remained for issuance under this
registration statement.
For the year ended December 31, 2000, Registrant also issued 6,961 and
7,997 Common Shares under Registrant Common Share Purchase and Dividend
Reinvestment Plan DRP and the 401k Plan. There are 493,039 and 63,411 Common
Shares authorized but unissued under the DRP and the 401k Plan, respectively,
at December 31, 2000. For the years ended December 31, 1999 and December 31,
1998, all shares issued under Registrant Common Share Purchase and Dividend
Reinvestment Plan DRP and the 401k Plan were purchased on the open market.
Shares                    38  41
reserved for the 401k Plan are in relation to company matching contributions
and for investment purposes by participants.
There are 250,000 Common Shares reserved for issuance under Registrant
2000 Stock Incentive Plan. Under the Plan, stock options representing a total of
45,657 Common Shares upon exercise were granted to certain eligible employees on
May 1, 2000.
As of December 31, 2000 there were no retained earnings restricted,
under any of SCW debt instruments, as to the payment of cash dividends on
Common Shares. CCWC is subject to contractual restrictions on its ability to pay
dividends. There were no dividends distributed from CCWC to AWR in 2000.
In 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan
Rights Plan and authorized a dividend distribution of one right a Right to
purchase 1/1000th of Junior Participating Preferred Share for each outstanding
Common Share. The Rights Plan became effective in September 1998 and will expire
in September 2008. The Rights Plan is designed to provide shareholders'
protection and to maximize shareholder value by encouraging a prospective
acquirer to negotiate with the board.
Each Right represents a right to purchase 1/1000th of Junior
Participating Preferred Share at the price of $120, subject to adjustment the
Purchase Price. Each Junior Participating Preferred Share is entitled to
receive a dividend equal to 1000 times any dividend paid on each Common Share
and 100 votes per share in any shareholder election. The Rights become
exercisable upon occurrence of a Distribution Date. A Distribution Date event
occurs if i any person accumulates 15% of the then outstanding Common Shares,
ii any person presents a tender offer which caused the person ownership
level to exceed 15% and the board determines the tender offer not to be fair to
AWR shareholders, or iii the board determines that a shareholder maintaining
a 15% interest in the Common shares could have an adverse impact on AWR or could
attempt to pressure AWR to repurchase the holder shares at a premium.
Until the occurrence of a Distribution Date, each Right trades with the
Common Share and is not separately transferable. When a Distribution Date
occurs, AWR would distribute separately Rights Certificates to Common
Shareholders and the Rights would subsequently trade separate from the Common
Shares and each holder of a Right, other than the acquiring person whose Rights
will thereafter be void, will have the right to receive upon exercise at its
then current Purchase Price that number of Common Shares having a market value
of two times the Purchase Price of the Right. If AWR merges into the acquiring
person or enters into any transaction that unfairly favors the acquiring person
or disfavors AWR other shareholders, the Right becomes a right to purchase
Common Shares of the acquiring person having market value of two times the
Purchase Price.
The board of directors may determine that, in certain circumstances, a
proposal, which would cause a Distribution Date, is in the best interest of
AWR shareholders. Therefore, the board of directors may, at its option, redeem
the Rights at a redemption price of $001 per Right.
NOTE 3 - COMPENSATING BALANCES AND BANK DEBT
AWR maintains a revolving credit facility with a $25 million aggregate
borrowing capacity. At December 31, 2000, no amount was outstanding under this
facility. The aggregate short-term borrowing capacity available to SCW under its
three bank lines of credit was $60 million as of December 31, 2000, of which a
total of $45 million was outstanding. There were no compensating balances
required. Loans can be obtained at the option of Registrant and bear interest at
rates based on floating prime borrowing rates or at money market rates.
SCW short-term borrowing activities for the last three years were as

NOTE 4 - LONG TERM DEBT
In March 1998, SCW sold the remaining $15 million under its Series B
Medium Term Note Program and in December 1998, SCW redeemed all of its
outstanding 1010% Notes. In January 1999, $40 million of Series C Medium Term
Notes were sold. In January 2001, the remaining $20 million of Series C Medium
Term Notes were sold. The funds resulting from the issuances were used initially
to repay short-term bank borrowings and, after that, to fund construction
expenditures. SCW has no mortgage debt, and leases and other similar financial
arrangements are not material.
CCWC has long-term Industrial Development Authority Bonds IDA Bonds
and a repayment contract due 2006. Substantially all of the utility plant of
CCWC is pledged to secure its IDA Bonds. The Bond Agreement, among other things,
i requires CCWC to maintain certain financial ratios, ii restricts CCWC
ability to incur debt and make liens, sell, lease or dispose of assets, merge
with another corporation, and iii restricts the payment of dividends.
SCW has posted an Irrevocable Letter of Credit, which expires April 30,
2001 in the amount of $750,000 with an annual fee of 06% as security for its
self-insured workers' compensation plan. SCW has also provided an Irrevocable
Letter of Credit with a fee of 09%, which expires July 31, 2002, in the amount
of $6,296,000 to a trustee with respect to the variable rate obligation issued
by the Three Valleys Municipal Water District. Additionally, in November 2000,
SCW posted an Irrevocable Letter of Credit with an annual fee of 20%, which
expires in October 1, 2001, in the amount of $250,000 as security for the
deductible in the company new Business Auto insurance policy.
Annual maturities of all long-term debt, including capitalized leases,
amount to $698,799, $749,787, $13,290,644, $839,486 and $893,362 for the five
years ending December 31, 2001 through 2005, respectively.
NOTE 5 - TAXES ON INCOME
Registrant provides deferred income taxes for temporary differences
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes SFAS No. 109, for certain transactions which are recognized for
income tax purposes in a period different from that in which they are reported
in the financial statements. The most significant items are the tax effects of
accelerated depreciation, the supply cost balancing accounts and advances for
and  SFAS No. 109 also requires that
rate-regulated enterprises record deferred income taxes for temporary
differences accorded flow-through treatment at the direction of a regulatory
commission. The resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at
the expected cash flow to be reflected in future rates. Since the CPUC has
consistently permitted the recovery of previously flowed-through tax effects,
SCW has established regulatory liabilities and assets offsetting such deferred
tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred investment tax credits are being amortized to other income
ratably over the lives of the property, giving rise to the credits.
The significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities, as reflected in the balance sheets, and the accumulated net
deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2000 and 1999 were                          December 31,

NOTE 6 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Registrant maintains a pension plan the Plan that provides eligible
employees those age 21 and older, with one year of service monthly benefits
upon retirement based on average salaries and length of service. The normal
retirement benefit is equal to 2% of the five highest consecutive years average
earnings multiplied by the number of years of credited service, up to a maximum
of 40 years, reduced by a percentage of primary social security benefits. There
is also an early retirement option. Annual contributions are made to the Plan,
which comply with the funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act ERISA.
Registrant also provides all active employees medical, dental and vision
care benefits through a medical insurance plan. Eligible employees who retired
prior to age 65, and/or their spouses, were able to retain the benefits under
the active plan until reaching age 65. Eligible employees upon reaching age 65,
and those employees retiring at or after age 65, and/or their spouses, receive
coverage through a Medicare supplement insurance policy paid for by Registrant
subject to an annual cap limit.
The CPUC has issued a decision, which provides for the recovery in rates
of tax-deductible contributions made to a separate trust fund. In accordance
with that decision, Registrant established two separate trusts in 1995, one for
those retirees who were subject to a collective bargaining agreement and another
for all other retirees. Registrant funding policy is to contribute annually an
amount at least equal to the revenues authorized to be collected through rates
for post-retirement benefit costs. Post-retirement benefit costs for 1993, 1994
and 1995 were estimated at a total of $16 million                    41  44
and have been recorded as a regulatory asset for recovery over a 20-year period.
The unamortized balance at December 31, 2000 was approximately $539,500.
At December 30, 1999, Registrant had 728 participants in the Plan, 61 of
these are employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, the earliest of
which expires in 2001. The following table sets forth the Plan funded status
and amounts recognized in Registrant balance sheets and the components of net
pension cost and accrued post-retirement liability at December 31, 2000 and

prescribed by law, in an investment program managed by an outside investment
manager. Company contributions to the 401k are based upon a percentage of
individual employee contributions and, for 2000, 1999 and 1998, totaled
$968,019, $920,340, and $874,113, respectively.
NOTE 7 - BUSINESS RISKS AND CONCENTRATION OF SALES
Registrant utility operations are engaged in supplying water and
electric service to the public. Registrant is required to provide service and
grant credit to customers within its defined service areas. Although Registrant
has a diversified base of residential, industrial and other customers, revenues
derived from commercial and residential water customers accounted for
approximately 91% of total water revenues in 2000 and 90% in 1999. Registrant
faces additional risks associated with weather conditions, adequacy and quality
of water supplies, regulatory decisions, pronouncements and laws, water-related
litigation, general business conditions and condemnation.
Approximately 43% of the SCW water supply is purchased from
wholesalers of imported water, with the remainder produced from company wells.
The long-term availability of imported water supplies is dependent upon, among
other things, drought conditions throughout the state, increases in population,
water quality standards and legislation that may potentially reduce water
supplies. Reservoir storage statewide is down at the end of 2000 from year ago
levels. The California Department of Water Resources has issued an early
indication in January 2001 that if the trend of lower than normal precipitation
continues, allocation of water to state water project contractors, including
Metropolitan Water District MWD, could be curtailed. The MWD, however, has
publicly assured consumers that it is well prepared to help the region through
one or more dry years. January and February 2001 brought significant
precipitation that contributed to return the reservoir levels to normal.
CCWC has a long-term water supply contract with the Central Arizona
Water Conservation District through September 2043 and is entitled to take 6,978
acre feet of water per year from the Central Arizona Project CAP. CCWC water
supply may be subject to interruption or reduction, in particular owing to
interruption or reduction of CAP water. In the event of interruption or
reduction of CAP water, CCWC can rely on its well water supplies for short-term
periods. However, in any event, the quantity of water CCWC supplies to some or
all of its customers may be interrupted or curtailed, pursuant to the provisions
of its tariffs.
The electric energy environment in California has changed as a result of
the December 1995 CPUC decision on restructuring of California electric
utility industry and state legislation passed in 1996. There has been a
substantial increase in the costs of purchased power in recent months. On
January 17, 2001, the Governor of the State of California proclaimed a state of
emergency in California due to shortages of electricity available to certain of
California utilities resulting in blackouts, the unanticipated and dramatic
increases in electricity prices and the insufficiency of electricity available
from certain of California utilities to prevent disruption of electric service
in California. The reasons for the high cost of energy are under investigation
but are reported to include, among other things, limited supply caused by a lack
of investment in new power plants to meet growth in demand, planned and
unplanned outages of power plants, lower than usual availability of
hydroelectric power from the Pacific Northwest due to lower than usual
precipitation and higher demand for electricity in the region, transmission line
constraints and increased prices for natural gas, the fuel used in many of the
power plants serving the region.
Legislation has been enacted and executive orders issued designed to
encourage and accelerate the construction of additional power plants and the
repowering and updating of existing power plants to increase the supply of
electricity in the State. A number of investigations have also been instituted
as to the causes of the California energy situation and numerous pieces of
legislation have been introduced at the California Legislature to deal with
different aspects of the situation. The long-term impact of these legislative
initiatives on SCW Bear Valley Electric division is difficult to predict. For
the short-term, however, management expects energy costs to remain high and to
continue to be volatile.                    43  46
In response to the potential for rising electricity costs, in May 2000,
SCW entered into a one-year, block forward purchase contract with Dynegy for 12
megawatts MW of electric energy for its Bear Valley electric service
division at a price of $3550 per MW. This contract expires April 30, 2001.
Dynegy also procured electric energy requirements above the 12 MW forward
purchase contract. The average minimum load at SCW Bear Valley electric
service division has been approximately 12 MW. The average winter load has been
18 MW with a winter peak of 30 MW when the snowmaking machines at the ski
resorts are operating.
In a continuing effort to control the escalation of electric energy
costs for SCW Bear Valley Electric division, SCW is considering a number of
options including i renegotiation of the block forward purchase of electric
energy, ii purchase of electric energy from on-site generation facilities
installed by a third party and iii use of portable generation to avoid peak
energy prices. Each of these options is expected to result in increased electric
energy prices for customers of SCW Bear Valley Electric division. Management
believes that these solutions in whole or in part represent significant savings
for customers relative to reliance on spot purchases in the open market.
Management further believes that costs incurred are recoverable from customers,
although due to the nature of the regulatory process, there is a risk of
disallowance of full recovery of costs or additional delays in the recovery of
costs during any period in which there has been a substantial run-up in costs.
NOTE 8 - CONTINGENCIES
On April 22, 1999, the CPUC issued an order denying SCW application
seeking approval of its recovery through rates of costs associated with its
participation in the Coastal Aqueduct Extension of the State Water Project
SWP. SCW participation in the SWP commits it to a 40-year entitlement with a
value of approximately $95 million. SCW investment in SWP is currently
included in Other Property and Investments. The remaining balance of the related
liability of approximately $7 million is recorded as other long-term debt. SCW
intends to recover its investment in SWP through contributions from developers
on a per-lot or other basis, and, failing that, sale of its 500 acre-foot
entitlement in SWP. SCW believes that its full investment and on-going costs
associated with its ownership will be fully recovered.
SCW has been named as a defendant in fourteen lawsuits that allege that
SCW delivered contaminated water to its customers. Plaintiffs in these actions
seek damages, including general, special, and punitive damages, according to
proof of trial, as well as attorney fees on certain causes of action, costs of
suit, and other unspecified relief. Eleven of the lawsuits involve customer
service areas located in Los Angeles County in the southern portion of
California; three of the lawsuits involve a customer service area located in
Sacramento County in northern California. On September 1, 1999, the Court of
Appeal in San Francisco held that the CPUC had preemptive jurisdiction over
regulated public utilities and ordered dismissal of a series of lawsuits
pertaining to water quality filed against water utilities, including SCW. Seven
out of fourteen lawsuits against SCW had been ordered for dismissal by the state
Court of Appeals. On October 11, 1999, one group of plaintiffs appealed the
decision to the California Supreme Court, which has accepted the case.
Management is unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding but, in any
event, does not anticipate a decision prior to the fourth quarter of 2001.
In light of the breadth of plaintiff claims, the lack of factual
information regarding plaintiff claims and injuries, if any, the fact that no
discovery has yet been completed, SCW is unable to determine at this time what,
if any, potential liability it may have with respect to these claims. SCW
intends to vigorously defend itself against these allegations. Management cannot
predict the outcome of these proceedings and if SCW were found liable, SCW would
pursue recovery through its insurance coverage providers.
In response to those lawsuits and similar actions, in March 1998 the
CPUC issued an Order Instituting Investigation OII directed to all Class A and
B water utilities in California, including SCW, into whether existing standards
and policies regarding drinking water quality adequately protect the public
health and whether those standards and policies are being uniformly complied
with by those water utilities. The OII notes the constitutional and statutory
jurisdiction of the CPUC and the California Department of Health Services DOHS
to establish and enforce adherence to water quality standards for water
delivered by utilities to their customers and, in the case of the CPUC, to
establish rates which permit water utilities to furnish water that meets the
established water quality standards at prices which are both affordable and that
allow the utility to earn a reasonable return on its investment.
On November 2, 2000, a final decision from the CPUC concludes that,
among other things, the Commission has the jurisdiction to regulate the service
of water utilities with respect to the health and safety of that service; that
DOHS requirements governing drinking water quality adequately protect the public
health and safety; and that regulated water utilities, including SCW, have
satisfactorily complied with past and present drinking water quality
requirements.                    44  47
Management believes that proper insurance coverage and reserves are in
place to insure against anticipated property, general liability and workers'
compensation claims.
On October 25, 1999, SCW filed a lawsuit against the California Regional
Water Quality Control Board CRWQCB alleging that the CRWQCB has willfully
allowed portions of the Sacramento County Groundwater Basin to be injected with
chemical pollution that is destroying the underground water supply in SCW
Rancho Cordova customer service area. Management cannot predict the likely
outcome of this proceeding.
In a separate case, also filed on October 25, 1999, SCW sued Aerojet
General Corp. Aerojet for causing the contamination of the Sacramento County
Groundwater Basin. On March 22, 2000, Aerojet filed a cross complaint against
SCW for negligence and constituting a public nuisance. Registrant is unable to
determine at this time what, if any, potential liability it may have with
respect to the cross complaint, but intends to vigorously defend itself against
these allegations. Management cannot predict the likely outcome of this
proceeding.
The CPUC has authorized memorandum accounts to allow for recovery of
costs incurred by SCW in prosecuting these cases from customers, less any
recovery from the defendants or others. As of December 31, 2000, approximately
$3,268,000 has been recorded in the memorandum accounts. SCW filed an Advice
Letter on December 26, 2000 for recovery of costs incurred on or before August
31, 2000 in accordance with CPUC approved procedures. The filing was to recover
approximately $1,800,000 for costs associated with lawsuits against Aerojet and
the CRWQCB, and $879,000 for OII. Management believes that these costs are
recoverable although it can give no assurance that the CPUC will ultimately
allow recovery of all or any of the costs through rates.
NOTE 9 - CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
Registrant 2001 construction budget provides for gross expenditures of
approximately $57 million, $5 million is to be obtained from developers and
others. Of this amount, approximately $13 million is subject to CPUC approval of
an advice letter filing. Absent such approval, this amount would be included in
the next general rate case filing for SCW Region II. ASUS and CCWC do not have
material capital commitments; however, ASUS actively seeks opportunities to own,
lease or operate municipal water and wastewater systems, which may involve
significant capital commitments.
NOTE 10 - ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
The table below presents Registrant provision for doubtful accounts
charged to expense and accounts written off, net of recoveries. Provisions
included in 2000 represent both SCW and CCWC. Provisions in 1999 and 1998
represent SCW only.                            December 31,

NOTE 11 - BUSINESS SEGMENTS
AWR has three principal business units: water and electric distribution
units, through its SCW subsidiary, a water service utility operation conducted
through its CCWC unit, and a non-regulated activity unit through the ASUS
subsidiary. All activities of SCW currently are geographically located within
California. All activities of CCWC are located in the state of Arizona. Both SCW
and CCWC are regulated utilities. On a stand-alone basis, AWR has no material
assets other than its investments in its subsidiaries. The tables below set
forth information relating to SCW operating segments, CCWC and non-regulated
businesses. Included in the amounts set forth, certain assets, revenues and

NOTE 13 - YEAR 2000 READINESS UPDATE
Registrant has no Y2K incidents, business disruptions, failures or legal
proceedings to report. There were no actual or anticipated effects or changes to
Registrant operating trends or revenue patterns as a result of the millennium
turnover. Not all Y2K problems were necessarily expected to surface in early
2000. Registrant does not have, and may never fully have, sufficient information
about the Y2K exposure of third parties to adequately predict the risks posed by
them to Registrant. If the third parties later discover any Y2K problems that
are not remedied, resulting problems could include loss of utility services and
disruption of water supplies. Costs incurred to address Y2K issues are recovered
through water rates. The CPUC has authorized an increase in rates of $830,000
per year, effective October 24, 2000.                    46  49
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
The consolidated financial statements contained in the annual report
were prepared by the management of American States Water Company, which is
responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The consolidated financial
statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and include, where necessary, amounts based upon management best
estimates and judgments. All other financial information in the annual report is
consistent with the consolidated financial statements and is also the
responsibility of management.
Registrant maintains systems of internal control, which are designed to
help safeguard, the assets of Registrant and provide reasonable assurance that
accounting and financial records can be relied upon to generate accurate
financial statements. These systems include the hiring and training of qualified
personnel, appropriate segregation of duties, delegation of authority and an
internal audit function, which has reporting responsibility to the Audit
Committee of the board of directors.
The Audit Committee, composed of three outside directors, exercises
oversight of management discharge of its responsibilities regarding the
systems of internal control and financial reporting. The committee periodically
meets with management, the internal auditor and the independent accountants to
review the work and findings of each. The committee also reviews the
qualifications of, and recommends to the board of directors, a firm of
independent accountants.
The independent accountants, Arthur Andersen LLP, have performed an
audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Their audit gave consideration to Registrant
system of internal accounting control as a basis for establishing the nature,
timing and scope of their work. The result of their work is expressed in their
Report of Independent Public Accountants. s/ Floyd E. Wicks             s/ McClellan Harris III

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of American States Water Company     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
statements of capitalization of American States Water Company and the balance
sheets and statements of capitalization of Southern California Water Company
California corporations, as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in common shareholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 of
American States Water Company and the related statements of income, changes in
common shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2000 of Southern California Water Company. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Registrant management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American
States Water Company and its subsidiary, Southern California Water Company, as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. s/ Arthur Andersen LLP
