Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Description of Business  Neurobiological Technologies, Inc. NTI, we, or the Company is a drug development
company focused on the clinical evaluation and regulatory approval of neuroscience drugs. The Companys strategy is to in-license and develop later-stage drug candidates that target major medical needs and which can be rapidly commercialized.
The Companys experienced management team oversees the human clinical trials necessary to establish preliminary evidence of efficacy and seeks partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to complete development and marketing of
our product candidates.  The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary NTI-Empire, Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Currently, we receive revenues on the sales of one approved product and have two product candidates in clinical development.
Memantine, an orally-dosed compound, has been approved for treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimers disease and is marketed in the United States, beginning in 2004, and in Europe, beginning in 2003, by our marketing partners Merz
Pharmaceuticals GmbH Merz and Forest Laboratories, Inc. Forest. Memantine is also being developed for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Our product candidates are XERECPT, a compound for the treatment of peritumoral brain edema, or swelling around brain
tumors, and Viprinex, a compound for the
treatment of acute ischemic stroke.  In the course of our
development activities, we have incurred significant losses since inception and, although the Company was profitable in the year ended June 30, 2001, it will likely incur additional losses over at least the next several fiscal years. The Company may
seek to raise additional funds whenever market conditions permit. However, there can be no assurance that funding will be available, or, if available, that it will be available on acceptable terms. If the Company is not able to raise adequate funds,
it may be required to delay, scale back, or terminate its clinical trials or to obtain funds through entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others.  Revenue recognition  Revenues are recorded according to the terms of formal agreements to which we are a party, when our performance requirements have been fulfilled, the fee
is determinable and when collection of the fee is probable or reasonably assured. Revenue related to license fees with non-cancelable, non-refundable terms and no future performance obligations are recognized when collection is assured. Revenues
associated with milestone payments, pursuant to the non-cancelable and non-refundable terms of agreements to which we are a party, are recognized when we have fulfilled development milestones and when collection of the fee is assured. Revenues
resulting from royalty fees earned from the sale of the product are based upon the sales reported by our licensees and determined in accordance with the specific terms of the license agreements. We record royalty revenue when it is received because
we are unable to estimate and accrue royalty revenue due to the limited sales history of the product. We have made no material adjustments to date for revenue recorded from royalty fees. During 
43 Table of Contents Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
the year ended June 30, 2005, Merz adjusted revenues previously paid to us by approximately $108,000 as a result of the overpayment of royalty fees in
previous periods for sales in certain European countries.  Research and
development expenses  Our research and development
expenses include certain expenses that are incurred over multiple reporting periods, such as fees for contractors and consultants, patient treatment costs related to clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing costs, and license fees for use
of third-party intellectual property rights. Management assesses how much of these multi-period costs should be charged to research and development expense in each reporting period by assessing the level and related costs of the services provided
during each reporting period. In determining whether clinical trial activities performed by third parties should be recognized in a specific reporting period, management considers:  estimates of the percentage of work completed through the applicable reporting period in accordance with agreements established with the third-party service providers; and
estimates of the percentage of work completed through the applicable reporting period in accordance with discussions with internal clinical and preclinical personnel and independent
service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services.  The assessment of the percentage of work completed that determines the amount of research and development expense that should be recognized in a given
period requires significant judgment, and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations. Management applies judgment and bases its estimates with the benefit of historical experience with the development of similar
drugs and with third party contracts structured with similar performance and payment terms. While our historic estimates have been materially accurate, we recognize that estimates of expense incurred during current and future periods are determined
greatly by patient enrollment levels and related activities, which may vary from historic patterns. We monitor service providers activities to the extent possible in order to assess current enrollment levels and related activities; however, if
we under- or overestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time, we could materially under- or overestimate research and development expenses in future periods.  Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets  Intangible assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and
development, are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair values of acquired intangible assets are determined by management using relevant information and assumptions, which process is assisted by an independent,
professional appraiser. Fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate, which requires significant judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates, and the
selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. Amortization of intangibles with defined lives is calculated using the straight-line method over the period that we estimate to be the economic useful life of the related asset. 
44 Table of Contents Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
We assess the impairment of intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If it is determined that the carrying value of intangible and long-lived assets might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment, we
would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method if the undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of such assets. An impairment of our intangible or tangible long-lived assets could result in the
recording of a material, non-cash expense in our consolidated statement of operations during the period in which such a charge could occur. At June 30, 2005, we had $6,840,000 and $815,000 of net intangible and tangible long-lived assets,
respectively. Through June 30, 2005, there has been no such instance in which circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be fully recoverable and, accordingly, no impairment in the carrying value of long-lived assets
has been recorded.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates upon actual experience and other
current indications that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates in the financial statements include, but are not limited to, accrued but unbilled expenses incurred in the
performance of clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, expenses incurred and to be deducted from prepayments made for services related to clinical trials, fees and expenses incurred by independent experts and consultants who assist us with
clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, and useful lives of property and equipment for depreciation calculations.  Cash Equivalents and Investments  The Companys investments include securities of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities, corporations and mortgage-backed securities.
All securities which are highly liquid and purchased with original maturities of 90 days or less are recorded as cash equivalents. The Company has classified its cash equivalent and investment securities as available for sale securities as it does
not intend to hold securities with stated maturities greater than twelve months until maturity. The Company manages its investment securities to maintain a duration of approximately two years and, in response to liquidity requirements and changes in
the market value of securities, will sell investment securities prior to their stated maturities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at estimated fair value, based on available market information, with unrealized gains and losses reported as
a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss in Stockholders Equity. Realized gains or losses, amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and earned interest are included in investment income. The cost of securities when
sold is based upon specific identification.  Property and
Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective asset, generally two to seven years. 
45 Table of Contents Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Net Loss per Share  Basic net loss per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted net loss per share includes the impact of potentially dilutive securities. As the Companys potentially dilutive securities stock options, warrants, and convertible preferred stock were anti-dilutive, they have been excluded
from the computation of weighted-average shares used in computing diluted net loss per share for all periods presented.  The computation of diluted net loss per share for the year ended June 30, 2005 excludes the impact of options to purchase 424,640 shares of common stock,
warrants to purchase 618,769 shares of common stock, and the conversion of convertible preferred stock into 521,189 shares of common stock. The computation of diluted net loss per share for the year ended June 30, 2004 excludes the impact of options
to purchase 783,271 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 294,492 shares of common stock, and the conversion of convertible preferred stock into 626,055 shares of common stock. The computation of diluted net loss per share for the year ended
June 30, 2003 excludes the impact of options to purchase 788,221 shares of common stock, warrants to purchase 1,511,824 shares of common stock, and the conversion of convertible preferred stock into 1,295,462 shares of common stock.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees
with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and
related Interpretations. Under APB 25, when the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized.  Stock-based compensation arrangements to non-employees are accounted for in
accordance with SFAS 123, EITF 96-18, and related Interpretations, using a fair value approach, and the compensation costs of such arrangements are subject to re-measurement over their vesting terms, as earned.  As permitted by SFAS 123, and as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, SFAS 148, the Company elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
employee stock option and stock purchase plans. The Company is generally not required under APB 25 and related interpretations to recognize compensation expense in connection with its employee stock option and stock purchase plans when exercise
prices are not less than fair value.  Pro forma information
regarding net loss and net loss per share is required by SFAS 148 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair 
46 Table of Contents Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
value method prescribed by the SFAS 123. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions: expected volatility calculations, based on historical data, of 0606 in 2005 and 0846 in 2004 and 2003; and, expected option lives of five years and no dividend yield for each of 2005, 2004, and
2003. Weighted average risk free interest rate assumptions were based on U.S. government bonds, with maturities equal to the expected option lives, of 350%, 307% and 408% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight-line method. The Companys pro forma information follows in thousands.

Income Loss  Comprehensive income loss is comprised of
net income loss and other comprehensive income loss. Other comprehensive income loss includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from our net income loss, specifically, the unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities. For the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the components of comprehensive income loss have been included in the Statement of Stockholders Equity.  Derivative Financial Instruments  In March 2004, the Company raised $19,400,000 in gross offering proceeds from the sale of 3,880,000 shares of common stock
at a price of $500 per share. Investors also received warrants to purchase an additional 582,000 shares of common stock at a price of $673 per share. The Company also issued warrants to its placement agent to purchase 155,200 shares of common
stock at a purchase price of $600 per share and 23,280 shares at $808 per share. The common stock and warrants issued in this private placement were initially unregistered. The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2004, to register the shares issued in the private placement as well as the shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants. In accordance with EITF 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock, the warrants were reported as a liability and valued at fair value on the date of issuance. Pursuant to the terms of the private placement agreement, the 
47 Table of Contents Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Company could have delivered warrants for which the related shares were unregistered, but would have been required to pay a monthly penalty to each
purchaser, with no contractual maximum, until the time that the registration statement was declared effective. Accordingly, because the penalty for not registering the shares related to the warrants had no contractual maximum, the Company determined
that the penalty did not represent a reasonable difference between the value of a registered and unregistered shares and that settling with unregistered shares was not an economically reasonable alternative. The warrants were revalued each period
until the effective date of the registration statement, and the change in the fair value from the date of issuance through the date that the registration statement was effective in the amount of $477,239, has been recorded as non-cash income. The
warrants were transferred to permanent equity when they were registered.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The fair value of cash equivalents and investments is based on quoted market prices. The carrying amount of cash equivalents and investments are considered to be representative of their respective fair values at June
30, 2005 and 2004.  Reclassification  Certain balances reported in prior periods reflect the reclassification of
long-term investments to short-term investments to conform with the presentation of the reported current period as we may not hold investment securities with stated maturities greater than twelve months to such stated maturity.  Recent Accounting Pronouncement  In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair
values. As a result, the cost of employee services received in exchange for a grant of an equity instrument will be measured at fair value on the grant-date of the award and recorded as expense over the period during which the employee is required
to provide service in exchange for the award. Pro forma disclosure of such cost is no longer an alternative for disclosing the cost share-based payments to employees. According to the requirements of SFAS 123R and a rule issued by the Securities
and Exchange Commission in April 2005, SFAS 123R is effective for the Company at the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, which commences on July 1, 2005.  SFAS 123 R may be adopted using either the Modified-Prospective Transition method or the Modified-Retrospective Transition method of application Using
the Modified-Prospective Transition method, the Company would recognize the cost of share-based payments based on their grant-date fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the provisions of SFAS 123R are first adopted.
Measurement and assignment of compensation cost for share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of the date of adopting SFAS 123R would be based upon the same estimate of grant-date fair value used previously under SFAS 123, whether
the estimate was recognized in the financial statements or disclosed only in a pro forma manner. Recognizing a liability for share-based payments made prior to, but not vested as of the date of adopting SFAS 123R will be recognized as the 
48 Table of Contents Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Using the Modified-Retrospective Transition method of application, the Company would be allowed to
restate previously reported periods by recognizing compensation expense in the amounts previously reported as pro forma disclosure under the earlier provisions of SFAS 123. New awards and vested awards would be accounted for in the same manner as
the Modified-Prospective Transition method.  We have adopted
the requirements of SFAS 123R effective July 1, 2005, utilizing the Modified-Prospective Transition method and expect the adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We anticipate that the
effect of adopting SFAS 123R effective July 1, 2005, will increase total stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 by approximately $468,000.  Note 2. Acquisition of Empire Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  On July 14, 2004, NTI acquired Empire Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Empire, a privately held corporation, through the merger of Empire into Empire
Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NTI. Pursuant to the transaction, NTI acquired worldwide rights to Viprinex ancrod, a late-stage reperfusion therapy for use in treatment of ischemic stroke, a life-threatening condition caused by the blockage of blood
vessels supplying blood and oxygen to the brain. A reperfusion therapy is a drug that breaks up the blood clot causing the stroke and enables normal blood flow to return to the affected areas of the brain. Viprinex is derived from the venom of the
Malayan pit viper. The acquisition of Empire was accounted for as a purchase of assets in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Accordingly, the results of
operations of Empire have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition.  As a result of the acquisition, all of Empires issued and outstanding capital stock immediately prior to the acquisition was automatically converted
into the right to receive an aggregate of 2,399,163 shares of NTIs common stock and $1,500,020 in cash. Additionally, NTI paid $500,000 to Empires principal stockholder to partially reimburse advances previously made by the stockholder
to Empire. The aggregate purchase price paid at the date of acquisition was $12,669,184, which consists of the common stock valued at $9,452,702, cash of $2,000,020, including in-lieu payment for partial shares, and acquisition-related expenses of
$1,216,462. If pivotal Phase III trials for Viprinex are commenced as planned, NTI will issue an additional 2,375,170 shares and pay an additional $1,515,675 in cash to the selling stockholders of Empire and will pay Empires principal
stockholder the balance of $484,325 for the remainder of advances he made to Empire. The additional amounts due upon commencement of the Phase III clinical trials are being treated as contingent consideration.  As part of the purchase price allocation, all intangible assets were
identified and valued. It was determined that certain development technology, which was in-process, had value. As a result of this identification and valuation process, the Company allocated $4,251,335 of the purchase price to acquired in-process
research and development. This allocation represents the estimated fair value based upon the estimated risk-adjusted cash flows related to research and development activities associated with the preparation for Phase III clinical trials for
Viprinex. At the date of the acquisition, the development of Viprinex had not yet reached technological feasibility, and the research and 
49 Table of Contents Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
development in progress had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, the acquired in-process research and development was charged to expense as of the date
of the acquisition, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for an aggregate
purchase price of $12,669,184, including acquisition costs.  Current assets 2,251

years. Tangible assets acquired, for which no residual value is anticipated, consist of $965,027 for the snake farm, snake venom and snake venom compound concentrate from which Viprinex is derived, which will be amortized over estimated useful lives
of four to eight years. The intangible and tangible assets acquired are reported, net of accumulated amortization and depreciation as Acquisition-related tangible and intangible assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30,
2005.  Depreciation and amortization expense related to the
acquired tangible and intangible assets was $149,970 and $593,633, respectively, during the year ended June 30, 2005. The estimated depreciation and amortization expense for each of the next five years related to the acquired tangible and intangible

Note 7. Stockholders Equity  Convertible Preferred Stock 
At June 30, 2005, the Company has 504,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock outstanding. The holders of the Series A convertible preferred
stock are entitled to receive annual noncumulative dividends of 8% per share per annum, when and if declared by the Board of Directors. These dividends are in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on the common stock of the
Company. As of June 30, 2005, no dividends had been declared.  Each share of Series A preferred stock is convertible, at the holders option, subject to antidilution provisions, into one share of common stock. Additionally, each share of the preferred stock will be automatically converted into one
share of common stock upon the affirmative vote or action by written consent in lieu of vote of a majority of the then-outstanding Series A shares. The holders of preferred stock are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of
common stock into which their preferred stock is convertible.  In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Series A preferred stock have a liquidation preference, over holders of common stock, of $050 per share plus any declared but unpaid dividends.
After payment has been made to the holders of Series A preferred stock, the entire remaining assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution, if any, would be distributed ratably among the holders of common stock.  Stockholder Rights Plan  On May 19, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend
distribution of one preferred share purchase right the Right for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock to stockholders of record on May 27, 2005. The Rights were issued pursuant to, and are governed by the terms of,
that certain Rights Agreement, dated May 19, 2005, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer Trust Company, as Rights Agent the Rights Agreement and will initially trade with shares of the Companys common
stock. If a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Companys common stock the Control Stockholder in a transaction not approved in advance by the Companys Board of Directors, each Right will
entitle its holder, other than the Control Stockholder, to acquire additional shares of the Companys capital stock at a formula price set forth in the Rights Agreement. In addition, if and after a Control Stockholder acquires more than 15% of
the Companys common stock, if the Company or its business is later acquired in a merger or asset sale by the Control Stockholder or in a transaction in which all stockholders are not treated alike, stockholders with unexercised Rights, other
than the Control Stockholder, will be entitled to purchase common stock of the acquiring party or its parent entity at a formula price as set forth in the Rights Agreement.  The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights for a nominal amount at any time prior to an event that causes the Rights to become
exercisable, and the rights will expire on May 27, 2015.

1,641,706 259  In connection with the
grant of certain stock options to senior management, we recorded deferred compensation of $274,000 in fiscal 2000. Deferred compensation represents the difference in the market value of the stock on the date granted and the exercise price of these
options. Deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the option using a straight-line method. We recognized amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of $27,376
in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, and $54,750 in 2004 and 2003.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In September
2003, the Board of Directors adopted, subject to stockholder approval, the 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the 2003 ESPP. The 2003 ESPP was approved by the stockholders in December 2003. The 2003 ESPP reserves up to 500,000 shares of
common stock for sale under the ESPP. The 2003 ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined accumulation periods. The price at which the stock is purchased is equal to the lower of
85% of the fair value of the common stock on the last trading day before the commencement of the applicable offering period or 85% of the fair value of the common stock on the last trading day of the accumulation period. Under the plan, 491,404
shares remain available for issuance at June 30, 2005. The weighted average purchase price per share for shares purchased under the 2003 ESPP was $342 during the year ended June 30, 2005.  Stock Repurchase Program  In August 2002, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program
of up to 500,000 shares of the Companys common stock. Depending on market conditions and other factors, repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and in negotiated transactions, including block transactions, and may be
discontinued at any time. No shares were repurchased in the 
56 Table of Contents Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004. In the year ended June 30, 2003, the Company repurchased 32,000 shares of its common stock for $87,000. All shares
repurchased have been retired.  Common Stock Reserved for

491,404 4,350,715  Note 8. Income Taxes
The Company uses the liability method to account for
income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rules and laws that are
anticipated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce differed tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  There was no provision benefit for income taxes for the years ended June
30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 because the Company has incurred operating losses.  Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets are as follows.  June 30 2005 2004 2003 Deferred tax assets Net operating losses 12,330,000 6,830,000 6,230,000 Research credits 547,000 430,000 430,000 Other 331,000 290,000 360,000 Total deferred tax assets 13,208,000 7,550,000 7,020,000 Valuation allowance 9,852,000 7,550,000 7,020,000 Deferred tax assets 3,356,000 Deferred tax liability Purchased intangibles 3,356,000 Net deferred tax assets 
57 Table of Contents Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and
amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The net valuation allowance increased by $2,302,000, $530,000 and $1,150,000 during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
As of June 30, 2005, the Company had net operating loss
carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $29,530,000 which will expire in the years 2006 through 2025, and federal research and development tax credits of approximately $275,000 which will expire in the years 2007 through 2025.
As of June 30, 2005, the Company had net operating loss
carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $27,900,000 which will expire in the years 2006 through 2015, and state research and development tax credits of approximately $378,000 which do not expire.  Utilization of the Companys net operating loss and credit carryforwards
may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of net operating loss and credits
before utilization.  Note 9. Collaboration Agreement  In April 1998, we entered into a strategic research and marketing
cooperation agreement with Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH and Childrens Medical Center Corporation to further the clinical development and commercialization of Memantine. Pursuant to this agreement, NTI and Merz share scientific, clinical and
regulatory information about Memantine, particularly safety data, to facilitate regulatory review and marketing approval by the Food and Drug Administration and foreign regulatory authorities. Pursuant to this agreement, we will continue to share in
future revenues from sales of Memantine for all indications.  In June 2000, Merz entered into an agreement with Forest Laboratories, Inc. for the development and marketing of Memantine in the United States for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, neuropathic pain and AIDS-related dementia. In
August 2000, Merz entered into a strategic license and cooperation agreement with H. Lundbeck A/S of Copenhagen, Denmark for the further development and marketing of Memantine for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, neuropathic pain and
AIDS-related dementia. Lundbeck has acquired exclusive rights to Memantine in certain European markets, Canada, Australia and South Africa and semi-exclusive rights to co-market Memantine with Merz in other markets worldwide, excluding the United
States, where Forest has development rights, and Japan, where Merz has granted development rights to Daiichi Suntory Pharma Co., Ltd., respectively.  Through June 30, 2005, we have received approximately $14,100,000 from Merz under our 1998 strategic research and marketing cooperation agreement. We
received $3,099,511, $255,369, and $10,949 in royalty payments for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, for sales of Memantine. Commercial sales of Memantine in the United States commenced in January 2004 and revenue
for 2004 includes royalty form the sale of Memantine in the United States and Europe. Royalty payments of $10,949 in 2003 resulted from the sale of Memantine in Europe, which 
58 Table of Contents Neurobiological Technologies, Inc.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
commenced sales in that year. In October 2003, the FDA approved the commercial sale of Memantine in the United States for the treatment of mid- to
severe-Alzheimers disease, which triggered a payment of $2,531,210 to the Company under the agreement. We received no license payments in 2005 and received license payments of $2,531,210 and $1,968,690 in 2004, and 2003, respectively.
The Company may receive additional license and royalty fees
from Merz and its marketing partners, Forest and Lundbeck, from regulatory approvals in additional countries or for new indications and from sales of Memantine because the clinical development and commercial marketing of Memantine is managed by Merz
and its marketing partners, the company is unable to estimate the timing or amount of potential revenues.  Note 10. 401k Plan  NTI maintains a defined-contribution savings plan under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan covers substantially all full-time employees. Participating employees may defer a portion of their pretax earnings, up to the
limit established by the Internal Revenue Service. NTI made employer contributions to the plan, recorded as expense, of $3,546, $3,673 and $3,215 in the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Note 11. Subsequent Events  In July 2005, the Company received a royalty payment in the amount of
$1,052,448 from Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH for sale of Memantine in the quarter ended March 31, 2005.  In August 2005, the Company established a $10 million line of credit with a large, national commercial bank. The line of credit is a revolving credit
facility which is secured by the Companys assets excluding intellectual property but including the right to receive payments pursuant to intellectual property agreements, matures in two years, bears interest at the banks annual prime
rate plus 100%, provides that the Company maintain one of several alternative liquidity covenants and requires payment of an annual commitment fee of 015% on the committed balance. As of September 27, 2005, no advances had been made on the line of
credit.  In September 2005, the Company signed a definitive
agreement for the sale of its rights in XERECEPT to two wholly owned subsidiaries of a private equity firm focused on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will receive $20 million upon
closing and an additional $13 million in non-contingent installment payments in January and June 2006, and January 2007. The Company is also eligible to receive up to an additional $15 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory objectives.
The Company is eligible to receive profit-sharing payments on sales of XERECEPT in the United States and royalties on any sales elsewhere in the world, if the product receives regulatory approval. The buyers will assume responsibility for product
development and pay all product development expenses. The Company will provide services relating to the current clinical trials of XERECEPT.

Based on their evaluation as of June 30, 2005, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended were effective to ensure the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms.  Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was effective
based on these criteria.  Managements assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended June 30, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls  Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our procedures or
our internal controls will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of our controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.  In our opinion, managements assessment
that Neurobiological Technologies, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Neurobiological Technologies,
Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
