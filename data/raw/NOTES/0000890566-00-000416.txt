NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cornell Corrections, Inc. collectively with its subsidiaries, the
Company, a Delaware corporation, provides to governmental agencies the
integrated development, design, construction and management of facilities within
three operating divisions: i secure institutional correctional and detention
services, ii juvenile treatment, educational and detention services and iii
pre-release correctional and treatment services.
WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
At December 31, 1999, the Company reported a working capital deficit of
$126 million. Excluding the $400 million of borrowings outstanding under the
Company Bridge Facility, which matures in October 2000, the Company had
working capital of $274 million. Management believes that the repayment of
borrowings outstanding under the Bridge Facility will be funded from potential
proceeds of one, or a combination, of the efforts the Company is currently
pursuing or negotiating to raise long term financing including: a the issuance
of longer term subordinated debt, b an expansion of the existing revolving
line of credit under the 1998 Credit Facility, c a sale and leaseback of
certain owned facilities and leasehold interests, or d other debt or equity
financing arrangements. Should the Company not be successful in raising longer
term financing pursuant to its efforts as described above before maturity of the
Bridge Facility, the lender has an option to convert the borrowings outstanding
under the Bridge Facility into eight year exchange notes, and to purchase up to
five percent of the Company outstanding common stock at an exercise price of
110% of the market price of the Company common stock as of the date of the
exchange. If these contemplated financing transactions are not consummated, the
Company would be required to seek alternative and potentially dilutive capital
funding sources to repay the Bridge Facility when due. No assurance can be made
that the Company will be able to obtain the various financings described above.
The Company lease financing arrangement see Note 7 does not provide
sufficient financing to fund the remaining construction costs for the New Morgan
Academy, which is currently under construction, and the Moshannon Valley
Correctional Center for which construction commenced in 1999 but as of February
2000 was still under a Stop-Work Order issued by the Federal Bureau of Prisons
in June 1999. As of February 2000, there were approximately $615 million in
anticipated unfunded capital requirements for the completion of these two
projects. The funds for these new facilities are expected to be expended during
the next twelve to eighteen months. The Company lease financing arrangement is
available to fund up to approximately $72 million of these construction costs.
Management believes that the remaining facility construction costs will be
funded with an increase of the Company lease financing arrangement.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial
statements contained herein to conform to the current year presentation.
CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
- 35    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Cornell increased its allowance for doubtful accounts during the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 by $255,000, $509,000 and $1,025,000,
respectively. Write-offs totaling $432,000, $12,000 and $1,164,000 were charged
against the allowance during the periods ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999,
respectively. Cornell acquired approximately $2,821,000 of allowance through its
acquisition of Abraxas in 1997.
RESTRICTED ASSETS
For certain facilities, the Company maintains bank accounts for restricted
cash belonging to offenders or residents, commissary operations, an equipment
replacement fund used in state programs and a restoration fund for certain
facilities. These bank accounts and commissary inventories are collectively
referred to as restricted assets and the corresponding obligations are included
in accrued expenses in the accompanying financial statements.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Ordinary maintenance and
repair costs are expensed, while renewal and betterment costs are capitalized.
Prepaid facility use cost, which resulted from the July 1996 acquisition of the
Big Spring Complex and the December 1999 transfer of ownership of the Great
Plains Correctional Facility to a leasehold interest, is being amortized over 50
years using the straight-line method. Buildings and improvements are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives of 30 to 50 years using the straight-line
method. Furniture and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful
lives of 3 to 10 years using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is computed on the straight-line method based upon the shorter of
the life of the asset or the term of the respective lease.
Effective July 1, 1999, the lease term for the three original Big Spring
Complex units was extended from an average of 35 years to 50 years. At this
date, management revised its estimated useful lives of the Big Spring Complex
and two other secure institutions to 50 years which management believes more
closely reflects the useful life of the specific facilities. The effect of this
change reduced building depreciation and prepaid facility use amortization by
approximately $300,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999.
CAPITALIZED INTEREST
The Company capitalizes interest on facilities under development and
construction. Interest capitalized during 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $1,171,000 2,293,000 and $151,000, respectively.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the
fair market value of their net tangible and identified intangible assets.
Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years, which
represents management estimation of the related benefit to be derived from the
acquired businesses. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed periodically if
events and circumstances suggest that it may be permanently impaired. If the
review indicates that goodwill will not be recoverable, as determined by the
undiscounted cash flow method, the asset will be reduced to its estimated
recoverable value. Accumulated amortization of goodwill was $3,004,000 and
$1,694,000 as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
- 36    Non-compete agreements have been obtained principally through the
acquisition of businesses and are amortized over periods of 9 to 10 years on a
straight-line basis. Accumulated amortization of non-compete agreements was
$324,000 and $80,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Intangible assets at December 31, 1999 and 1998, were as follows in
thousands                              1999     1998

Accumulated amortization.   3,328   1,774
$ 18,270  $  9,935
DEFERRED COSTS
In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities, which requires
entities to expense start-up costs as incurred and to expense previously
capitalized start-up costs as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in the year adopted. In January 1999, the Company adopted SOP 98-5 and
recorded a net of tax charge of $2,954,000 for the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle.
Costs incurred related to obtaining credit financing are capitalized and
amortized over the term of the related indebtedness. At December 31, 1999, the
Company had recorded net deferred debt issuance costs of approximately
$2,634,000 related to obtaining the 1998 Credit Facility, the Senior Secured
Notes and the Bridge Facility. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
REALIZATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,
requires that long-lived assets be probable of future recovery in their
respective carrying amounts as of each balance sheet date. Management believes
its long-lived assets are realizable and that no impairment allowance is
necessary pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 121 as of December 31, 1999.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Substantially all revenues are derived from contracts with federal, state
and local government agencies, which pay either per diem rates based upon the
number of occupant days or hours served for the period or cost-plus
reimbursement. Revenues are recognized as services are provided. Deferred
revenues result from advances or prepayments from agencies for future services
to be provided.
INCOME TAXES
The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as
required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the liability
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases based on enacted tax rates.
- 37    USE OF ESTIMATES
The Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. Financial statements prepared
in accordance with GAAP require the use of management estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Additionally, management estimates affect the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The significant estimates made by management in the accompanying
financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts.
BUSINESS CONCENTRATION
Contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies account for
nearly all of the Company revenues. The loss of or a significant decrease in
business from one or more of these governmental agencies could have a material
adverse effect on the Company financial condition and results of operations.
For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, 198%, 201% and
314%, respectively, of the Company consolidated revenues were derived from
contracts with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company considers the fair value of all financial instruments not to be
materially different from their carrying values at the end of each fiscal year
based on management estimate of the Company ability to borrow funds under
terms and conditions similar to those of the Company existing debt.
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In accordance with
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, certain pro forma
disclosures are provided in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution from the exercise or conversion of
securities, such as stock options, into common stock.
2.  ACQUISITIONS
1999 ACQUISITION
In November 1999, the Company acquired certain of the adult and juvenile
behavioral health and correctional assets of Interventions, a not-for-profit
corporation headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, and BHS Consulting Corporation
BHS, a for-profit firm that provides management services to Interventions.
The assets acquired included more than 30 programs provided throughout Illinois
and the real properties of seven facilities. The aggregate purchase price for
the transactions was approximately $318 million including transaction costs.
The Company financed the transactions with borrowings under the Company $50
million Bridge Facility. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
- 38    The acquisition costs and the estimated fair market value of the aggregate
assets acquired and liabilities assumed associated with the Interventions and
BHS acquisitions were as follows in thousands        Cash  $ 30,889

Alaskan assets of Allvest, Inc. Allvest, a privately held company based in
Anchorage, Alaska. The Allvest acquisition included the operations of five
pre-release facilities with an aggregate capacity of 540 beds in Anchorage,
Fairbanks and Bethel, Alaska, and the real properties of three of the five
facilities. Total consideration for these acquisitions was approximately $651
million.
The acquisition costs and the estimated fair market value of the assets

In December 1999, the Company transferred ownership of its Great Plains
Correctional Facility to the Hinton Economic Development Authority and retained
a 75 year leasehold interest in the property plus a renewal option. Building
cost was reduced and prepaid facility use cost was increased by approximately
$430 million at the date of the transfer.
In November 1999, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale and
leaseback of certain of its furniture and equipment including information
systems hardware and software. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Construction in progress at December 31, 1999, consists primarily of
construction costs attributable to expansions of the Big Spring Complex and the
Cornell Abraxas I facility.
The Company utilizes an unrelated privately owned construction company
Construction Contractor as its preferred contractor for construction
projects. The Construction Contractor has received contracts to construct
facilities which the Company owns and/or operates totaling approximately $685
million, $204 million, and $710 million during the years ended December 31,
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Management believes the Company is a
substantial customer of the Construction Contractor. During the year ended
December 31, 1999, this Construction Contractor paid the Company $10 million
related to a cost-sharing agreement in connection with the operations of the
Santa Fe County Adult Detention Facility because the operating margins had not
reached certain levels until June 1999. These cost-sharing payments were
reported by the Company as a reduction of operating expenses. The Construction
Contractor has no obligation to make any further cost-sharing payments.

As of December 31, 1999, $400 million of borrowings were outstanding under
the Company $500 million Bridge Facility which is unsecured and matures in
October 2000. At December 31, 1999, interest on the Bridge Facility was LIBOR
plus a margin of 60%. The margin increases by 05% each quarter until repaid.
At maturity, the lenders have an option to convert the borrowings outstanding
under the Bridge Facility into longer term exchange notes and to purchase up to
5% of the Company outstanding common stock at an exercise price of 110% of the
market price of the Company common stock on the date of the exchange.

In December 1998, the Company formalized terms under an amended and
restated credit agreement with a financial institution the 1998 Credit
Facility. The 1998 Credit Facility provides for borrowings up to $600 million
under a revolving line of credit, the availability of which is determined by the
Company projected pro forma cash flow. The $600 million borrowing capacity is
reduced by $30 million per quarter beginning September 30, 2000. The 1998
Credit Facility matures in March 2003 and bears interest, at the election of the
Company, at either the prime rate plus a margin of 0% to 05% or a rate which is
175% to 250% above the applicable LIBOR rate. Interest is payable monthly with
respect to prime rate loans and at the expiration of the applicable LIBOR period
for LIBOR based loans. Commitment fees equal to 0375% per annum are payable on
the unused portion of the facility. The 1998 Credit Facility is secured by
substantially all of the Company assets, including the stock of all the
Company subsidiaries, does not permit the payment of cash dividends and
requires the Company to comply with certain earnings, net worth and debt service
covenants. Additionally, the 1998 Credit Facility provides the Company with the
ability to enter into future operating lease agreements that provide for
residual value guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In July 1998, the Company completed a private placement of $500 million of
Senior Secured Notes Senior Notes, of which $250 million was issued in July
1998 and $250 million in August 1998. The Senior Notes, which bear interest at
a fixed rate of 774%, mature on July 15, 2010. Under the Senior Notes purchase
agreements, the Company is required to make eight annual principal payments of
$625 million beginning on July 15, 2003 and comply with certain financial
covenants. Earlier payments of principal are allowed subject to certain
prepayment provisions. Interest is payable semi-annually. The holders of the
Senior Notes and the lenders under the 1998 Credit Facility have a
collateral-sharing agreement whereby both sets of creditors have an equal
security interest in substantially all the assets of the Company.
Notes payable pertain to financed insurance premiums and various vehicle
notes. Scheduled maturities of long-term debt were as follows in thousands            For the year ending December 31                $                     9,500

OPERATING LEASES
The Company leases office space and certain facilities under long-term
operating leases. Rent expense for all operating leases for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, was approximately $5,358,000, $4,490,000 and
$3,583,000, respectively. Under the 1998 Credit Facility, the Company has
entered into operating lease agreements for the acquisition or development of
operating facilities. The leases under this arrangement each have a term of five
years, include purchase and renewal options and provide for a substantial
residual value guarantee approximately 85% of the total cost by the Company
which could, under certain circumstances, be due upon termination of the leases.
Upon termination of a lease, the Company could either exercise a purchase
option, or the facilities could be sold to a third party. The Company expects
the fair market value of the leased facilities to substantially reduce or
eliminate the Company potential obligation under the residual value guarantee.
At December 31, 1999, there was one operating lease under this arrangement;
however, the table of future minimum lease payments below includes the
anticipated lease payments related to projects currently in process for which
the Company will enter into lease arrangements at construction completion.
In November 1999, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale and
leaseback of certain of its furniture and equipment. The Company has purchase
and lease renewal options at projected future fair market values under the
agreements. The leases are classified as operating leases. At the date of sale,
furniture and equipment with carrying values totaling $11,834,000 were sold and
the gains realized on the sale totaling $7,261,000 were deferred and are being
credited to income as rent expense adjustments over the lease term.
As of December 31, 1999, the Company had the following rental commitments
under noncancelable operating leases and anticipated lease payments under the
Company facility lease financing arrangement in thousands            For the year ending December 31                $  8,777

401K PLAN
The Company has a defined contribution 401k plan. The Company matching
contribution currently represents 50 percent of a participant contribution, up
to the first six percent of the participant salary. For the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, the Company recorded $754,000, $611,000 and
$514,000, respectively, of contribution expense.
OTHER
The Company is subject to certain claims and disputes arising in the normal
course of the Company business. In the opinion of the Company management,
uninsured losses, if any, resulting from the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not have a material adverse impact on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
- 43 8.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
On May 1, 1998, the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan. Under the
plan, each stockholder of record at the close of the business day on May 11,
1998, received one Preferred Stock Purchase Right Right for each share of
common stock held. The Rights expire on May 1, 2008. Each Right initially
entitles the stockholder to purchase one one-thousandth of a Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Share for $12000. Each Preferred Share has terms
designed to make it economically equivalent to one thousand common shares. The
Rights will become exercisable only in the event a person or group acquires 15%
or more of the Company common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer
which, if consummated, would result in that person or group owning 15% or more
of the Company common stock. If a person or group acquires a 15% or more
position in the Company, each Right except those held by the acquiring party
will then entitle its holder to purchase, at the exercise price, common stock of
the Company having a value of twice the exercise price. The effect will be to
entitle the holder to buy the common stock at 50% of the market price. Also, if
following an acquisition of 15% or more of the Company common stock, the
Company is acquired by that person or group in a merger or other business
combination transaction, each Right would then entitle its holder to purchase
common stock of the acquiring company having a value of twice the exercise
price. The effect will be to entitle the Company stockholders to buy stock in
the acquiring company at 50% of the market price. The Company may redeem the
Rights at $001 per Right at any time prior to the acquisition of 15% or more of
its common stock by a person or group.
STOCK OFFERING
On October 17, 1997, the Company completed an offering of its common stock.
Net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the 2,250,000 shares of newly
issued common stock were approximately $411 million. Proceeds from the offering
were used to repay indebtedness of $180 million under a credit facility, with
the remainder used for 1998 acquisitions.
PREFERRED STOCK
Preferred stock may be issued from time to time by the Board of Directors
of the Company, which is responsible for determining the voting, dividend,
redemption, conversion and liquidation features of any preferred stock.
OPTIONS
In May 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan and amended and
restated the plan in April 1998 1996 Plan. Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the
Company may grant non-qualified and incentive stock options. The Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for determining the exercise
price and vesting terms for the options. Additionally, prior to the Company
initial public offering IPO, the Company made various grants of options to
purchase the Company common stock.
Under the 1996 Plan, the Company may grant options for up to the greater of
1,500,000 shares or 15% of the aggregate number of shares of common stock
outstanding. The 1996 Plan option exercise price can be no less than the market
price of the Company common stock on the date of grant. The 1996 Plan options
vest up to seven years and expire seven to ten years from the grant date.

- 45    Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of each option grant was estimated on
the date of grant using the minimum value calculation prior to the IPO and the
Black-Scholes option pricing model subsequent to the IPO. The following weighted
average assumptions were used for grants in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively:
risk-free interest rates of 66%, 58% and 65%; dividend rates of $0, $0 and
$0; expected lives of 100, 100 and 100 years; expected volatility of 6574 5470% and 5479%.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model and other existing models were
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferrable. In addition, option valuation
models require the input of and are highly sensitive to subjective assumptions
including the expected stock price volatility. The Company employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimate.
On July 8, 1996, the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer
of the Company exercised options to purchase 137,110 and 82,750 shares of Class
A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock at an aggregate price of $274,220 and
$180,638, respectively. In connection with the exercise, each officer entered
into a promissory note with the Company for the respective aggregate exercise
amounts. The promissory notes, as amended, bear interest at the applicable
short-term federal rate as prescribed by Internal Revenue Service regulations,
mature in June 2004, are full recourse and are collateralized by shares of
common stock.
TREASURY STOCK
During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company repurchased 142,100
shares of common stock on the open market under a share repurchase program at an
aggregate cost of $1,646,000.
