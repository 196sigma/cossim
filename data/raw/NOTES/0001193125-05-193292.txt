REPORT OF DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Avanex Corporation Fremont, California  We have audited managements assessment,
included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Avanex Corporation and subsidiaries the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June
30, 2005, because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified in managements assessment based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  A material
weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weaknesses have been identified and included in managements assessment:  1.
As of June 30, 2005, the Company did not maintain effective controls over the financial closing and reporting process due to insufficient personnel with a requisite
level of accounting knowledge, experience 
47 Table of Contents 
and training in the applications of generally accepted accounting principles to the unusual and complex accounting transactions commensurate with the
Companys financial reporting process. This material weakness contributed to the following control deficiencies relating to the preparation of the Companys financial statements which are individually considered to be material weaknesses:
a.
The Company did not maintain effective control in the identification, valuation and the accounting for the components of the senior secured convertible notes issued by the Company.
This deficiency in the operation of the control resulted in adjustments recorded in the Companys financial statements in the fourth quarter.  b.
The Company did not maintain effective control around the determination of the restructuring reserves as amounts were accrued prematurely. This deficiency in the operation of the
control resulted in an adjustment to the financial statements in the fourth quarter.  2.
As of June 30, 2005, the Company did not maintain effective control over the preparation and review of the income tax provision and disclosures which resulted in unreconciled
deferred tax items, omission of rate reconciliations from disclosures, use of the incorrect state tax rate in computations, and lack of support for the recoverability of a research and development credit recorded in one of the subsidiarys
accounting records. These deficiencies in both the design and operation of the controls over reporting for income taxes resulted in certain adjustments to the Companys income tax computations and disclosures in the notes to the financial
statements.  3.
As of June 30, 2005, the Companys finance and accounting organization was not adequately staffed with personnel having a requisite level of knowledge of the Companys
business, its accounting policies and practices and the application of generally accepted accounting principles commensurate with the size of the Companys business. The Companys finance and accounting organization included many temporary
consultants hired by the Company towards the end of the year. This deficiency in the operation of the controls through adequate staffing levels could result in a misstatement that is more than inconsequential to both the interim and the annual
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.  4.
As of June 30, 2005, the Company did not design effective controls around the process of management override and review of journal entries in multiple locations. Specifically, no
independent review of journal entries was performed and journal entries submitted by subsidiaries were not reviewed. In addition, investment reports were not scrutinized such that an adjustment was required in the fourth quarter to reclassify
investments for financial statement presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These deficiencies in the design of the controls over the journal entry processes, individually or in aggregate, could result in a material
misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.  5.
As of June 30, 2005, the Company did not maintain effective controls around the authorization, review and recording of the return material authorization RMA in the Companys
subsidiary in France. This deficiency in the design of controls over the authorizations for returned materials could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statement that would not be prevented or detected.
6.
As of June 30, 2005 the Company did not maintain effective controls over disbursement of funds. In several instances, disbursements of funds occurred without the approvals required
by the Companys control processes. These deficiencies in the operation of controls over the cash disbursements processes, individually or in aggregate, could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that
would not be prevented or detected.  7.
As of June 30, 2005 the Company did not maintain effective controls over recording and purchases of inventory at one of the Companys manufacturing locations. The
Companys policies regarding the approval of purchase orders, restrictions on access to material master files, review of standard costs and inventory spares reserves were not followed. These deficiencies in both the design and operation of
inventory purchasing control processes, individually or in aggregate, could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 
48 Table of Contents 8.
As of June 30, 2005 the Company did not maintain effective controls over user access to an application used by the Company as a subsidiary ledger for stock option records. These
deficiencies in the operation of controls over the application could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim financial statement that would not be prevented or detected.  9.
As of June 30, 2005, the Company did not maintain effective internal controls at its French subsidiary over the financial closing and reporting process, revenue invoicing and
revenue cut-off, inventory purchasing and valuation. These deficiencies in the design of controls could result in a material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.  10.
As of June 30, 2005 the Company did not maintain an effective control environment. The financial reporting organizational structure was not adequate to support the size,
complexity, operating activities or locations of the Company. Deficiencies in local accounting operations such as the lack of controls over journal entries in France and insufficient staffing for finance and reporting positions in Fremont,
California contributed to an overall weakness in the environment. Further, the following specific areas are examples of some of the corporate departments in the Company where additional skilled resources are required: tax, external financial
reporting, and corporate accounting. The control deficiencies indicate that the Company did not maintain an effective control environment. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to annual or interim financial statements
that would not be prevented or detected.  These material
weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended June 30, 2005 of the Company and this
report does not effect our report on such consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.  In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, because of the affect of the material weaknesses described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended June 30, 2005 of the Company
and our report dated September 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the uncertainty of the Companys ability to continue as a
going concern.  DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP  San Jose, California September 28, 2005

REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Stockholders Avanex Corporation  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Avanex Corporation as of June30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June30, 2004. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule for the two years in the period ended
June30, 2004 listed in the Index at a. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based
on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Avanex
Corporation at June 30, 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule for the two years in the period ended June 30, 2004, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, under the heading Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in fiscal 2003 Avanex Corporation changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other purchased intangible assets.  S/ERNST YOUNG

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Avanex Corporation Fremont, California  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Avanex Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of June 30 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the year then ended. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule for the year ended June 30, 2005 listed in the Index at
a2. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the
auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, such 2005 consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30,
2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such 2005 financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Companys recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans concerning
these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment
of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP  San Jose, California September28, 2005

AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Note 1. Description of Business and
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The Company 
Avanex Corporation Avanex or the Company
designs, manufactures and markets fiber optic-based products, known as photonic solutions, which are designed to increase the performance of optical networks. Avanex sells products to telecommunications system integrators and their network carrier
customers. Avanex was founded in October 1997, and began making volume shipments of products during the quarter ended September30, 1999.  Basis of Presentation  Certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated balance sheet as of June30, 2004 to conform to current period presentation. The
consolidated statement of operations for fiscal years ended June30, 2004 and 2003 have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect previously reported results of operations or retained
earnings.  The consolidated financial statements include
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances have been eliminated.  During the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company incurred net losses of $1084 million, $1241 million and $1029 million and negative
cash flow from operations of $829 million, $1771 million and $335 million, respectively, and its balance of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted short and long-term investments declined from $1236 million at June 30, 2004 to $657 million at
June 30, 2005. These factors cast substantial uncertainty on the Companys ability to continue as an ongoing enterprise for a reasonable period of time. The Companys ability to continue as an ongoing enterprise in its current
configuration is dependent on it securing additional funding. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as an ongoing enterprise.  Management believes that it will be able to improve the Companys operating performance in fiscal 2006 as we will continue with our restructuring efforts that will result in a significant reduction in the size of
our workforce. Furthermore, the continued transfer and centralization of our manufacturing operations to lower-cost geographic regions such as Bangkok, Thailand, should reduce our overall costs and the portion of costs that are fixed.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Significant estimates
made by management include the calculation of allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory write-downs, allowance for sales returns, warranty provisions, impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, acquired in-process research and
development, restructuring expenses, litigation and contingency assessments, and deferred tax assets.  Discontinued Operations  The operating results of the Companys silica planar lightwave circuit PLC product line manufactured in Livingston, Scotland, which was sold in February 2004, are reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended June30, 2004. 
56 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Investments  The Company considers all highly liquid investment securities with maturity
from the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Restricted cash and investments are cash and investments that are collateral against debt obligations and that the Company cannot use to fund its operations.  In fiscal 2005 the Company reclassified its investment portfolio from
held-to-maturity to available-for-sale because management does not have the intent or ability to hold the securities to maturity and intends to use the funds for operations.  Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and
reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Investments that do not meet this criterion have
been classified as available-for-sale.  Held-to-maturity
securities are stated at cost. The cost of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and interest on the securities are included in interest
income.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses, if any, included as a component of stockholders equity.  Interest, dividends and realized gains and losses are included in interest and other income expense. Realized gains and losses are recognized based on
the specific identification method.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company evaluates the estimated fair value of
financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies. The use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The fair value of the
Companys cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates the carrying amount due to the relatively short maturity of these items. The fair value of the convertible notes approximates the
face value of the notes due to there having been no significant change in interest rates during the period from the notes issuance to June30, 2005. 
Concentration of Credit and Other Risks  Financial instruments, which subject the Company to potential credit risk, consist of demand deposit accounts, money market accounts, short-term
investments and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its demand deposit accounts, money market accounts and short-term investments primarily with three financial institutions. The Company invests its excess cash principally in debt securities.
The Company sells its products primarily to large
communication vendors. The Company extends reasonably short collection terms but does not require collateral from most of its customers. The Company maintains a provision for credit losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required
payments. When the Company becomes aware, subsequent to delivery, of a customers potential inability to meet its payment obligations, the Company records a specific allowance for doubtful accounts. For all other customers, the Company 
57 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due. If the financial condition of its customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. This may be magnified due to the concentration of its sales to a limited number of customers. The Company has not experienced
significant credit losses to date. Concentrations of credit risk, with respect to these financial instruments, exist to the extent of amounts presented in the financial statements.  As of June30, 2005, approximately 52% of the Companys employees worldwide were represented by labor unions or
labor organizations. Approximately 70 employees located in our New York facility are represented by the American Flint-Glass Workers Union AFL-CIO, including Local Union No1000 with a term to December 2005, and approximately 345 employees
located in Europe are represented by labor organizations.  Inventories
Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and
finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed on a currently adjusted standard basis which approximates actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis.  The Company writes off the cost of inventory that the Company specifically identifies and considers obsolete or excessive to
fulfill future sales estimates. The Company defines obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process. Excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage, and is determined using
managements best estimate of future demand at the time, based upon information then available to the Company.  In estimating excess inventory, the Company used a range of six-month to twelve-month demand forecast in fiscal 2005 and 2004. In fiscal 2003, the Company
used a three-month demand forecast. The Company also considers: 1 parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products, 2 parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be engineered out of the Companys products, and 3
known design changes which would reduce the Companys ability to use the inventory as planned.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or two to four years for computer hardware
and software, three years for production and engineering equipment and five years for office equipment, furniture and fixtures. The Company amortizes capital leases and leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
assets estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms typically two to five years.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  In accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized, but are instead tested for impairment annually or sooner, if circumstances
indicate they may no longer be recoverable. Goodwill impairment testing is a two-step process. The first step, screens for impairment, while the second step measures the impairment, if any. SFAS 142 requires impairment testing based on reporting
units. Management believes that we operate in one segment, which we consider our sole reporting unit. Therefore, goodwill will continue to be tested for impairment at the enterprise level. In addition, SFAS 142 includes provisions for the
reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill and the reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles. During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, after comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to
its fair value, it was determined that the 
58 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
goodwill recorded was impaired. After the second step of comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value, the Company recognized a
transitional impairment loss of $375 million. This loss was recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company amortized goodwill over its estimated useful life of 3 to 5 years. There was no
goodwill impairment in fiscal 2005 and 2004 pursuant to SFAS 142.  Intangible assets with definite lives consist primarily of intellectual property acquired and purchased intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets primarily include existing and core technology, trademarks and trade names, supply
agreements and customer lists. Other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable the Company recognizes such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted
cash flows attributable to such assets. Impairment losses of $15 million were incurred for year ended June30, 2003.  Restructuring Costs  The Company recorded significant accruals in connection with restructuring in accordance with SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities. Costs associated with restructuring activities initiated after December31, 2002 have been recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan as was the criteria
prior to December31, 2002. Given the significance and complexity of restructuring activities, and the timing of the execution of such activities, the restructuring accrual process involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time
the original decisions were made, including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub-lease rents. The Company continually evaluates the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under the restructuring initiatives.
Although these estimates accurately reflect the costs of the restructuring programs, actual results may differ, thereby requiring the Company to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions.  Pension Benefits  For defined benefit pension plans, liabilities and prepaid expenses are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method
with projected final salary, and recognizing, actuarial gains and losses in excess of more than 10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation or 10% of the fair value of any plan assets, over the expected average remaining working
lives of the employees participating in the plan.  Contingency Accruals
The Company evaluates contingent liabilities including
threatened or pending litigation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No5 SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceedings is considered
probable and the amount can be estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based upon managements judgment and the best information available to management
at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. 
59 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In addition to product warranties, Avanex, from time to time, in the normal course of business,
indemnifies certain customers with whom it enters into contractual relationships. Avanex has agreed to hold the other party harmless against third party claims that Avanexs products, when used for their intended purpose, infringe the
intellectual property rights of such third party or other claims made against certain parties. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior
indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim. Historically, Avanex has not made payments under these obligations and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on
the balance sheets as of June30, 2005 and 2004.  Foreign Currency
The functional currencies of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of the foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars at current period end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using
weighted average exchange rates in effect during the period. The gains and losses from the translation of these subsidiaries financial statements into the U.S. dollar are recorded directly into a separate component of stockholders equity
under the caption Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in stockholders equity. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the Companys results of operations.  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income  Statement of Accounting Standards No130 Reporting Comprehensive
Income FAS 130 requires that all items required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income, including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency
translation adjustments, be reported in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the Company has reported comprehensive income loss within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. Foreign currency
translation adjustments for the years ended June30, 2005 and 2004 resulted in gains of approximately of $770,000 and $52 million, respectively, resulting in comprehensive net losses of $1081 million and $1189 million, respectively. For the
year ended June30, 2003 net loss equaled comprehensive net loss. Accumulated other comprehensive income at June30, 2005 was $55 million and was comprised of a $60 million favorable cumulative translation adjustment, which represents
the effect of translating our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into our reporting currency since we began having foreign subsidiaries, and a $484,000 unrealized loss on investments.  Revenue Recognition  The Companys revenue recognition policy complies with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue
Recognition. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been shipped, risk of loss has been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured, fees are fixed or determinable and there are no
uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance. A provision for estimated sales returns and price adjustments is recorded in the same period as when the related revenues are recorded. These estimates are based on historical sales returns and
adjustments, other known factors and our return policy. If future sales returns differ from the historical data used to calculate these estimates, changes to the provision may be required. The Company generally does not accept product returns from
customers; however, the Company does sell its products under warranty. Specific warranty terms and conditions vary by customer and region in which the Company does business, however, the warranty period is generally one year. 
60 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Stock-Based Compensation  The Company grants stock options and stock purchase rights for a fixed number of shares to employees and directors with an
exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. As permitted under the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123 as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure SFAS 148, for the years ending
June30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company accounted for stock option grants and stock purchase rights to employees and directors in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB Opinion No25 and, accordingly, recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants or stock purchase rights with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the shares at the date of
grant. Accordingly, deferred stock compensation was recognized for an option or share purchase right that had an exercise price that was less than the fair value of the common shares and was calculated as the difference between the option price or
share purchase right exercise price at the date of grant and the fair value of the Companys common shares at that date. Such deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting period, generally a maximum of four years, using the
multiple option approach pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No28 Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans FIN 28.  Equity instruments granted to consultants are accounted for under the fair
value method pursuant to SFAS 123 and EITF 96-18, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and are subject to periodic revaluations over their vesting terms. The expense is recognized as the instruments vest.  Pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per common share under
the fair value method for options and share repurchase rights granted prior to the Companys initial public offering was estimated at the date of grant using the minimum value method. The fair value of stock options, share purchase rights and
shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan collectively the options granted subsequent to the initial public offering were valued using Black-Scholes valuation model based on the actual stock closing price on the day previous
to the date of grant. The option valuation models were developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions. Because the Companys stock-based awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock-based awards. The fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant using the following weighted-average
assumptions:  Employee Stock Option Plan Employee Stock Purchase Plan Years Ended June30 Years Ended June30 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Risk-free interest rate

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to
expense over the options vesting period. The Companys pro forma information is as follows in thousands, except per share data:  Years Ended June30 2005 2004 2003 Net loss As reported 108,371 124,067 102,912 Stock-based employee compensation expense recovery included in reported net loss 366 875 351 Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based methods for all awards 26,136 17,014 2,626 Pro forma net loss 134,141 140,206 105,889 Basic and diluted net loss per common share As reported 075 095 151 Pro forma 093 107 155
In fiscal 2006 the
Company will adopt FASB Statement No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, which is a revision of FASB Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under SFAS 123R, all shared-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to be expensed in the financial statements based on their fair value determined by applying a fair value measurement method. The adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on the
Companys financial position and results of operations.  Research and
Development Costs  Research and development costs are
expensed as incurred.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue consists of costs of components and raw materials, direct
labor, warranty, manufacturing overhead, payments to contract manufacturers, shipping costs and inventory write-offs for obsolete and excess inventory.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specifically identified customers and as a percentage of the accounts receivable balance based on aging and risk categories. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. In addition, under the Companys accounting policy, it continually assesses the balance of its allowance for doubtful accounts based on, among
other things, its customers payment history and financial condition, including a review of the customers balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of cash flows and credit reports. If actual write-offs were greater than the
Companys estimates, it would increase its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would increase its bad debt expense. 
62 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Income Taxes  The Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation
allowance is provided to reduce net deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  Earnings per Share  Basic net loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed in
the same manner and also gives effect to all dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of stock options issued to employees under employee stock option plans and warrants see Note 12.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No151, Inventory
Costs, an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4, SFAS 151, which amends the guidance in ARB No43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs and spoilage. This statement now requires that these costs be expensed as current period charges. In addition, this statement requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
of the production facilities. The provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. We do not believe that our adoption of SFAS 151 on July1, 2005 will have a
material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In December 2004 the FASB issued Statement No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, which is a revision of FASB Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS 123R
supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No95, Statement of Cash Flows. Under SFAS 123R, all shared-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are to
be expensed in the financial statements based on their fair value determined by applying a fair value measurement method. As required, we will adopt SFAS 123R on July1, 2005. We are electing to use the modified prospective transition method.
The adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB 107 which provides
guidance regarding the application of SFAS 123R. SAB 107 expresses views of the staff regarding the interaction between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides the staffs views regarding the valuation of share-based
payment arrangements for public companies. In particular, SAB 107 provides guidance related to share-based payment transactions with non-employees, the transition from nonpublic to public entity status, valuation methods including assumptions such
as expected volatility and expected term, the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share-based payment arrangements, the classification of compensation expense, non-GAAP financial measures, first-time adoption of
SFAS 123R in an interim period, capitalization of compensation cost related to share-based payment arrangements, the accounting for income tax effects of share-based payment arrangements upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the modification of employee share
options prior to adoption of SFAS 123R and disclosures in Managements Discussion and Analysis MDA subsequent to adoption of SFAS 123R. 
63 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No153 SFAS 153, exchanges of Non-monetary
Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No29. SFAS 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of non-monetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS
No153 is effective for non-monetary asset exchanges beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2006. We do not believe adoption of SFAS 153 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
In June 2005, the FASB issued Statement No154 SFAS 154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB Statement No3. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and
reporting of a change in accounting principle. The new standard requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB Opinion 20 Accounting
Changes previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. We do not believe adoption of
SFAS 154 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In various areas, including revenue recognition and stock option accounting, accounting standards and practices continue to evolve. Additionally, the SEC
and the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force continue to address revenue and stock option related accounting issues. The management of Avanex believes it is in compliance with all of the rules and related guidance as they currently exist. However,
any changes to generally accepted accounting principles in these areas could impact Avanexs future accounting.  Note 2. Acquisitions  On July31, 2003, the Company acquired Alcatel Optronics France SA, a subsidiary of Alcatel that operated the optical components business of Alcatel,
to augment its optical technologies and intelligent photonic solutions product line with dense wave division multiplexing DWDM lasers, photodetectors, optical amplifiers, highspeed interface modules and key passive devices such as arrayed
waveguide multiplexers and Fiber Bragg Grating FBG filters. Alcatel also assigned and licensed certain intellectual property rights to the Company. In addition, the Company acquired certain assets of the optical components business of Corning to
augment its optical technologies and intelligent photonic solutions product line with optical amplifiers and lithium-niobate modulators. Corning also assigned and licensed certain intellectual property rights to the Company. In consideration for the
above, the Company issued shares of its common stock to Alcatel and to Corning, representing 28% 354 million shares and 17% 215 million shares, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock on a post-transaction
basis. The transactions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.  On August28, 2003, the Company acquired certain assets of Vitesse Semiconductor Corporations Optical Systems Division to enhance its presence in transponders and expand its product offerings in subsystem
products. The Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Vitesses Optical Systems Division in exchange for 14million shares of Avanex common stock. The transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.

technology on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of 3-4 years. 
65 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company allocated the purchase price of acquired companies and assets to the tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The Company engaged an independent third-party appraisal firm to assist it in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.  The purchase price for the Corning Assets and Vitesse Assets resulted in the recognition of goodwill. The primary factor contributing to the recognition
of goodwill for Vitesse Assets was the ability to integrate a workforce with technical expertise. The primary factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill for the Corning Assets included the integration of a workforce with the technical
expertise and a deeper penetration of the Companys current customer base with a broader portfolio of products. The Company expects that the goodwill for both the Corning and the Vitesse acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes in the
United States.  Note 3. Restructuring Costs  A summary of the Companys accrued restructuring liability is as

Restructuring Liability Related to Acquisitions  In fiscal
2004, the Company acquired the optical components businesses of Alcatel and Corning. As part of the acquisitions, the Company recorded restructuring liabilities at July31, 2003 with a fair value of $641 million relating to future workforce
reductions, which were included in the purchase price of the optical components businesses of Alcatel and Corning. A summary of the acquisition-related accrued liability relating to these acquisitions is as follows in thousands:  Years ended June30 2005 2004 Accrued restructuring related to acquisitions, at July1, 2004 13,135 Restructuring charges from acquisitions 64,052 Recovery 3,940 Cash payments 4,391 50,917 Accrued restructuring related to acquisitions, at June30, 2005 4,804 13,135  During fiscal 2005, it
was determined that certain estimated payments were no longer required resulting in recoveries of approximately $26 million and $13 million in the Companys European and U.S. operations, respectively. Of the $26 million recovery, $21
million was due to the Companys release from an acquisition- related liability, and $05 million was due to a change in estimate. The $13 million recovery was entirely due to Corning hiring back the employees we expected to terminate.

Other Restructuring  Over the past several years, the Company has implemented various restructuring programs to realign resources in response to
the changes in the industry and customer demand, and the Company continues to assess its current and future operating requirements accordingly. The Companys restructuring programs include centralizing global manufacturing at its operations
center in Thailand.  For the U.S. facilities in fiscal 2005,
the Company approved a work force reduction that resulted in the termination of 145 employees in order to reduce operating expenses and improve its cost structure. This reduction in force is expected to be completed by the quarter ended
March31, 2006. The costs associated with this restructuring consist primarily of severance costs. The estimate of these restructuring costs is $47 million.  The Company approved a work force reduction at its Nozay, France location in fiscal 2005 that will result in the termination
of 156 full time employees at the facility in France, leaving approximately 150 employees. The reduction in force is expected to be complete by the end of January 2006. The costs associated with this restructuring consist primarily of severance
costs. The estimate of such costs is approximately $236 million, to be paid as follows: $12 million paid in fiscal 2005; $211 million to be paid in fiscal 2006; and $13 million to be paid over the subsequent five years. The accrual for these
costs was recorded in the quarter ending June30, 2005.  In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company accrued $43 million in additional costs to expand the scope of its 2004 Erwin Park restructuring plan. This amount was offset by recoveries of $08 million after it was determined that certain
estimated payments were no longer required.  The restructurings
have resulted and will result in, among other things, a significant reduction in the size of the Companys workforce, consolidation of its facilities and increased reliance on outsourced, third-party manufacturing.  During fiscal 2004, the Company announced and implemented several
restructuring programs throughout the organization. Net restructuring expense in fiscal 2004 was $38 million, and was comprised of $79 million of accruals and charges, offset by the following recoveries:  35 million relating to an abandoned leased facility in Richardson, Texas due to the negotiation of a lease termination agreement with the landlord, which resulted in recovery.
Additionally, the Company entered into an amendment to its lease for two facilities in California, which resulted in recovery  06 million relating to sales of previously abandoned equipment  In connection with the restructured leased facilities, the Company issued warrants to purchase 60,000 shares of its common stock to the landlord amounting
to $04 million valued using the Black-Scholes method. These warrants have an exercise price of $739 per share and expire on November30, 2010.  During fiscal 2003, the Company announced the closing of its facility in Richardson, Texas and the integration of the functions in Richardson into its
facility in Fremont, California, resulting in net restructuring charges of $224 million in fiscal 2003.

Detail  Cash Equivalents, Short-term and Long-term Investments
The Company generally invests its excess cash in debt
instruments of the U.S. Treasury, government agencies and corporations with strong credit ratings. Such investments are made in accordance with the Companys investment policy, which establishes guidelines relative to diversification and
maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant losses on its debt investments.  The Company classified its investments as held-to-maturity in fiscal 2004. The Company changed its classification of investments to available-for-sale in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 as the Company did not have the positive intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity pursuant to SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The
classification change resulted in an unrealized loss of $484,000.

Company recorded charges to cost of revenue of $82 million for excess and obsolete inventory primarily due to excess inventory due to decreased demand from certain products, and from discontinued products. Management did not believe it could sell
or use this inventory in the future. In fiscal 2004, the Company recorded charges to cost of revenue of $10 million for excess and obsolete inventory primarily as a result of decreased demand for the Companys products.  The Company sold inventory previously written-off with original cost totaling
$11 million in fiscal 2005 and $12 million in fiscal 2004. The majority of this inventory sold in each year had been written-off in a prior year. As a result, cost of revenue associated with the sale of this inventory was zero.  The total cost of inventory written-off from inception to June30, 2005
is approximately $566 million, including receipts under previously accrued non-cancelable purchase obligations. Of this amount, items representing $126 million have been sold, items representing $21 million have been consumed in research and
development activities, items representing $266 million have been discarded, and items representing $153 million are on hand. The ultimate disposition of the inventory items on hand will occur as the Company continues to transition its
manufacturing to third-party manufacturers in Asia.

of fiscal 2005, management evaluated the carrying value of its investment in Gemfire shares as zero, and accordingly, recorded an impairment charge of $44 million for the full carrying amount in other expense.

Warranties  In general, the Company provides a product warranty for one year from the date of shipment. The Company accrues for the estimated costs of product
warranties during the period in which revenue is recognized. The Company estimates the costs of its warranty obligations based on its historical experience and expectation of future conditions. To the extent the Company experiences increased
warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, the Companys warranty costs will increase resulting in decreases to gross profit. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty
liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.  Changes in
the Companys product warranty accrual for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are as follows in thousands:  Years Ended June30 2005 2004 Balance at beginning of year 6,125 2,707 Acquired warranty obligations 6,643 Accrual for sales during the year 3,251 2,326 Cost of warranty repair 1,344 3,704 Adjustment to prior sales including expirations and changes in estimates 2,764 1,847 Balance at end of year 5,268 6,125  Note 6. Goodwill  Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142 prescribes a two-step process for impairment testing of goodwill. The first step screens for impairment, while the second step, measures the impairment, if any. SFAS 142 requires impairment testing based on
reporting units. Management believes that we operate in one segment, which we consider our sole reporting unit. Therefore, goodwill will continue to be tested for impairment at the enterprise level. The fair value of the enterprise, which was
determined based on our current market capitalization, exceeded its carrying value, and goodwill was determined not to be impaired at June30, 2005 and 2004. Goodwill at June30, 2005 and 2004 was $94 million.  Upon adopting SFAS 142 in fiscal 2003, the Company recognized a transitional
impairment loss of $375 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. This loss was recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change.  Note 7.

Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies  Operating Leases  In September 1999 and April 2000, the Company entered into operating leases for a corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility. Upon the expiration
of each lease in October 2009 and April 2010, the Company has an option to extend the respective lease term for an additional five-year period. In July 2004, the Company assumed certain operating leases in Europe in connection with its acquisitions.
The Company also has an operating lease for certain facilities in Newark, California which the Company no longer occupies, the remaining lease obligation of which is included in accrued restructuring costs.  Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases having

Contingencies  IPO Class Action Lawsuit  On August6, 2001, Avanex, certain of its officers and directors, and various underwriters in its initial public offering IPO were
named as defendants in a class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Beveridge v. Avanex Corporation et al., Civil Action No01-CV-7256. This action and other subsequently filed
substantially similar class actions have been consolidated into In re Avanex Corp. Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, Civil Action No01 Civ. 6890. The consolidated amended complaint in the action generally alleges that various
investment bank underwriters engaged in improper and undisclosed activities related to the allocation of shares in Avanexs IPO. Plaintiffs have brought claims for violation of several provisions of the federal securities laws against those
underwriters, and also against Avanex and certain of its directors and officers, seeking unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Avanexs common stock between February3, 2000, and December6, 2000. Various
plaintiffs have filed similar actions asserting virtually identical allegations against more than 40 investment banks and 250 other companies. All of these IPO allocation securities class actions currently pending in the Southern
District of New York have been assigned to Judge Shira A. Scheindlin for coordinated pretrial proceedings as In re Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation, 21 MC 92. On October9, 2002, the claims against Avanexs directors and
officers were dismissed without prejudice pursuant to a tolling agreement. The issuer defendants filed a coordinated motion to dismiss all common pleading issues, which the court granted in 
75 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
part and denied in part in an order dated February19, 2003. The courts order did not dismiss the Section10b or Section11 claims
against Avanex. In June 2004, a stipulation of settlement for the claims against the issuer defendants, including Avanex, was submitted to the court. On August31, 2005, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement
is subject to a number of conditions, including final approval of the court. If the settlement does not occur, and litigation against Avanex continues, Avanex believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the action vigorously.
Nevertheless, an unfavorable result in litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert managements attention and resources, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Note 10. Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pension Plans
With the acquisition of the optical components business
of Alcatel, Avanex assumed a defined benefit pension plan covering the employees in France. The benefit obligation recorded on acquisition project benefit obligation was actuarially determined.  In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
No132, the Company has analyzed the change in unfunded status between the end of the prior fiscal year and the end of the current fiscal year.

The benefit obligations of $29 million and $44 million are included in other long-term obligations
in the consolidated balance sheet at June30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The last actuarial valuation of the plan was as of June30, 2005.  The Company maintains a savings and retirement plan under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code. All employees are eligible to participate on
the first day of the month following their hire date with the Company. Under the plan, employees may contribute up to 15% of their pre-tax salaries per year but not more than the statutory limits. The Company contributes 50% of the employees
contribution up to the first 3% of compensation.  Note 11. Financing
Arrangements  Short-term Borrowings  The Company fully repaid and terminated its revolving line of credit with a
financial institution during fiscal 2005. At June30, 2004 the Company had short-term borrowings of $37 million against this line. Additionally, the line of credit secured three letters of credit totaling approximately $36 million in
aggregate relating to certain facility leases. The line bore interest at prime plus 125% and, at June30, 2004, the effective interest rate was 525%.  Other Long-term Obligations  On May19, 2005 the Company closed a private placement of $35million of the Companys 80% senior secured convertible notes and warrants
to purchase common stock. The notes may be converted into shares of the Companys common stock at the option of the holder prior to the maturity of the notes on May19, 2008. The conversion price of the notes is $121, which represents a
premium of approximately 10% over the closing price of the Companys common stock on May16, 2005. Subject to certain conditions, at any time after May19, 2007, we can automatically convert all of the outstanding notes into common
stock if the weighted average price of the common stock of Avanex equals or exceeds 175% of the conversion price for a specified period. The warrants provide holders with the right to purchase up to 8,677,689 shares of common stock and are
exercisable during the three-year period ending May19, 2008 at an exercise price of $15125 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 35% over the closing price of the Companys common stock on May16, 2005. The
conversion price of the notes and the exercise price of the warrants are each subject to adjustment upon specified events, including a broad-based anti-dilution provision that contains a floor price of $11375 subject to adjustment for stock
splits, combinations or similar events. The floor price can be eliminated upon receipt of stockholder approval, which the Company is seeking at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our obligations under the notes are secured by substantially
all of our assets, substantially all of the assets of our domestic subsidiaries, and a pledge of 65% of the capital stock of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.  The Company applied the guidance from Emerging Issues Task Force, EITF Issue 98-5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial
Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios and EITF Issue 00-27, Application of Issue 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments in accounting for the notes, the accompanying warrants and the value of the
conversion feature. The Company determined that there was no beneficial conversion.  The Company assigned a relative fair value of $36 million and $314 million to the warrants and notes, respectively, by using a Black-Scholes model and assuming a historic volatility in the Companys stock price
of 795% and a contractual term of three years for the life of the instrument. The relative fair value of the warrants increased additional paid-in-capital on the balance sheet at June30, 2005. Interest expense of $56 million was 
78 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
prepaid for two years and has been recorded in other assets. In addition, the Company capitalized $19 million related to issuance costs associated with the
notes that will be amortized as part of interest expense over the term of the notes. The Company reduced additional paid-in-capital by $260,000 related to issuance costs associated with the warrants.  Prior to registration in June 2005 of the shares of common stock that would
be received upon exercise of the warrants, the Company accounted for the value of the warrants as a liability in accordance with the interpretive guidance in EITF Issue No05-4, The Effect of a Liquidated Damages Clause on a Freestanding
Financial Instrument Subject to EITF Issue No. 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock. Upon the registration of the shares, the Company realized a gain of
$740,000 and reclassified value of the warrants to equity. The consensus has not been finalized.  In January 2004, the Company entered into an installment payment agreement with a financial institution whereby the financial institution agreed to loan
the Company an aggregate principal amount of $865,000 to finance the purchase of SAP software, which is collateral for the outstanding loan under the agreement. The designated interest rate for the loan is 52% and the maturity date for the loan is
November28, 2006. The outstanding balance on the loan was $450,000 and $730,000 as of June30, 2005 and June30, 2004, respectively.  In February 2001, the Company entered into a loan agreement with a financial institution to borrow $2,269,000 to be used to finance equipment, which is
collateral for the outstanding loan under the agreement. The loan, which bore interest at 9406% was fully repaid as of March31, 2005, and had an outstanding balance of $126,000 as of June30, 2004.  Payments due under financing arrangements as of June30, 2005 are as
follows in thousands:  Years ending June30 2006 313 2007 390 2008 37,567 Total payments 38,270 Less: Amounts representing interest 2,820 Present value of net remaining payments 35,450 Less current portion 296 Long-term portion 35,154  Capital Lease Obligations
The Company leases certain of its equipment and other
fixed assets under capital lease agreements. The assets and liabilities under capital leases are recorded at the lesser of the present value of aggregate future minimum lease payments, including estimated bargain purchase options, or the fair value
of the assets under lease. Assets under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the assets.  In connection with the acquisition of the optical components business of Alcatel, the Company assumed additional capital lease obligations totaling $74
million as of June30, 2004 at interest rates ranging from 31% to 77% with varying maturity dates through fiscal 2010.

respectively. The lease agreements are payable in monthly installments through August 2009, bearing interest at rates between 31% and 77%per annum, and are fully secured by the related equipment.  Note 12. Stockholders Equity  Securities Purchase Agreements  In November 2003, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement
pursuant to which investors purchased 6,815,555 shares of the Companys common stock at a price of $463 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $315 million. Net proceeds from this transaction amounted to approximately $296 million
after payment of fees to financial and legal advisors and other direct costs. In connection with the issuance of the shares of common stock, the investors were issued rights, which were exercisable for up to an additional 1,363,116 shares of its
common stock at $463 per share. During fiscal 2004, 193,584 shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of certain of such rights. The remainder of the rights expired on March16, 2004.  In February 2004, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement
pursuant to which investors purchased 7,319,761 shares of the Companys common stock at a price of $549 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $402 million. Net proceeds from this transaction amounted to approximately $387 million
after payment of fees to financial and legal advisors and other direct costs. In connection with the issuance of the shares of common stock, the investors were issued rights that were exercisable for up to an additional 1,463,954 shares of the
Companys common stock at $549 per share, none of which were exercised. These rights expired on June9, 2004.  Stock Option and Stock Rights Plans  The Company adopted the 1998 Stock Plan the Option Plan, under which officers, employees, directors, and consultants may be granted options
to purchase shares of the Companys common stock. The Option Plan 
80 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
permits options to be granted at an exercise price of not less than the fair value on the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors. Options are
generally granted with ten-year terms and four-year vesting periods.  The authorized shares under the Option Plan automatically increase each July1 by an amount equal to the lesser of i6,000,000 shares, ii49% of the Companys outstanding shares, or iiia smaller amount
determined by the Companys Board of Directors. A total of 8,807,483 shares of the Companys common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the Option Plan as of June30, 2005.  In January 2000, the Company adopted the 1999 Director Option Plan the
Director Plan. Non-employee directors are entitled to participate in the Director Plan. The Director Plan generally provides for an automatic initial grant of an option to purchase 40,000 shares of Avanex common stock to each
non-employee director on the date when a person first becomes a non-employee director. After the initial grant, each non-employee director will automatically be granted subsequent options to purchase 20,000 shares of the Companys common stock
each year on the date of the Companys annual stockholders meeting. Grants generally shall have a term of 10 years. Each initial option grant will vest as to 25% of the shares subject to the option on each anniversary of its date of
grant. Each subsequent option grant will fully vest on the anniversary of its date of grant. The exercise price of all options will be the fair market value per share of Avanex common stock on the date of grant.  The Director Plan also provides for automatic annual increases each
July1, by an amount equal to the lesser of i150,000 shares, ii025% of the outstanding shares on that date, or iiia smaller amount determined by the Companys Board of Directors. A total of 600,000 shares of the
Companys common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan as of June30, 2005.  Stock option activity under the Option Plans and the Director Plan is as follows:  Outstanding Options NumberofShares Weighted-AverageExercisePrice

the Company may also grant share purchase rights either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Option Plan and/or cash awards granted outside the Option Plan. Exercise of these share purchase rights are made pursuant
to restricted stock purchase agreements containing provisions established by the Board of Directors. These provisions give the Company the right to repurchase the shares at the original sales price. This right expires at a rate determined by the
Board of Directors, generally at a rate of 25% after one year and 1/48per month thereafter. There were no share purchase rights issued in the years ended June30, 2005, 2004 and 2003. As of June30, 2005 there were no shares subject
to repurchase. For the year ended June30, 2003, the Company repurchased 1,098,784 under the Option Plan. No shares were repurchased for the years ended June30, 2004 and 2005.  The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $184, $261 and $074,
respectively.  For the years ended June30, 2005, 2004,
and 2003, the Company recorded deferred stock compensation of $0, $643,000, and $0, respectively, representing the difference between the exercise price and the fair value for accounting purposes of the Companys common stock on the date such
stock options were granted. The fair value of stock options granted was based on the actual stock closing price on the day previous to the date of grant. For the years ended June30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded amortization
recovery of deferred stock compensation of $243,000, $875,000 and $385,000, respectively. At June30, 2005, the Company had $353,000 of remaining unamortized deferred compensation. Such amount is included as a reduction of
stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting period.  On June28, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested and out-of-the-money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $260
per share previously awarded to its employees, including its executive officers, under Avanexs 1998 Stock Plan. The acceleration of vesting was effective for stock options outstanding as of June28, 2005. Options to purchase approximately
59million shares of common stock or 38% of Avanexs outstanding unvested options of which options to purchase approximately 900,000 shares or 6% of Avanexs outstanding unvested options were held by executive officers and were
subject to the acceleration. The weighted-average exercise price of the options subject to the acceleration was $356.  1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In January 2000, the Company adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase Plan for its employees. The Stock Purchase
Plan permits participants to purchase the Companys common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of the participants compensation. The maximum number of 
82 Table of Contents AVANEX CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
shares a participant may purchase during each offering period is 3,000 shares. The price of common stock purchases will be 85% of the lower of the fair
market value at the beginning of the offering period and the ending of the offering period.  The Stock Purchase Plan provides for automatic annual increases each July1, to shares reserved for issuance by an amount equal to the lesser of i750,000 shares, ii1% of the outstanding shares on
that date, or iiia smaller amount determined by the Companys Board of Directors. A total of 1,869,058 shares of the Companys common stock have been reserved for future issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan as of June30,

inception for all jurisdictions.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets are as follows in thousands:  Year Ended June 30 2005 2004 Deferred tax assets liabilities Net operating loss carryforwards 148,960 89,110 Tax credit carryforwards 5,047 4,074 Inventory reserves 8,715 8,251 Restructuring charges 7,080 8,522 Other 6,852 6,351 Goodwill 445 227 Total deferred tax assets liabilities 176,209 116,081 Valuation allowance 176,209 116,081 Net deferred tax assets liabilities  Realization of the
deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $60 million 40 million, and $13 million in the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards at June 30, 2005 include approximately $150 million associated with stock option activity for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will be
credited directly to stockholders equity.  As of June 30,
2005, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $236,300,000 which expire beginning in the year 2012 through 2025. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$184,220,000 which expire beginning in the year 2009. The Company also has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $162,500,000 which expire beginning in the year 2006. The Company also has federal and state research and development
tax credits of $2,689,000 and $2,820,000. The federal research credits will begin to expire in the year 2013 through 2024 and the state research credits have no expiration date.  Utilization of the Companys net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership
change limitation provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization.  We have not provided for US Federal income taxes of non-US subsidiaries
undistributed earnings, if any, because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations outside of the United States.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as of June30, 2005.  Based upon
that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June30, 2005 because of the material weaknesses discussed below. 
b Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP. Internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.  Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2005. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Managements assessment identified the following control
deficiencies that constitute material weaknesses, as described below. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  1. Inadequate company-level controls. We did not maintain effective company-level controls as defined in the COSO framework. Specifically,  We had insufficient technical accounting expertise to record complex transactions in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This resulted in errors in the accounting of our pension plan and the
recently issued 80% senior secured convertible notes due 2008. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, an effective secondary review of technical accounting matters was not performed; 
87 Table of Contents During fiscal 2005, we had very high employee turnover in the accounting department. This has resulted in a lack of familiarity with historical accounting entries, especially around
purchase accounting; and  During the fiscal 2005 year-end close process, there were a significant number of late post-close journal entries that cast doubt on the robustness of the internal controls over the
accounting close process. These deficiencies
resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected.  2. Inadequate controls at our subsidiary location in Nozay, France. Specifically, there was:  No evidence of management review of the monthly financial statements;  No evidence of review of journal entries;  No management oversight over the outsourced inventory management system;  No evidence of management approval for the return of goods;  No evidence of management review of wire transfers;  Inadequate restricted system access to the accounting system;  No evidence of review and approval of any customer credits;  No evidence of management review of certain balance sheet and income statement reconciliations;  No evidence of management review of a number of inventory and production activities including standard costs, production/inventory activities, variances and receiving; and
No evidence of approval of customer credits or ongoing analysis of credit limits.  These deficiencies resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial
statements would not be prevented or detected.  We intend to
de-emphasize activities at our Nozay, France location in fiscal 2006, which will substantially eliminate most shipping and receiving activities at that location. This, in turn, will change the requirements for our internal control over financial
reporting at this location. We intend to remediate our internal control over financial reporting at this location as appropriate for the restructured site during fiscal 2006.  3. Inadequate review procedures over journal entries. Journal entries were not always independently or adequately
reviewed. This resulted in errors being recorded in our financial statements that were detected by management very late in the close process or that resulted in audit adjustments. These errors included the incorrect classification of investments and
errors in the restructuring accrual.  This deficiency resulted
in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected.  4. Inadequate controls over the disbursement of funds. Specifically, wire transfers from our operating cash and investment accounts were made with
inadequate approvals, and a check that had not been signed was mailed to and cashed by the vendor.  These weaknesses increase the likelihood that unauthorized disbursements could occur and not be detected in a timely manner. This deficiency resulted in
more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected.  5. Inadequate controls over inventory. Specifically, commitments to purchase inventory were made with inadequate approvals, and the review of
purchase orders did not follow established policy. 
88 Table of Contents
This weakness increases the likelihood that unauthorized disbursements could occur and not be detected in
a timely manner. This deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected.  6. Inadequate controls over income tax provision. Specifically, the Company did not effectively review the income tax
provision and related disclosures, which resulted in adjustments being made to the tax computation and related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.  This deficiency increases the likelihood that a material misstatement in the tax computation and related disclosures would
not be prevented or detected.  7. Inadequate management
review and reconciliation of output from the outsourced stock option administration organization. Specifically, the Company did not systematically review reports from the outsourced stock option administrator regarding stock transactions.
This weakness increases the likelihood that significant
transactions could be processed erroneously or incorrectly, that would not be identified in a timely manner. This deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would
not be prevented or detected.  Because of the material
weaknesses described above, management concluded that, as of June30, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the COSO criteria.  Deloitte and Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited managements assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte and Touche LLP issued an audit report thereon, which is included beginning on page 47 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.  c Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management is treating these material weaknesses very seriously and has
undertaken or intends to undertake the following actions to remediate them:  We have retained experienced consultants to evaluate the accounting close process, to make recommendations to strengthen the design and implementation of our internal controls and
to provide the necessary technical and management expertise;  We intend to reduce our reliance on temporary consultants by hiring permanent staff with the requisite technical accounting skills, especially in the areas of corporate accounting
and external financial reporting. The hiring of permanent staff will provide the necessary stability required for an effective control environment;  We intend to de-emphasize our activities at Nozay, France in fiscal 2006. The restructuring of Nozay, France will substantially eliminate most shipping and receiving activities.
This, in turn, will change the requirements for many financial controls. We intend to design and implement financial controls appropriate for the restructured site during fiscal 2006;  We intend to design and implement more rigorous controls over the preparation and review of our income tax provision and disclosures;  We intend to design and implement more rigorous controls over our stock option administration;  We intend to design and implement more rigorous review procedures over journal entries;  We intend to design and implement more rigorous controls over the disbursement of funds to ensure that we follow our written disbursements policy; and  We intend to design and implement more rigorous controls over the purchase of inventory to ensure that we follow our policy. 
89 Table of Contents
These changes are part of our overall program which management intends to complete by June 30, 2006.
During the fiscal quarter ended June30, 2005, there was
no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
