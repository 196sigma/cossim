33 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Boards of Directors and Shareholders of
DTE Energy Company and
The Detroit Edison Company
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of DTE Energy Company and
subsidiaries and of The Detroit Edison Company and subsidiaries together, the
Companies as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders' equity for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Companies' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DTE Energy Company
and subsidiaries and of The Detroit Edison Company and subsidiaries at December
31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements of the Companies taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

44 DTE ENERGY COMPANY AND THE DETROIT EDISON COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- 
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- 
CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
DTE Energy Company Company, a Michigan corporation incorporated in 1995, is an
exempt holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The Company
has no significant operations of its own, holding instead the stock of The
Detroit Edison Company Detroit Edison, an electric public utility regulated by
the Michigan Public Service Commission MPSC and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission FERC, and other energy-related businesses. On January 1, 1996, the
holders of Detroit Edison common stock exchanged such stock on a
share-for-share basis for the common stock of the Company; and certain Detroit
Edison subsidiaries were transferred to the Company in the form of a dividend.
The Company and Detroit Edison consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries.
Investments in limited liability companies, partnerships and joint ventures are
accounted for using the equity method. All significant inter-company balances
and transactions have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REGULATION AND REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Detroit Edison transmission and distribution business meets the criteria of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. This accounting standard recognizes the
cost based ratemaking process which results in differences in the application of
generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and non-regulated
businesses. SFAS No. 71 requires the recording of regulatory assets and
liabilities for transactions that would have been treated as revenue and expense
in non-regulated businesses. Detroit Edison regulatory assets and liabilities
are being amortized to revenue and expense as they are included in rates.
Continued applicability of SFAS No. 71 requires that rates be designed to
recover specific costs of providing regulated services and products and that it
be reasonable to assume that rates are set at levels that will recover a
utility costs and can be charged to and collected from customers.                    44
45
MPSC Orders issued in 1997 and 1998 have altered the regulatory process in
Michigan and provide a plan for transition to competition for the generation
business of Detroit Edison. In guidance issued in 1997, the Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB concluded that
the application of SFAS No. 71 to a separable portion of a business which is
subject to a deregulation plan should cease when legislation is passed and/or a
rate order is issued that contains sufficient detail on a transition plan. Since
MPSC Orders issued through December 31, 1998 contain sufficient detail on a
transition plan, effective December 31, 1998 Detroit Edison generation
business no longer met the criteria of SFAS No. 71. Detroit Edison did not write
off any regulatory assets as a result of the discontinuation of SFAS No. 71 for
its generation business, because EITF No. 97-4, Deregulation of the Pricing of
Electricity - Issues Related to the Application of FASB Statement No. 71,
Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, and No. 101,
Regulated Enterprises - Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of
FASB Statement No. 71, permits the recording of regulatory assets which are
expected to be recovered through regulated rates. A December 1998 MPSC Order
authorized the recovery of an additional regulatory asset equal to the net book
value of Fermi 2 at December 31, 1998. See the following table of regulatory
assets and liabilities and Note 2 for further details.
Detroit Edison has recorded the following regulatory assets and liabilities at

UNAMORTIZED NUCLEAR COSTS - See Note 2.
UNAMORTIZED LOSS ON REACQUIRED DEBT
In accordance with MPSC regulations applicable to Detroit Edison, the discount,
premium and expense related to debt redeemed with refunding are amortized over
the life of the replacement issue or if related to the generation business
amortized through 2007. Discount, premium and expense on future early
redemptions of debt will be charged to earnings if they relate to the generation
business of Detroit Edison or the non-regulated businesses of the Company.
RECOVERABLE INCOME TAXES
Recoverable income taxes, a regulatory asset, represent future revenue recovery
from customers for deferred income taxes recorded upon the adoption of SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, in 1993. At that time, an increase in
accumulated deferred income tax liabilities was recorded representing the tax
effect of temporary differences not previously recognized and the recomputation
of the tax liability at the current tax rate. The MPSC issued an Order providing
assurance that the effects of previously flowed-through tax benefits will
continue to be allowed rate recovery.
POWER SUPPLY COST RECOVERY PSCR
State legislation provides Detroit Edison a mechanism, subject to MPSC approval,
for recovery of changes in power supply costs for purchased power and generation
based on a reconciliation of actual costs and usage.
FERMI 2 PHASE-IN PLAN
SFAS No. 92, Regulated Enterprises - Accounting for Phase-in Plans, permits
the capitalization of costs deferred for future recovery under a phase-in plan.
Based on a MPSC authorized phase-in plan, Detroit Edison recorded a receivable
totaling $5065 million from 1988 through 1992. Beginning in 1993 and ending in
1998, these amounts were amortized to operating expense as they were included in
rates. Amortization of these amounts totaled $84 million, $112 million, and $102
million in, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
FERMI 2 DEFERRED AMORTIZATION
Effective December 31, 1998 deferred amounts are included in unamortized nuclear
costs.
1997 STORM DAMAGE COSTS
The costs of major storms in 1997, as authorized by the MPSC, were deferred and
are amortized into expense in 1998 and 1999 as they are recovered through rates.                    46
47 UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS
Investment tax credits utilized, which relate to utility property, were deferred
and are amortized over the estimated composite service life of the related
property.
FERMI 2 CAPACITY FACTOR PERFORMANCE STANDARD
The MPSC has established a capacity factor performance standard which provides
for the disallowance of net incremental replacement power cost if Fermi 2 does
not perform to certain operating criteria. A disallowance is imposed for the
amount by which the Fermi 2 three-year rolling average capacity factor is less
than the greater of either the average of the top 50% of U.S. boiling water
reactors or 50%. An estimate of the incremental cost of replacement power is
required in computing the reserve for amounts due customers under this
performance standard.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers
investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
RESTRICTED CASH
Cash maintained for debt service requirements and other contractual obligations
is classified as restricted cash.
REVENUES
Detroit Edison records unbilled revenues for electric and steam heating services
provided after cycle billings through month-end.                    47

Utility properties are stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairment losses. In general, the cost of properties retired in the normal
course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and the cost of new property
installed, which replaces property retired, is charged to property accounts. The
annual provision for utility property depreciation is calculated on the
straight-line remaining life method by applying annual rates approved by the
MPSC to the average of year-beginning and year-ending balances of depreciable
property by primary plant accounts. Provision for depreciation of Fermi 2,
excluding decommissioning expense, was 325% of average depreciable property for
1998, 1997 and 1996. Provision for depreciation of all other utility plant, as a
percent of average depreciable property, was 329% for 1998, 1997 and 1996.                    48
49 Non-utility property is stated at original cost. Depreciation is computed over
the estimated useful lives using straight-line and declining-balance methods.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed based on market
factors and operational considerations for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable.
SOFTWARE COSTS
The Company capitalizes the cost of software developed for internal use. These
costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a five-year period beginning
with the project completion.
CAPITALIZATION - DISCOUNT AND COST
The discount and cost related to the issuance of long-term debt are amortized
over the life of each issue.
FERMI 2 REFUELING OUTAGES
Detroit Edison recognizes the cost of Fermi 2 refueling outages over periods in
which related revenues are recognized. Under this procedure, a provision is
recorded for incremental costs anticipated to be incurred during the next
scheduled Fermi 2 refueling outage.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method. Compensation expense is not recorded for stock options granted with an
exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant. For grants
of restricted stock, compensation equal to the market value of the shares at the
date of grant is deferred and amortized to expense over the vesting period.
ACCOUNTING FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
Trading activities of DTE Energy Trading, Inc. DTE ET, an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, are accounted for using the mark-to-market
method of accounting. Under such method, DTE ET energy trading contracts,
including both transactions for physical delivery and financial instruments, are
recorded at market value. The resulting unrealized gains and losses from changes
in market value of open positions are recorded as assets or liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Current period changes in the assets or liabilities
are recognized as net gains or losses in Operating Revenues on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Realized gains and losses are also recognized
in Operating Revenues. The market prices used to value these transactions
reflect management best estimate considering various                     49
50 factors, including closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value
and volatility factors underlying the commitments.
Detroit Edison continues to account for its forward purchase and sale
commitments and over-the-counter options on a settlement basis.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the 1998
presentation.
NOTE 2 - REGULATORY MATTERS
- 
Detroit Edison is subject to the primary regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC,
which, from time to time, issues its Orders pertaining to Detroit Edison
conditions of service, rates and recovery of certain costs including the costs
of generating facilities. MPSC Orders issued December 1988, January 1994,
November 1997 and December 1998 are currently in effect with respect to Detroit
Edison rates and certain other revenue, accounting, and operating-related
matters.
ELECTRIC INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING
There are ongoing proceedings for the restructuring of the Michigan electric
public utility industry and the implementation of a direct access program. In
1997 and 1998, the MPSC issued several Orders relating to direct access and
competition.
In July 1998, Detroit Edison filed an application with the MPSC, indicating that
accelerated amortization of Detroit Edison Fermi 2 assets was necessary to
provide a reasonable opportunity for Detroit Edison to recover its investment in
those assets. In a December 28, 1998 Order, the MPSC authorized the accelerated
amortization of the remaining net book balances as of December 31, 1998 of
Fermi 2 and its associated regulatory assets in a manner that will provide an
opportunity for full recovery under current base rates, taking into account the
related tax consequences, of those assets by December 31, 2007.
The December 28, 1998 Order imposed six conditions for the recovery by Detroit
Edison of accelerated amortization of Fermi 2 and required a signed acceptance.
In a January 15, 1999 response, Detroit Edison requested a clarifying Order from
the MPSC. Subject to receipt of the requested clarifying Order, Detroit Edison
has -  reduced its rates by application of a credit equal to 2787% $938 
million annually of base rates, effective January 1, 1999 -  indicated it will reduce its jurisdictional retail rates by removing the
Fermi 2 regulatory asset, referred to in Note 1 as unamortized nuclear
costs, from rate base on a pro rata jurisdictional rate basis when such
asset reaches zero, which is currently anticipated to occur January 1,
2008 -  indicated that while it has no plans to sell Fermi 2, should such a sale
occur, it will return to customers the difference between Fermi 2 net
book value at the time of                     50
51   sale and the actual sale price; and the MPSC will
be advised of a purchase of Detroit Edison during the accelerated
amortization period so that the MPSC may determine whether the proposed
transaction is in the public interest and properly balances the interests
of investors and customers -  agreed that should Detroit Edison seek to abandon Fermi 2 which Detroit
Edison has no plans to do during the accelerated amortization period, and
only if electric generation has not been deregulated by either Michigan
state or federal action, Detroit Edison will initiate a contested case
proceeding before the MPSC seeking approval of the abandonment -  agreed to fully abide by the direct access program and schedule
established by the MPSC in previous restructuring orders; and
- -  indicated that if its earned rate of return exceeds its authorized rate of
return during the period of time that amortization of Fermi 2 is being
accelerated, it will apply 50% of the excess earnings to reduce its
stranded investment.
Petitions for rehearing on the December 28, 1998 MPSC Order have been filed by
several parties.
ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS
Detroit Edison accounts for its transmission and distribution business in
accordance with SFAS No. 71 which requires recognition of the effects of rate
regulation in the financial statements. Continued application of SFAS No. 71 by
Detroit Edison requires: 1 third party regulation of rates, 2 cost-based
rates and 3 a reasonable assumption that all costs will be recoverable from
customers through rates.
In 1997, the FASB issued EITF No. 97-4. The EITF indicated that: 1 an entity
should cease to apply SFAS No. 71 no later than the date the specific
deregulation plan is ordered by legislation or by a regulatory authority and the
details of the plan are known, and 2 both stranded costs and regulated assets
and liabilities should continue to be recognized to the extent that the
transition plan provides for their recovery through a separate regulated
business.
Detroit Edison believes that the restructuring orders provide sufficient details
regarding the transition to competition for its electric generation business and
therefore SFAS No. 71 should no longer be applied to that business. Accordingly,
effective December 31, 1998, Detroit Edison adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
101, Regulated Enterprises-Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of
FASB Statement No. 71, for its electric generation business. SFAS No. 101
requires an evaluation to be performed to determine whether or not indications
of impairment exist for plant assets under SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,
and the elimination of certain effects of rate regulation that have been
recognized as assets or liabilities pursuant to SFAS No. 71.
At December 31, 1998 Detroit Edison performed an impairment test of its Fermi 2
nuclear generation plant and related regulatory assets pursuant to SFAS No. 121.
The impairment test for Fermi 2 indicated that it was fully impaired. Therefore,
the Fermi 2                     51
52 plant asset and its related regulatory assets were written off. At December 31,
1998, the accumulation of future regulatory recovery for Fermi 2 assets from
bundled customers and transition surcharges from unbundled customers was
calculated. Since the December 28, 1998 MPSC Order provides for full recovery of
Fermi 2, a regulatory asset was established which will be amortized through
December 31, 2007. There was no impact on income from the write off of the Fermi
2 plant assets and subsequent recording of the regulatory asset for unamortized
nuclear costs.
A summary of the regulatory asset established at December 31, 1998 is shown in
the following table

1988 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
The December 1988 MPSC Order established for the period January 1989 through
December 2003: 1 a cap on Fermi 2 capital additions of $25 million per year, in
1988 dollars adjusted by the Consumers Price Index CPI, cumulative, 2 a cap
on Fermi 2 non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses adjusted by the CPI and
3 a capacity factor performance standard based on a three-year rolling average
commencing in 1991. For a capital investment of $200 million or more in 1988
dollars adjusted by the CPI, Detroit Edison must obtain prior MPSC approval to
include the investment in rate base. Under the cap on Fermi 2 capital
expenditures, the cumulative amount available totals $72 million in 1998
dollars at December 31, 1998. Under the cap on Fermi 2 non-fuel operation and
maintenance expenses, the cumulative amount available totals $105 million in
1998 dollars at December 31, 1998.
Under the December 1988 Order, if nuclear operations at Fermi 2 permanently
cease, amortization in rates of a $513 million investment in Fermi 2 would
continue and the remaining net rate base investment amount would be removed from
rate base and amortized in rates, without return, over 10 years with such
amortization not to exceed $290 million per year. The December 1988 and January
1994 Orders do not address the costs of decommissioning if the operations at
Fermi 2 prematurely cease.
In accordance with a November 1997 MPSC Order, Detroit Edison reduced revenues
by $53 million to reflect the scheduled reduction in the revenue requirement for
Fermi 2, in accordance with the 1988 settlement agreement. The $53 million
decrease is included in the $938 million decrease effective January 1, 1999. In
addition, the November 1997 MPSC Order authorized the deferral of $30 million of
1997 storm                     52
53 damage costs and amortization and recovery of the costs over a 24-month
period commencing January 1998. In December 1997, the Association of Businesses
Advocating Tariff Equity in Michigan and the Residential Ratepayer Consortium
filed a lawsuit in Ingham County Circuit Court contending that Detroit Edison
and the MPSC breached the December 1988 MPSC Order by offsetting the stipulated
revenue reduction with the amortization of the storm costs. The Michigan
Attorney General has filed an appeal of the November 1997 Order in the Michigan
Court of Appeals.
NOTE 3 - FERMI 2
- 
GENERAL
Fermi 2, a nuclear generating unit, began commercial operation in January 1988.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC maintains jurisdiction over the
licensing and operation of Fermi 2. Fermi 2 has a design electrical rating net
of 1,150 megawatts MW. This unit represents approximately 12% of total
operation and maintenance expenses and 11% of summer net rated capability. The
net book balance of the Fermi 2 plant was written off at December 31, 1998 and
an equivalent regulatory asset was established.
Ownership of an operating nuclear generating unit subjects Detroit Edison to
significant additional risks. Fermi 2 is regulated by a number of different
governmental agencies concerned with public health, safety and environmental
protection. Consequently, Fermi 2 is subjected to greater scrutiny than a
conventional fossil-fueled plant. See Note 2.
INSURANCE
Detroit Edison insures Fermi 2 with property damage insurance provided by
Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited NEIL. The NEIL insurance policies provide
$500 million of composite primary coverage with a $1 million deductible and
$225 billion of excess coverage, respectively, for stabilization,
decontamination and debris removal costs, repair and/or replacement of property
and decommissioning. Accordingly, the combined limits provide total property
damage insurance of $275 billion.
Detroit Edison maintains insurance policies with NEIL providing for extra
expenses, including certain replacement power costs necessitated by Fermi 2
unavailability due to an insured event. These policies have a 17-week waiting
period and provide for three years of coverage.
Under the NEIL policies, Detroit Edison could be liable for maximum
retrospective assessments of up to approximately $20 million per loss if any one
loss should exceed the accumulated funds available to NEIL.
As required by federal law, Detroit Edison maintains $200 million of public
liability insurance for a nuclear incident. Further, under the Price-Anderson
Amendments Act of 1988, deferred premium charges of $839 million could be
levied against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $10 million per
year per facility. On December 31,                     53
54 1998, there were 109 licensed nuclear facilities in the United States. Thus,
deferred premium charges in the aggregate amount of approximately $91 billion
could be levied against all owners of licensed nuclear facilities in the event
of a nuclear incident at any of these facilities.
DECOMMISSIONING
The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and
requires decommissioning funding based upon a formula. The MPSC and FERC
regulate the recovery of costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both
require the use of external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi
2. Base rates approved by the MPSC provide for the decommissioning costs of
Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is continuing to fund FERC jurisdictional amounts for
decommissioning even though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates.
Detroit Edison believes that the MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate to
fund the estimated cost of decommissioning using the NRC formula.
Detroit Edison has established external trust funds to hold decommissioning and
low-level radioactive waste disposal funds collected from customers. During
1998, 1997 and 1996 Detroit Edison collected $362 million, $355 million and
$377 million, respectively, from customers for decommissioning and low-level
radioactive waste disposal. Such amounts were recorded as components of
depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income
and in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1998
and in accumulated depreciation and amortization at December 31, 1997. Net
unrealized gains of $368 million and $315 million in 1998 and 1997,
respectively, were recorded as increases to the nuclear decommissioning trust
funds and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31,
1998 and in accumulated depreciation and amortization at December 31, 1997.
At December 31, 1998, Detroit Edison had a reserve of $2656 million for the
future decommissioning of Fermi 2 and $111 million for low-level radioactive
waste disposal costs. These reserves are included in other liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1998 and in accumulated depreciation
and amortization at December 31, 1997, with a like amount deposited in external
trust funds. It is estimated that the cost of decommissioning Fermi 2 when its
license expires in the year 2025 will be $649 million in 1998 dollars and $3
billion in 2025 dollars using a 6% inflation rate.
Detroit Edison also had a reserve of $321 million at December 31, 1998 for the
future decommissioning of Fermi 1, an experimental nuclear unit on the Fermi 2
site that has been shut down since 1972. This reserve is included in other
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a like amount deposited in an
external trust fund. Detroit Edison estimates that the cost of decommissioning
Fermi 1 in the year 2025 is between $29 million and $32 million in 1998 dollars 
and between $146 million and $161 million in 2025 dollars using a 6% inflation 
rate.
The FASB is reviewing the accounting for obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets, including decommissioning of nuclear power
plants.                    54
55
CAPACITY FACTOR PERFORMANCE STANDARD
The capacity factor disallowance for 1997 has not yet been determined by the
MPSC. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, Detroit Edison had accruals of $856
million and $74 million, respectively, for the Fermi 2 capacity factor
performance standard disallowances that are expected to be imposed by the MPSC
during the period 1997-2003.
NUCLEAR FUEL DISPOSAL COSTS
In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Detroit Edison
has a contract with the United States Department of Energy DOE for the future
storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is
obligated to pay DOE a fee of one mill per net kilowatthour of Fermi 2
electricity generated and sold. The fee is a component of nuclear fuel expense.
Delays have occurred in the DOE program for the acceptance and disposal of
spent nuclear fuel at a permanent repository. Until the DOE is able to fulfill
its obligation under the contract, Detroit Edison is responsible for the spent
nuclear fuel storage and estimates that existing storage capacity will be
sufficient until the year 2001, or until 2015 with expansion of such storage
capacity.

58 In September 1997, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend
distribution of one right Right for each share of Company common stock
outstanding. Under certain circumstances, each Right entitles the shareholder to
purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Company Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock at a price of $90. The Right is transferable apart from the
Company common stock until 10 days following a public announcement that a person
or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 10% or more of outstanding Company
common shares, or the commencement or announcement of a reclassification, merger
or consolidation which would result in a 10% plus shareholder increasing its
ownership of the Company more than 1%. If the acquiring person or group acquires
10% or more of the Company common stock, and the Company survives, each Right
other than those held by the acquirer will entitle its holder to buy Company
common stock having a value of $180 for $90. If the acquiring person or group
acquires 10% or more of the Company common stock, and the Company does not
survive, each Right other than those held by the surviving or acquiring
company will entitle its holder to buy shares of common stock of the surviving
or acquiring company having a value of $180 for $90. The Rights will expire on
October 6, 2007 unless redeemed by the Company at $001 per Right at any time
prior to an event which would permit the Rights to be exercised. The Company may
amend the Rights agreement without the approval of the holders of the Rights
Certificates, except that the redemption price may not be less than $001 per
Right.
Apart from MPSC or FERC approval and the requirement that common, preferred and
preference stock be sold for at least par value, there are no legal restrictions
on the issuance of additional authorized shares of stock by Detroit Edison.
There are no legal restrictions on the issuance of additional authorized shares
of the Company common and preferred stock.
NOTE 7 - LONG-TERM DEBT
- 
Detroit Edison 1924 Mortgage and Deed of Trust Mortgage, the lien of which
covers substantially all of Detroit Edison properties, provides for the
issuance of additional General and Refunding Mortgage Bonds Mortgage Bonds. At
December 31, 1998, approximately $38 billion principal amount of Mortgage Bonds
could have been issued on the basis of property additions, combined with an
earnings test provision, assuming an interest rate of 625% on any such
additional Mortgage Bonds. An additional $16 billion principal amount of
Mortgage Bonds could have been issued on the basis of bond retirements.
Unless an event of default has occurred, and is continuing, each series of
Quarterly Income Debt Securities QUIDS provides that interest will be paid
quarterly. However, Detroit Edison also has the right to extend the interest
payment period on the QUIDS for up to 20 consecutive interest payment periods.
Interest would continue to accrue during the deferral period. If this right is
exercised, Detroit Edison may not declare or pay dividends on, or redeem,
purchase or acquire, any of its capital stock during the deferral                     58
59
period. Detroit Edison may redeem any series of capital stock pursuant to the
terms of any sinking fund provisions during the deferral period. Additionally,
during any deferral period, Detroit Edison may not enter into any inter-company
transactions with any affiliate of Detroit Edison, including the Company, to
enable the payment of dividends on any equity securities of the Company.
At December 31, 1998, $113 million of tax exempt revenue bonds were subject to
periodic remarketings within one year. Remarketing agents remarket the bonds at
the lowest interest rate necessary to produce a par bid. In the event that a tax
exempt revenue bond remarketing fails, Standby Note Purchase Agreements and/or
Letters of Credit provide that banks will purchase the bonds and, after the
conclusion of all necessary proceedings, remarket the bonds. In the event the
banks' obligations under the Standby Note Purchase Agreements and/or Letters of
Credit are not honored, then, Detroit Edison would be required to purchase any
bonds subject to a failed remarketing.

NOTE 8 - SHORT-TERM CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS
- 
At December 31, 1998, Detroit Edison had total short-term credit arrangements of
approximately $685 million, under which $231 million was outstanding. At
December 31, 1997 there were no amounts outstanding. The weighted average
interest rates for short-term borrowings during 1998, 1997 and 1996 were 57 57% and 56%, respectively.
Detroit Edison had bank lines of credit of $201 million, all of which had
commitment fees in lieu of compensating balances. Detroit Edison uses bank lines
of credit and other credit facilities to support the issuance of commercial
paper and bank loans. Detroit Edison had $231 million of commercial paper
outstanding at December 31, 1998. Detroit Edison had no commercial paper
outstanding at December 31, 1997.
Detroit Edison had a nuclear fuel financing arrangement heat purchase contract
with Renaissance Energy Company Renaissance, an unaffiliated company.
Renaissance may issue commercial paper or borrow from participating banks on the
basis of promissory notes. To the extent the maximum amount of funds available
to Renaissance currently $400 million is not needed by Renaissance to purchase
nuclear fuel, such funds may be loaned to Detroit Edison for general corporate
purposes pursuant to a separate Loan Agreement. At December 31, 1998,
approximately $284 million was available to Detroit Edison under such Loan
Agreement. See Note 9 for a discussion of Detroit Edison heat purchase
contract with Renaissance.
Detroit Edison had a $200 million short-term financing agreement secured by its
customer accounts receivable and unbilled revenues portfolio. Borrowings are at
prevailing money market rates. At December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997 there
were no amounts outstanding.
At December 31, 1998, DTE Capital Corporation DTE Capital, a Company
subsidiary, had short-term credit arrangements of $400 million backed by a
Support Agreement from the Company. The credit agreement provides support for
DTE Capital commercial paper. At December 31, 1998 there was no commercial
paper outstanding. At December 31, 1997 DTE Capital had short-term credit
arrangements of $200 million, backed by a Support Agreement from the Company
under which $42 million was outstanding. Also in January 1998, the Company
entered into a $60 million Support Agreement with DTE Capital for the purpose of
DTE Capital credit enhancing activities on behalf of DTE Energy affiliates.

Rental expenses for both capital and operating leases were $96 million
including $49 million for nuclear fuel, $72 million including $42 million for
nuclear fuel and $78 million including $53 million for nuclear fuel for 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively.
Detroit Edison has a heat purchase contract with Renaissance which provides for
the purchase by Renaissance for Detroit Edison of up to $400 million of nuclear
fuel, subject to the continued availability of funds to Renaissance to purchase
such fuel. Title to the nuclear fuel is held by Renaissance. Detroit Edison
makes quarterly payments under the heat purchase contract based on the
consumption of nuclear fuel for the generation of electricity.
Under SFAS No. 71, amortization of Detroit Edison leased assets is modified so
that the total of interest on the obligation and amortization of the leased
asset is equal to the rental expense allowed for ratemaking purposes. For
ratemaking purposes, the MPSC has treated all leases as operating leases. Net
income was not affected by capitalization of leases. Due to the discontinuation
of the application of SFAS No. 71 for the generation business effective December
31, 1998, prospectively, the costs of these assets will be amortized based on
their economic useful lives.
NOTE 10 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

TRADING ACTIVITIES
DTE ET markets and trades electricity and natural gas physical products and
financial instruments, and provides risk management services utilizing energy
commodity derivative instruments which include futures, exchange traded and
over-the-counter options, and forward purchase and sale commitments. The
notional amounts and terms of DTE ET outstanding energy trading financial
instruments and the fair values of DTE ET energy commodity derivative
instruments were not material at December 31, 1998.
MARKET RISK
DTE ET manages, on a portfolio basis, the market risks inherent in its
activities subject to parameters established by the Company Risk Management
Committee RMC, which is authorized by its Board of Directors. Market risks are
monitored by the RMC to                     61
62
ensure compliance with the Company stated risk management policies. DTE ET
marks its portfolio to market and measures its risk on a daily basis in
accordance with Value at Risk VaR and other risk methodologies. The
quantification of market risk using VaR provides a consistent measure of risk
across diverse energy markets and products.
CREDIT RISK
DTE ET is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by customers or
counterparties of its contractual obligations. The concentration of customers
and/or counterparties may impact overall exposure to credit risk, either
positively or negatively, in that the counterparties may be similarly affected
by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. However, DTE ET
maintains credit policies with regard to its customers and counterparties that
management believes significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies
include an evaluation of potential customers' and counterparties' financial
condition and credit rating, collateral requirements or other credit
enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees, and the use of
standardized agreements which allow for the netting or offsetting of positive
and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. Based on these
policies, the Company does not anticipate a materially adverse effect on
financial position or results of operations as a result of customer or
counterparty nonperformance. Those futures and option contracts which are traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange are financially guaranteed by the Exchange
and have nominal credit risk.
NON-TRADING ACTIVITIES
INTEREST RATE SWAPS
In October 1996, Detroit Edison entered into a three-year interest rate swap
agreement based on a notional amount of $25 million, which is nominally linked
to the Detroit Edison 1993 Series B Remarketed Notes. Detroit Edison receives a
rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and pays a rate equal to
the quarterly weighted average Public Securities Association Municipal Swap
Index divided by 673%. The intent of the swap is to shift floating rate
exposure from taxable to tax-exempt markets. In 1998 and 1997 the average rate
received was 568% and 57% and the average rate paid was 502% and 536 respectively. The net of interest received and interest paid on the swap is
accrued as a component of interest expense in the current period. The swap is
subject to market risk of changes in both interest rates and tax rates.
PCI Enterprises Company PCI, a coal pulverizing subsidiary, entered into a
seven-year interest rate swap agreement beginning June 30, 1997, with the intent
of reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate
non-recourse debt. The initial notional amount was $30 million which was based
on 60% of its term loan of $50 million. The notional amount outstanding at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, was $27 million and $292 million, respectively and
will decline throughout the term of the loan based on amortization of principal
amounts. PCI pays a fixed interest rate of 696% on the notional amount and
receives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. In 1998, and 1997, the                     62
63 average rate received was 565% and 569%, respectively. The net of interest
received and interest paid on the swap is accrued as a component of interest
expense in the current period. The swap is subject to market risk of changes in
interest rates.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various
market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The carrying amount
of financial instruments, except for long-term debt, approximates fair value.
The estimated fair value of total long-term debt at December 31, 1998 and 1997
was $48 billion and $42 billion, respectively, compared to the carrying amount
of $45 billion and $4 billion, respectively. Investments in debt and equity
securities are classified as available for sale.
NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
- 
COMMITMENTS
Detroit Edison has entered into purchase commitments of approximately $11
billion at December 31, 1998, which includes, among other things, line
construction and clearance costs and other equipment purchases. The Company and
Detroit Edison have also entered into long-term fuel supply commitments of
approximately $11 billion.
Detroit Edison has an Energy Purchase Agreement Agreement for the purchase of
steam and electricity from the Detroit Resource Recovery Facility. Under the
Agreement, Detroit Edison will purchase steam through the year 2008 and
electricity through June 30, 2024. Purchases of steam and electricity were $311
million, $343 million and $302 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Annual purchase commitments are approximately $37 million, $39 million, $40
million, $41 million and $43 million for 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
respectively. See Note 14 relating to steam heating special charge.
In October 1995, the MPSC issued an Order approving Detroit Edison six-year
capacity and energy purchase agreement with Ontario Hydro. Ontario Hydro agreed
to sell Detroit Edison 300 MW of capacity from mid-May through mid-September.
This purchase will offset a concurrent agreement to lease approximately a third
of Detroit Edison Ludington 917 MW capacity to First Energy for the same time
period. The net economic effect of Ludington lease and the Ontario Hydro
purchase is an estimated reduction in PSCR expense of $74 million which will be
refunded to Detroit Edison customers.

64 Court for Wayne County, Michigan; and Frazier v. Detroit Edison, United States
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, are preparing for binding
arbitration to settle these matters. A July 1998 Consent Judgement has received
preliminary Court approval. A Fairness Hearing with respect to the terms of the
settlement was held in August 1998, and no objections to the settlement were
raised. A second Fairness Hearing is contemplated following the results of the
arbitration. The settlement agreement provides that Detroit Edison monetary
liability is to be no less than $175 million and no greater than $65 million
after the conclusion of all related proceedings. Detroit Edison has accrued an
amount considered to be probable.
OTHER
In addition to the matters reported herein, the Company and its subsidiaries are

65 and decreasing from 59% to 5% for persons age 65 and over. A
one-percentage-point increase in health care cost trend rates would increase the
aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of benefit costs by
$10 million for 1998 and increase the accumulated benefit obligation by $85
million at December 31, 1998. A one-percentage point decrease in the health care
cost trend rates would decrease the aggregate of the service cost and interest
cost components of benefit costs by $8 million for 1998 and decrease the
accumulated benefit obligation by $70 million at December 31, 1998.
NOTE 13 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
- 
The Company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP in 1995. Under the LTIP,
certain key employees may be granted restricted common stock, stock options,
stock appreciation rights, performance shares and performance units. Common
stock granted under the LTIP may not exceed 72 million shares. Performance
units which have a face amount of $1 granted under the LTIP may not exceed 25
million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 1998, no stock appreciation rights,
performance shares or performance units have been granted under the LTIP.
Under the LTIP, shares of restricted common stock were awarded and are
restricted for a period not exceeding four years. All shares are subject to
forfeiture if specified performance measures are not met. There are no exercise
prices related to these shares. During the applicable restriction period, the
recipient has all the voting, dividend                     67
68 and other rights of a record holder except that the shares are nontransferable,
and non-cash distributions paid upon the shares would be subject to transfer
restrictions and risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the shares themselves.
The shares were recorded at the market value on the date of grant and amortized
to expense based on the award that was expected to vest and the period to which
the related employee services were to be rendered. Restricted common stock
activity for the year ended December 31 was

-  Stock options were also issued under the LTIP. Options are exercisable at a rate
of 25% per year during the four years following the date of grant. The options
will expire 10 years after the date of the grant. The option exercise price
equals the fair market value of the stock on the date that the option was
granted. Stock option activity was as follows

The Company continues to apply APB Opinion 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recorded for options
granted. As required by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
the Company has determined the pro forma information as if the Company had
accounted for                    68
69 its employee stock options under the fair value method. The fair value for these
options was estimated at the date of grant using a modified Black/Scholes option
pricing model - American style and the following weighted average assumptions  
1998       1997   
- 
Risk-free interest rate      584%       683%
Dividend yield           539%       726%
Expected volatility        1748%       1831%
Expected life           10 years      10 years
Fair value per option       $643       $415  The pro forma effect of these options would be to reduce net income by $695,000
and $244,000, for the years ending December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
There was no pro forma effect on earnings per share EPS.
NOTE 14 - STEAM HEATING SPECIAL CHARGE
- 
In 1996, a special charge to net income of $149 million $97 million after-tax
or $067 cents per share was recorded. The special charge included a reserve for
steam purchase commitments during the period from 1997 through 2008 under the
agreement with the Detroit Resource Recovery Facility, expenditures for closure
of a portion of the steam heating system and improvements in service to
remaining customers. The reserve for steam purchase commitments was recorded at
its present value, therefore Detroit Edison will record non-cash accretion
expense during the period 1997 through 2008. In addition, beginning in 1997,
amortization of the reserve for steam purchase commitments is netted against
losses on steam heating purchases recorded in fuel and purchased power expense.
NOTE 15 - SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION
- 
Effective December 31, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The Company reportable
