The Company management, including the Company Principal Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of the Company disclosure controls and procedures.
Based on that review and evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and

the end of the period covered by this report. There have been no significant
changes in the Company internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect the Company internal controls subsequent to the date
of their evaluation. There were no significant material weaknesses
identified in the course of such review and evaluation and, therefore, no
corrective measures were taken by the Company.                    14                  PART III
