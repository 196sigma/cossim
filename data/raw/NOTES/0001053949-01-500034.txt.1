In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Network Peripherals Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - THE COMPANY
Network Peripherals Inc., a Delaware corporation the Company, designs and
manufactures Layer 2 and Layer 3 functionality Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet
switching products, which it markets primarily to original equipment
manufacturers, distributors, value-added resellers and system integrators. The
Company switching products are designed for use in workgroups, wiring closets
and network backbones. NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
or remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company short-term investments consist of marketable debt securities,
substantially of which have maturities between three months and one year. All
marketable debt securities included in short-term investments have been
classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair market value, and the
unrealized gains or losses on these investments are included as a separate
component of the stockholders' equity. For the years ended December 31, 1999 and
1998, there were no material unrealized gains or losses on investments.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk, consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments and trade receivables. The Company maintains its cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments with high credit quality financial
institutions and limits its investments to those that are short-term and low
risk. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is
generally limited due to the Company on-going evaluation of its customers'
credit worthiness and the established long-term relationship with certain
customers.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from product sales is recognized when pervasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable
and collectibility is probable. The Company provides to certain distributors
limited rights of return and price protection on unsold inventory when specific
conditions exist. Provisions for estimated costs of warranty repairs, product
returns, and retroactive price adjustments are recorded at the time products are
shipped based on past experience. Allowances for uncollectible accounts
receivable are provided at the time such receivable is deemed uncollectible.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commissions issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. SAB 101 summarizes certain of the Staff views in applying
generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial
statements. The adoption of SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of 2000 did not have a
material effect on the Company results of operations or financial condition.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out
method, or market.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically three years.
Depreciation of the Company enterprise resource planning systems, its
information systems infrastructure, and certain manufacturing equipment is based
on an estimated useful life of five years. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is computed using the remaining lease term.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
identifiable net assets acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis over
the expected period of benefit, generally five years. Periodically, the Company
evaluates the goodwill for impairment and estimates the future undiscounted cash
flows of the acquired business to ensure that the carrying value has not been
impaired. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, goodwill, net of accumulated
amortization, was $53,000 and $93,000, respectively, and was included in other
assets.
Software Development Costs
The Company software products are integrated into its hardware products and
are typically available for general release to customers within 30 days after
technological feasibility has been achieved. Accordingly, the production costs
incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before general
release to customers are immaterial. The Company has not capitalized any
software development costs to date.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs
totaled $2,293,000, $634,000 and $381,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method,
which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts, and for net
operating loss and credit carryforwards. The Company records a valuation
allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such
assets will not be realized.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company subsidiaries in Taiwan and the
Netherlands is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, gains or losses arising from the
translation of foreign currency financial statements and transactions are
included in determining consolidated results of operations.
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has stock option plans and offers a 401k plan covering all of its
U.S. employees. The 401k plan provides for matching contributions determined
at the Company discretion. The Company matched 50% of each employee
contribution up to $3,000 in 2000 and $1,000 in 1999. The matching contributions
totaled $202,000 and $59,000 in 2000 and 1999, respectively. No such matching
contributions were made in 1998.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Stock-based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic
value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as permitted under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB Opinion No. 25, if the
exercise price of the Company employee stock options equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving
Stock Compensation. FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB Opinion No. 25
regarding a the definition of employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion
No. 25, b the criteria for determining whether a stock option plan qualifies
as a noncompensatory plan, c the accounting consequence of various
modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award, and d
the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business
combination. FIN 44 became effective on July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions
cover specific events that occurred after either December 15, 1998, or January
12, 2000. The adoption of FIN 44 did not have a material impact on the Company
results of operations or financial condition.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic earnings per share are computed as net earnings divided by the weighted-
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per
share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares
issuable through stock-based compensation including stock options, restricted
stock awards, warrants, and other convertible securities using the treasury
stock method. During 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company incurred net losses, such
that the inclusion of potential common shares would result in an antidilutive
per share amount. Accordingly, no adjustment is made to the basic net loss per
share to arrive at the diluted net loss per share.
Comprehensive Loss
For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company comprehensive loss included
net loss and the change in unrealized gain on investments. There were no
reconciling items between the Company net loss and comprehensive loss for the
years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.
Recent Accounting Pronouncement
In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities. SFAS No.
133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those
instruments at fair value. In June 2000, SFAS No133 was amended by SFAS No.
138, which amended or modified certain issues discussed in SFAS No. 133. The
Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 during the year ending December
31, 2001. To date, the Company has not engaged in derivative or hedging
activities. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 will have no material
impact on the Company results of operations or financial condition.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' amounts in order to
conform to the current year presentation.

The Company has elected to continue to follow APB Opinion No. 25 to account for
its employee stock options and adopted the disclosure-only requirements of SFAS
No. 123. SFAS No. 123 requires the disclosure of pro forma net income and
earnings per share as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock
options under the fair value method in accordance with SFAS No. 123. The fair
value of these options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: expected
volatilities of 110% in 2000, 93% in 1999 and 82% in 1998; risk-free interest
rates of 51% in 2000, 62% in 1999 and 46% in 1998; expected lives of 35
years in 2000 and 1999 and 25 years in 1998; and no dividend yield for all
periods.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED NOTE 9 - RESTRUCTURING
In August 2000, the Company approved and announced a plan to divest its
manufacturing facility in Taiwan. A turnkey manufacturer will manufacture all of
the Company products after the divestiture. The objective of the divestiture
is to reduce manufacturing overhead and improve gross margins by taking
advantage of the turnkey manufacturer economies of scale in materials
procurement and production capacity. The divestiture plan consisted of
terminating 57 employees in the manufacturing and the general and administrative
functions, selling manufacturing equipment and closing the manufacturing
facility. These actions resulted in a restructuring expense of $600,000, which
included $550,000 for severance and $50,000 for facility related charges. The
Company completed the divestiture in the first quarter of 2001. The following

On March 30, 2001, the Company entered into a series of related agreements with
FalconStor, Inc. FalconStor, a privately held company, pursuant to which the
Company purchased Series C Preferred Stock of FalconStor having an aggregate
purchase price of $25,000,000, and obtained an exclusive option to merge with
FalconStor. FalconStor develops and markets network storage infrastructure
software that enables storage over IP using standard industry components such as
Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel and SCSI, with planned support for iSCSI and
Infiniband. The investment agreements provide that the Company has the right to
designate one member of FalconStor board of directors and entitle the Company
to liquidation, registration, voting and preemptive rights customary for venture
capital style investments.
The option agreement gives the Company the right to merge with FalconStor. The
form of merger agreement provides that, as consideration for all outstanding
shares of FalconStor stock, the Company would issue a number of newly issued
shares of its common stock determined in accordance with a formula. The number
of shares issuable in the merger would depend upon a number of variable factors,
including the trading price per share of the Company common stock at the time
of the merger, the Company assets at the time of the merger and other factors.
The actual number of shares is expected to result in the Company current
stockholders having a one-third interest in the combined entity. In addition,
the Company would assume all outstanding options to acquire shares of
FalconStor common stock, which would result in the potential issuance of
approximately 4,500,000 shares if those options vested and were exercised. The
merger would be structured as a tax free reorganization and would be accounted
for as a purchase. Completion of the merger would be subject to the expiration
of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, stockholder approval and
other customary closing conditions. In the event that the Company does not
exercise the option, and under certain other circumstances, the Company may be
required to pay FalconStor a penalty of $3,000,000.
