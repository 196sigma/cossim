SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Presentation/Basis of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. These financial statements present the financial position and results of operations of the Company and the Offices, which are under the control of the Company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in 2008. Such reclassification had no effect on net income.
The Company treats Offices as consolidated subsidiaries where it has a long-term and unilateral controlling financial interest over the assets and operations of the Offices. The Company has obtained control of substantially all of the Offices via the Management Agreements. The Company is a business service organization and does not engage in the practice of dentistry or the provision of hygiene services. These services are provided by licensed professionals. Certain key features of these arrangements either enable the Company at any time and in its sole discretion to cause a change in the shareholder of the P.C. i.e., ''nominee shareholder'' or allow the Company to vote the shares of stock held by the owner of the P.C. and to elect a majority of the board of directors of the P.C. The accompanying statements of income reflect net revenue, which is the amount billed to patients, less dentists', dental hygienists' and dental assistants wages. Direct expenses con
sist of all the expenses incurred in operating the Offices and paid by the Company. Under the Management Agreements, the Company assumes responsibility for
the management of most
45 aspects of the Offices' business the Company does not engage in the practice of dentistry or the provision of hygiene services including personnel recruitment and training, comprehensive administrative business and marketing support and advice, and facilities, equipment, and support personnel as required to operate the practice. The Emerging Issues Task Force ''EITF'' Issue 97-2 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB covers financial reporting matters relating to the physician practice management industry, including the consolidation of professional corporation revenue and expenses, the accounting for business combinations and the treatment of stock options for dentists as employee options. The Companys accounting policies in these areas are conducted in accordance with the provisions of EITF Issue 97-2.
Net Revenue 
Net revenue from consolidated dental offices represents the ''Total dental group practice revenue'' less amounts retained by the Offices for wages paid by the professional corporations to dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants. Dentists receive compensation based upon a specified amount per hour worked or a percentage of revenue or collections attributable to their work, and a bonus based upon the operating performance of the Office.
A summary of the components of net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2008 follows

Total dental group practice revenue'' represents the revenue of the consolidated and managed Offices reported at the estimated realizable amounts from insurance companies, preferred provider and health maintenance organizations i.e., third-party payors and patients for services rendered, net of contractual and other adjustments, as defined in this report as Revenue. Dental services are billed and collected by the Company in the name of the Offices. 
Revenue under certain third-party payor agreements is subject to audit and retroactive adjustments. To management knowledge, there are no material claims, disputes or other unsettled matters that exist concerning third-party reimbursements. 
During 2006, 2007 and 2008, 114%, 122% and 128% respectively, of the Company Revenue was derived from capitated managed dental care contracts. Under these contracts, the Offices receive a fixed monthly payment for each covered plan member for a specific schedule of services regardless of the quantity or cost of services provided by the Offices. Additionally, the Offices may receive co-pays from the patient for certain services provided. Revenue from the Companys capitated managed dental care contracts is recognized as earned on a monthly basis.
Contribution From Dental Offices 
The ''Contribution from dental offices'' represents the excess of net revenue from the operations of the Offices over direct expenses associated with operating the Offices. The revenue and direct expense amounts relate exclusively to business activities associated with the Offices. The contribution from dental offices provides an indication of the level of earnings generated from the operation of the Offices to cover corporate expenses, interest expense charges and income taxes. 
Advertising and Marketing 
The costs of advertising, promotion and marketing are expensed as incurred. 46 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
For purposes of the consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include money market accounts and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable represents receivables from patients and other third-party payors for dental services provided. Such amounts are recorded net of contractual allowances and other adjustments at the time of billing. In those instances when payment is not received at the time of service, the Offices record receivables from their patients, most of who are local residents and are insured under third-party payor agreements. In addition, the Company has estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts. The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts reflects a reserve that reduces customer accounts receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible. Accounts are normally considered delinquent after 120 days. However, estimating the credit-worthiness of customers and the recoverability of customer accounts requires management to exercise considerable judgment. In estimating uncollectible amounts, management considers factors such as 
general economic and industry-specific conditions, historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance. Management continually monitors and periodically adjusts the allowances associated with these receivables. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost or fair market value at the date of acquisition, net of accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful lives of five years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining life of the leases. Depreciation was $1,544,473, $1,768,893 and $1,762,316 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. 
Intangible Assets 
The Company dental practice acquisitions involve the purchase of tangible and intangible assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of the acquired Offices. As part of the purchase price allocation, the Company allocates the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on estimated fair market values. Costs of acquisition in excess of the net estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are allocated to the Management Agreement. The Management Agreement represents the Company right to manage the Offices during the 40-year term of the agreement. The assigned value of the Management Agreement is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 25 years. Amortization was $779,294, $883,372 and $780,006 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.
The Management Agreements cannot be terminated by the related professional corporation without cause, consisting primarily of bankruptcy or material default by the Company. 
Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived and intangible assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation were required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market value or discounted cash flow value would be required. As of December 31, 2007, the Company determined that intangible assets associated with one Office should be written down approximately $104,000. This amount was determined by comparing the intangible asset and property and equipment value at the Office to an independent appraised value for that Office. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $104,000 as amortization expense in December 2007.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, are primarily cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash balances in the form of bank demand deposits and money market accounts with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy. The Company may be exposed to credit risk generally associated with healthcare and retail companies. The Company established an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and other information. The Company has no significant financial instruments with off 47 balance sheet risk of accounting loss, such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign currency hedging arrangements. Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. 
The application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. As it relates to the Company, estimates and forecasts are required to determine any impairment of assets, allowances for bad debts, deferred tax asset valuation reserves, if any, deferred revenue and employee benefit-related liabilities.
These matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. The Company also uses outside experts where appropriate. The Company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes Note 9 pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ''SFAS'' No. 109, ''Accounting for Income Taxes which requires the use of the asset and liability method of computing deferred income taxes. The objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book basis and the tax basis of the Company assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. 
Earnings Per Share 
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 128, which establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per share EPS for entities with publicly held common stock. The standard requires presentation of two categories of EPS basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue Common Stock were exercised or converted into Common Stock or resulted in the issuance of Common Stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company.

The difference between basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 relates to the effect of 189,681, 165,660 and 61,095 respectively, of dilutive shares of Common Stock from stock options and warrants which are included in total shares for the diluted calculation determined under the treasury stock method as prescribed by SFAS 128. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 options to purchase 85,500, 13,700 and 277,079 shares, respectively, of the Companys Common Stock were not included in the computation of dilutive income per share because their effect was anti-dilutive.
48 Comprehensive Income 
The FASB issued SFAS 130 Reporting Comprehensive Income in June 1997 which established standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements. In addition to net income, comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period, except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners. For 2006 net income and comprehensive income were the same. In 2007 and 2008, the Company recognized, on its balance sheet, approximately $34,000 and $9,000, respectively, of other comprehensive loss to mark down the value of the cash flow hedge net of taxes. 
Costs of Start-up Activities
Start-up costs and organization costs are expensed as they are incurred.
Segment Reporting
The Company operates in one business segment, which is to provide business services to dental practices. The Company currently provides business services to Offices in the states of Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico. All aspects of the Companys business are structured on a practice-by-practice basis. Financial analysis and operational decisions are made at the individual Office level. The Company does not evaluate performance criteria based upon geographic location, type of service offered or source of revenue.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The Company follows SFAS 123R to account for stock based compensation plans. Under SFAS 123R, the Company is required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options and similar awards based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize this cost in the income statement over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. 
The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 includes: i compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provision of SFAS 123; and ii compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of SFAS 123R. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Total stock-based compensation expense included in the Companys statement of income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 was approximately $329,000, $405,000 and $732,000, respectively. Total stock-based compensation expens
e was recorded as a component of corporate general and administrative expense. 
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used to estimate the option fair values. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are expected stock price volatility, the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate, expected dividend rate and the expected option term the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire. Expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending December 31, 2008 equal to the expected option term. Expected pre-vesting forfeitures were estimated based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures over the most recent periods ending December 31, 2008 for the expected option term. The expected option term in 2006 and 2007 was calculated using the simplified method permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin 107. The expected option term in 2008 was calculated based on historical experien
ce.
49 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS No157, to establish a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosures on fair value measurements. The Company adopted the bulletin during 2008. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS No. 159. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to elect to follow fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities in an effort to mitigate volatility in earnings without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparison between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The Company adopted SFAS No. 159 during 2008. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In December2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141R, Business Combinations SFAS No. 141R, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 SFAS No. 160. These new standards significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling interests previously referred to minority interests in consolidated financial statements. These statements are effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160.
In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active. FSP No. FAS 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 as it relates to the valuation of financial assets in a market that is not active for those financial assets. This FSP is effective immediately and includes those periods for which financial statements have not been issued. The Company currently does not have any financial assets that are valued using inactive markets, and as a result the Company is not impacted by the issuance of FSP No. FAS 157-3.
In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities FSP EITF 03-6-1. FSP EITF 03-6-1 concludes that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and must be included in the computation of basic earnings per share using the two-class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009 and is to be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. The Company does not expect the application of FSP No. EITF 03-6-1 to have a material impact on its financial position, cash flows and results of operations.
In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles SFAS 162. SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP for nongovernmental entities. SFAS 162 was issued to include the GAAP hierarchy in the accounting literature established by the FASB. SFAS 162 will be effective 60 days following the Securities and Exchange Commissions approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Presented Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Company does not expect the application of SFAS 162 will have a material impact on its financial
position, cash flows or results of operations.
In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets FSP FAS 142-3. FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142. The intent of FSP FAS 142-3 is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141R and other U.S. GAAP. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company does not expect the application of FSP FAS 142-3 will have a material impact on its financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 SFAS 161. SFAS 161 enhances required disclosures regarding
derivatives and hedging activities, including enhanced disclosures regarding
50 how: a an entity uses derivative instruments; b derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities; and c derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This statement is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. Early adoption is encouraged by the FASB. The Company does not expect the application of SFAS 161 will have a material impact on its financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

Credit Facility 
On April 22, 2008, the Company amended its Credit Facility. The Credit Facility allows the Company to borrow, on a revolving basis, an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $70 million at either, or a combination of, the lenders Base Rate or at a LIBOR rate plus a LIBOR Rate Margin, at the Companys option. The lenders Base Rate computes interest at the higher of the lenders prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half percent 05%. The LIBOR option computes interest at the LIBOR Rate as of the date such LIBOR Rate loan was made plus a LIBOR Rate Margin of 125%. A commitment fee of 025% on the average daily unused amount of the revolving loan commitment during the preceding quarter will also be assessed. The Company may prepay any Base Rate Loan at any time and any LIBOR Rate Loan upon not less than three business days prior written notice given to the lender, but the Company will be responsible for any los
s or cost incurred by the lender in liquidating or employing deposits required to fund or maintain the LIBOR Rate loan. The Credit Facility expires on May 31, 2010. The Company historically has renewed the Credit Facility and extended the term of the Credit Facility for one additional year annually in the spring and intends to continue this practice in the spring of 2009. Given the current state of the credit markets, the Company anticipates increased LIBOR and Base Rate Margins when the Credit Facility is renewed in the spring of 2009. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $44 million outstanding and $26 million available for borrowing under the revolving loan. This consisted of $12 million outstanding under the Base Rate Option and $32 million outstanding under the LIBOR Rate option. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain certain financial ratios on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in full compliance with all of its covenants under this agree
ment. 53 Term Loan 
On October 5, 2006, the Company accepted for payment, at a purchase price of $2175 per share, 212,396 shares of its Common Stock that were properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Companys dutch auction tender offer. The 212,396 shares purchased were comprised of the 175,000 shares the Company offered to purchase and 37,396 shares that were purchased pursuant to the Company right to purchase up to an additional 2% of the outstanding shares as of August 31, 2006, without extending the tender offer in accordance with applicable securities laws. These shares represented approximately 92% of the shares outstanding as of September 30, 2006. The tender offer was funded from a $46 million Term Loan. Under the Term Loan, $23 million was borrowed at a fixed interest rate of 705% and the remaining $23 million was borrowed at a floating interest rate of Libor plus 15%. The principal amount borrowed will be paid quarterly in 20 equal payments of a
pproximately $230,000 plus interest beginning December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $25 million outstanding under the Term Loan. The Term Loan matures on September 30, 2011. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in full compliance with all of its covenants under the Term Loan.
The interest rate on one-half of the principle amount of the Term Loan has been fixed with a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. The Company has elected to designate this fixed-for-floating interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge under SFAS No. 133.

Certain of the Companys office space leases are structured to include scheduled and specified rent increases over the lease term. From time to time the Company receives incentives from the landlord including tenant improvement discounts and periods of free rent. The Company has recognized the effects of these rent escalations, tenant improvement discounts and periods of free rent on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. 
Litigation
From time to time the Company is subject to litigation incidental to its business, which could include litigation as a result of the dental services provided at the Offices, although the Company does not engage in the practice of dentistry or control the practice of dentistry. The Company maintains general liability insurance for itself and provides for professional liability insurance to the dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants at the Offices. Management believes the Company is not presently a party to any material litigation.

INCOME TAXES 
The Company accounts for income taxes through recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of events, which have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. 
Income tax expense for the years ended December 31 consists of the following

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts, based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The Companys significant deferred tax assets are related to: Accruals not currently deductible, allowance for doubtful accounts and depreciation expense for tax which is less than depreciation expense for books, the tax effect of the deferred revenue adjustment and stock option timing differences between book and tax. The Company has not established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets as the Company expects to fully recover these amounts in future periods. The Companys significant deferred tax liability is the result of intangible asset amortization expense for tax being greater than the in
tangible asset amortization expense for books. Management reviews and adjusts those estimates annually based upon the most current information available. However, because the recoverability of deferred taxes is directly dependent upon the future operating results of the Company, actual recoverability of deferred taxes may differ materially from managements estimates. 
In 2006, 2007 and 2008, tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options reduced taxes payable by approximately $237,000, $955,000 and $11,000, respectively, and increased equity by the same amount.
The Company is aware of the risk that the recorded deferred tax assets may not be realizable. However, management believes that it will obtain the full benefit of the deferred tax assets on the basis of its evaluation of the Companys anticipated profitability over the period of years that the temporary differences are expected to become tax deductions. It believes that sufficient book and taxable income will be generated to realize the benefit of these tax assets. 59 Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48. FIN48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN48 requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is not met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. The application of income tax law and regulations is inherently complex and subject to change. The Company is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding the income tax exposures. Changes in these subjective assumptions and judgments can mater
ially affect amounts recognized in the Companys financial statements. 
At the adoption date of January1, 2007 and at December 31, 2008, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized, and as of December 31, 2008, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
On initial application, FIN 48 was applied to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open. The tax years 2005-2008 remain open to examination by taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. An Internal Revenue Service report issued in July 2006 made no changes to the Companys federal income tax return for 2004. No other federal or state examinations are ongoing or have been performed in the past three years.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
SFAS No. 107, ''Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments requires disclosure about the fair value of financial instruments. Carrying amounts for all financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities approximate estimated fair values due to the short maturity of those instruments. The fair values of the Company note payable are based on similar rates currently available to the Company. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, the Company has recognized, on its balance sheet, approximately $34,000 and $9,000 net of taxes, respectively, of other comprehensive loss to mark down the value of the Companys interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge. As required by SFAS 157, the Company calculated the value of the cash flow hedge using Level II inputs. 60 12
