U.S. Office Products. Upon the Distribution, divisional equity was reclassified
to common stock and additional paid-in capital. In cases involving assets and
liabilities not specifically identifiable to any particular business of U.S.
Office Products, only those assets and liabilities transferred to the Company
prior to the Distribution were included in the Company separate consolidated
balance sheet. The Company statement of income includes all of the related
costs of doing business including an allocation of certain general corporate
expenses of U.S. Office Products incurred prior to the Distribution Date which
were not directly related to these businesses. These allocations were based on a
variety of factors, dependent upon the nature of the costs being allocated.
Management believes these allocations were made on a reasonable basis. NOTE 3--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
DEFINITION OF FISCAL YEAR
As used in these consolidated financial statements and related notes to
consolidated financial statements, Fiscal 1999, Fiscal 1998 and Fiscal
1997 refer to the Company fiscal years ended April 24, 1999, April 25, 1998
and April 26, 1997, respectively. The Company fiscal year-end is defined as
the last Saturday in April.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made in the Fiscal 1997 and Fiscal
1998 financial statements to conform to the Fiscal 1999 presentation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers temporary cash investments with original
maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable.
Receivables arising from sales to customers are not collateralized and, as a
result, management continually monitors the financial condition of its customers
to reduce the risk of loss. The Company five largest customers accounted for
143% and 114% of the Company revenues for Fiscal 1999 and Fiscal 1998,
respectively. The Company single largest customer accounted for 45% and 44%
of revenues for Fiscal 1999 and Fiscal 1998, respectively.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost
determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis and consist primarily of
products held for sale. Inventory manufactured by the Company includes the cost
of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Additions and improvements
are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation
of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives
range from 25 to 40 years for buildings and their components and 3 to 15 years
for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Property and equipment leased under
capital leases is being amortized over the lesser of its useful life or its
lease terms. Gains and losses on the disposition of property and equipment are
computed based upon the difference between the sales proceeds received and the
net book value of the fixed asset at the date of the disposal.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, which represents the
excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations
accounted for under the purchase method, and non-compete agreements. Management
periodically evaluates the recoverability of goodwill, which would be adjusted
for a permanent decline in value, if any, using a methodology prescribed in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of. The Company also assesses long-lived assets and the related intangible
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these
assets is evaluated by comparing the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows
of the operation to which the assets relate to their net book value, including
associated intangible assets, of such operation. If the operation is determined
to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible
assets are written down first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the
operation, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash
flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Based upon
its most recent assessment, the Company does not believe an impairment of
long-lived assets exists at April 24, 1999.
Substantially all goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over
an estimated useful life of 40 years. Intangible assets associated with
non-compete agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the agreements which are generally one to five years.
Other intangibles primarily consist of customer lists which are amortized over
the estimated useful lives of the agreements which are generally one to five
years.
Purchase price allocations for certain acquisitions have not been
finalized. Therefore, the amount of goodwill could be adjusted within one year
of the purchase.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA EARN-OUT AGREEMENTS
Several of the acquisition agreements for the Company Fiscal 1999
business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
include earn-out provisions that could result in additional purchase
consideration payable in the form of cash payments in subsequent periods
dependent upon specific future operating performance criteria. The Company
records additional purchase consideration under these earn-out provisions in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 16, Business
Combinations APB 16. As such, when the outcome of the contingency under the
earn-out is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt, the Company records the
expected earn-out payment as goodwill and accrues the earn-out as an accrued
liability on the Company balance sheet. The goodwill generated under earn-out
agreements is prospectively amortized on a straight-line basis over the
remaining estimated useful life of the goodwill associated with the respective
business combination.
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The financial statements include the results of the Company Canadian
operations which are translated from Canadian dollars, their functional
currency, into U.S. dollars. Balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are
translated using the year-end exchange rate, and statement of income accounts
are translated using the average prevailing exchange rate during the year.
Translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Foreign currency transaction
gains and losses are recorded in income when realized.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments including
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
fair value. The face amounts of the Company credit facility, subordinated debt
and other long-term debt, approximate their fair values.
INCOME TAXES
Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company began recognizing and
paying taxes as a separate legal entity. The Company provides for deferred taxes
on temporary differences arising from assets and liabilities whose bases are
different for financial reporting and state, federal and foreign income tax
purposes.
Prior to the Distribution and as a division of U.S. Office Products,
the Company did not file separate federal income tax returns but rather was
included in the federal income tax returns filed by U.S. Office Products and its
subsidiaries from the respective dates that the entities within the Company were
acquired by U.S. Office Products. Prior to the Distribution, for purposes of the
consolidated financial statements, the Company allocated share of U.S. Office
Products' income tax provision was based on the separate return method.
Certain companies acquired in pooling-of-interests transactions elected to be
taxed as subchapter S corporations and, accordingly, no federal income taxes
were recorded by those companies for periods prior to their acquisition by U.S.
Office Products.
TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS
No provision is made for U.S. income taxes on earnings of the Company
Canadian subsidiary company which the Company controls but does not include in
the consolidated federal income tax return since it is management practice and
intent to permanently reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary. Upon
distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the
Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for
foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the foreign country.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Effective the beginning of Fiscal 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No.
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS 130. SFAS 130 establishes
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components
revenues, expenses, gains, and losses in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. SFAS 130 requires the Company foreign currency
translation adjustments, which prior to adoption were reported separately in
stockholders' equity, to be included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the requirements of SFAS
130. The adoption of SFAS 130 had no impact on the Company net income or
stockholders' equity.

Revenue is recognized when title of goods passes to the buyer or upon
completion of services provided to the customer. Returns of the Company
product are not considered material.
COST OF REVENUES
Vendor rebates are recognized on an accrual basis in the period earned
and are recorded as a reduction to cost of revenues. Delivery and occupancy
costs are included in cost of revenues.
ADVERTISING COSTS
The Company expenses advertising costs when the advertisement occurs.
Advertising costs are included in the consolidated statement of income as a
component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense
for Fiscal 1999, Fiscal 1998 and Fiscal 1997 was $854, $899 and $1,410,
respectively.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development costs are charged to operations in the year
incurred. Research and development costs are included in the consolidated
statement of income as a component of selling, general and administrative
expenses.
INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE
Internal costs related to internally developed software such as
internal salaries and supplies are expensed as incurred as a component of
selling, general and administrative expenses. External costs related to
internally developed software, such as outside programmers and consultants, are
capitalized and expensed over the expected useful life of the software, normally
three to five years.
RESTRUCTURING COSTS
The Company records the costs of consolidating existing Company
facilities into acquired operations, including the external costs and
liabilities to close redundant Company facilities and severance and relocation
costs related to the Company employees in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs incurred
in Restructuring.
NON-RECURRING ACQUISITION COSTS
Non-recurring acquisition costs represent acquisition costs incurred by
the Company in business combinations accounted for under the
pooling-of-interests method. These costs include accounting, legal, and
investment banking fees, real estate and environmental assessments and
appraisals and various regulatory fees. Generally accepted accounting principles
GAAP require the Company to expense all acquisition costs both those paid
by the Company and those paid by the sellers of the acquired companies related
to business combinations accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method.
DISTRIBUTION RATIO
At the date of Distribution, U.S. Office Products distributed to its
shareholders one share of common stock of the Company for every 7 1/2 shares of
U.S. Office Products common stock held by each respective shareholder. The share
data reflected in the accompanying financial statements represents the
historical share data for U.S. Office Products for the period or as of the date
indicated, and retroactively adjusted to give effect to the one for 7 1/2

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
SFAS 133. SFAS 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments
be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value
of derivatives are to be recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of
a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. The Company
believes that, due to its limited use of derivative instruments, the adoption of
SFAS 133 will not have a significant effect on the Company results of
operations or its financial position. NOTE 4--BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On January 19, 1999, the Company issued $4,878 in subordinated
unsecured notes with attached warrants the Subordinated Notes to certain
members of the Company management. The Company used the proceeds from the
Subordinated Notes to repurchase and retire Company Common Stock. The
Subordinated Notes mature on January 18, 2009, and have a stated coupon of 12%
payable semi-annually in arrears. The attached warrants are exercisable into
shares of Company Common Stock at a nominal cost and will be issued on each
anniversary of the purchase of the Subordinated Notes at an amount sufficient to
provide a 15% total annual return to each holder. Upon the payment in full of
the Subordinated Notes, or upon a change of control of the Company as defined
in the Subordinated Notes, the warrants previously issued to the note holders
will be returned to the Company and reissued in an amount which would provide
for at least a 15%, but not more than an 18%, total annual return to each note
holder. The indebtedness evidenced by the Subordinated Notes is subordinate to
all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. In addition to payment and
other customary default provisions, the Company would be in default under the
terms of the Subordinated Notes if more than $5,000 of the Company debt under
the Credit Facility was accelerated. Any such acceleration could occur if the
Company defaulted under the terms of the Credit Facility. Based upon an analysis
performed by Wachovia Bank, N.A., an independent lending institution acting as a
financial advisor to the Company, Workflow Management believes that the terms
and conditions of the Subordinated Notes were no less favorable than the terms
and conditions that would have been available in an arm-length transaction
with unaffiliated third parties. Interest expense for Fiscal 1999 relating to
the Subordinated Notes was $193. At April 24, 1999, no warrants had been issued
on the Subordinated Notes.
PAYABLE TO U.S. OFFICE PRODUCTS
The short-term payable to U.S. Office Products was incurred by the
Company primarily as a result of U.S. Office Products repaying short-term debt
outstanding at the businesses acquired by U.S. Office Products at or soon after
the respective dates of acquisition and through the centralized cash management
system, which involves daily advances or sweeps of cash to keep the cash balance
at or near zero on a daily basis.
The long-term payable to U.S. Office Products primarily represents
payments made by U.S. Office Products on behalf of the Company and a reasonable
allocation by U.S. Office Products of certain general corporate expenses.
Interest was allocated to the Company based upon the Company average
outstanding payable balance with U.S. Office Products at U.S. Office Products
average interest rate during such period. U.S. Office Products allocated $1,319
of interest expense to the Company during Fiscal 1998. There was no significant
amount of intercompany debt outstanding during prior periods and, therefore, no
interest expense was allocated to the Company by U.S. Office Products during
such periods.
At the Distribution Date, U.S. Office Products allocated $30,000 of
debt plus the amount of any additional debt incurred after January 12, 1998 in
connection with the acquisition of entities that became subsidiaries of the
Company. The allocation included debt outstanding with third parties and the
balance represented intercompany debt payable to U.S. Office Products. The debt
payable to U.S. Office Products was repaid upon the completion of the
Distribution with funds available under the Credit Facility. NOTE 11--INCOME TAXES

DISTRIBUTION
On June 9, 1998, the Company, U.S. Office Products and the three other
companies spun-off from U.S. Office Products as part of the Strategic
Restructuring Plan collectively the other Spin-Off Companies entered into a
Distribution Agreement, a Tax Allocation Agreement, and an Employee Benefits
Agreement, and the Company and the other Spin-Off Companies entered into a Tax
Indemnification Agreement. These agreements provide, among other things, for
U.S. Office Products and the Company to indemnify each other from tax and other
liabilities relating to their respective businesses prior to and following the
Distribution. Certain of the obligations of the Company and the other Spin-Off
Companies to indemnify U.S. Office Products are joint and several. Therefore, if
one of the other Spin-Off Companies fails to satisfy its indemnification
obligations to U.S. Office Products when such a loss occurs, the Company may be
required to reimburse U.S. Office Products for all or a portion of the losses
that otherwise would have been allocated to other Spin-Off Companies. In
addition, the agreements allocate liabilities, including general corporate and
securities liabilities of U.S. Office Products not specifically related to the
Company business, between U.S. Office Products, the Company, and the other
Spin-Off Companies.
LITIGATION
Under the terms of the agreement entered into between the Company and
U.S. Office Products in connection with the Strategic Restructuring Plan the
Distribution Agreement, the Company is obligated, subject to a maximum
obligation of $175 million, to indemnify U.S. Office Products for certain
liabilities incurred by U.S. Office Products prior to the Distribution,
including liabilities under federal securities laws the Indemnification
Obligation. This Indemnification Obligation is reduced by any insurance
proceeds actually recovered in respect of the Indemnification Obligation and is
shared on a pro rata basis with the other three divisions of U.S. Office
Products which were spun-off from U.S. Office Products in connection with the
Strategic Restructuring Plan.                  F-18             WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA     U.S. Office Products has been named a defendant in various class action
lawsuits. These lawsuits generally allege violations of federal securities laws
by U.S. Office Products and other named defendants during the months preceding
the Strategic Restructuring Plan. The Company has not received any notice or
claim from U.S. Office Products alleging that these lawsuits are within the
scope of the Indemnification Obligation, but the Company believes that certain
liabilities and costs associated with these lawsuits up to a maximum of $175
million are likely to be subject to the Company Indemnification Obligation.
Nevertheless, the Company does not presently anticipate that the Indemnification
Obligation will have a material adverse effect on the Company. Thus, due to the
preliminary nature of this action, it is not possible at this time to assess the
outcome of the claims. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for
Contingencies, no provision has been recorded in the accompanying financial
statements.
The Company is, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the
normal course of its business. Management believes that none of this litigation
will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.
POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Company has entered into employment agreements with several
employees that would result in payments to these employees upon a change of
control or certain other events. No amounts have been accrued at April 24, 1999
related to these agreements, as no change of control has occurred. NOTE 14--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
401K RETIREMENT PLAN
Effective January 24, 1997, the Company implemented the U.S. Office
Products 401k Retirement Plan. Effective upon the Distribution, the Company
adopted its own 401k Retirement Plan the 401k Plan which allows employee
contributions in accordance with Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code.
The Company may match a portion of employee contributions and all full-time
employees are eligible to participate in the 401k Plan after six months of
service. For Fiscal 1999, expense associated with the 401k Plan was $389.
Certain subsidiaries of the Company have, or had prior to
implementation of the 401k Plan, qualified defined contribution benefit plans,
which allow for voluntary pre-tax contributions by the employees. The
subsidiaries paid all general and administrative expenses of the plans and in
some cases made matching contributions on behalf of the employees. For Fiscal
1999, Fiscal 1998 and Fiscal 1997, the subsidiaries incurred expenses totaling
$181, $136 and $481, respectively, related to these plans.                  F-19            WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.

EARNINGS PER SHARE
In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share
SFAS 128. SFAS 128 establishes standards for computing and presenting
earnings per share EPS. SFAS 128 requires dual presentation of basic and
diluted EPS on the face of the consolidated statement of income. Basic EPS
excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock. The following information presents the Company computations
of basic and diluted EPS for the periods presented in the consolidated statement
of income.

RETIREMENT OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK
In August 1998, the Company board of directors approved a stock
repurchase program plan the Stock Repurchase Program whereby the Company
management is authorized to repurchase and retire up to $15,000 of Company
Common Stock. Under the program, Company Common Stock is bought by the Company
at prevailing market prices at the time of the repurchase. During Fiscal 1999, a
total of 2,066,259 shares of Company Common Stock had been purchased and retired
at a cost of $12,638.                  F-20             WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, INC.

Products contributed $6,295, $2,544 and $20,064 of capital to the Company,

$30,000 of debt plus the amount of any additional debt incurred after January
12, 1998 in connection with the acquisition of entities that will become
subsidiaries of the Company.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS
Prior to the Distribution, certain employees of the Company
participated in the U.S. Office Products 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan USOP
Plan covering employees of U.S. Office Products. Upon the Distribution, the
Company replaced the options to purchase shares of U.S. Office Products common
stock held by its employees with options to purchase shares of common stock of
the Company. In order to keep the Company employees that were option holders in
the USOP Plan in the same economic position immediately before and after the
Distribution, the number of U.S. Office Products' options held by Company
personnel was multiplied by 1556 and the exercise price of those options was
divided by 1556 for purposes of the replacement options. The vesting provisions
and option period of the original grants were not changed. All option data
reflected below has been retroactively restated to reflect the effects of the
Distribution.
U.S. Office Products, as the sole stockholder of the Company prior to
the Distribution, approved the provisions of the Company 1998 Stock Incentive
Plan the Plan that permit issuance of up to 300% of the outstanding shares
of the Company common stock immediately following the Distribution, which
equals 4,387,580 shares, including the issuance of 600,000 shares of incentive
stock options as that term is defined in the Internal Revenue Code, the options
granted to Jonathan J. Ledecky, Thomas B. D'Agostino, Sr., executive officers
and non-employee directors described below. All employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries, as well as non-employee directors of the Company, are eligible for
awards under the Plan. Non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options
granted to employees generally are exercisable beginning one year from the date
of grant in cumulative yearly amounts for periods ranging from one to four years
and generally expire ten years from the date of the grant. The Company Board
of Directors adopted the Plan prior to the Distribution. As of April 24, 1999,

In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131. SFAS 131 establishes
standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about
operating segments in annual financial statements. Operating segments are
components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision makers in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Generally, SFAS
131 uses a management approach to disclose financial and descriptive segment
information and, thus, financial information is required by SFAS 131 to be
reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment
performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. SFAS 131 also
requires related disclosures about products, geographic areas and major
customers.
The Company operating segments prepare separate financial information
that is evaluated regularly by the Company Chief Financial Officer and the
Company Chief Operating Officers. Operating segments of the Company are
defined primarily by the segment operation core business function whether it
is: a the procurement and subsequent distribution of product to the customer or
b the sale of an internally manufactured product to the customer. The Company
has determined that its operating activities consist of two reportable operating
segments: the Company Integrated Business Services Division and the Company
Fulfillment Division.
The Company Integrated Business Services Division represents those
subsidiaries of the Company that procure product and distribute it to customers
through one of the Company distribution centers or directly from the product
manufacturer. The results of the Integrated Business Services Division also
include transactions with customers utilizing the Company proprietary GetSmart
inventory and distribution system. The Company Fulfillment Division represents
those subsidiaries primarily engaged in the sale of products internally
manufactured at the Company. The Fulfillment Division provides envelopes,
commercial print products, custom forms and documents, annual reports, direct
mail pieces, specialty packaging, labels and advertising specialty products to
its customers. The Fulfillment Division also provides product to the Company
Integrated Business Services Division for distribution to customers. Corporate
expenses include the costs of maintaining a corporate office. The Company does
not allocate corporate overhead, strategic restructuring plan costs or
non-recurring acquisition costs by segment in assessing performance.

NOTE 17--OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM OFFICERS
In August 1998, the Company board of directors approved a program
under which the Company would extend both secured and unsecured loans to certain
members of management for the purchase, in the open market, of Company Common
Stock by those individuals. The secured notes are full recourse promissory notes
bearing interest at 675% per annum and are collateralized by both the stock
purchased with these loan proceeds and an equal amount of pledged Company Common
Stock personally owned by those management members participating in the program.
The unsecured notes are full recourse promissory notes bearing interest at 675%
per annum. Principal and interest are payable at maturity, September 1, 1999.
The outstanding balance on the secured and unsecured notes at April 24, 1999,
totaled $1,108 and $850, respectively.
LEASE FOR COMPANY CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS
On January 8, 1999, the Company entered into a lease, with a purchase
option, for corporate office space in a building partially owned by an executive
officer of the Company. The terms and conditions of the ten-year lease are based
on the market value of the office space and, in management opinion, are
comparable to rents that would be charged to parties not affiliated with the
Company. In connection with such lease, the Company entered into an agreement
with the landlord lender, Nationsbank, N.A., and the landlord, pursuant to
which the Company agreed to purchase the building at a discount in the event the
landlord defaults on its financing arrangement with the lender.
