These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated September9, 2016expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Evolution Petroleum Corporations internal control over financial reporting.Hein AssociatesLLPHouston, TexasSeptember9, 201639REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and StockholdersEvolution Petroleum CorporationWe have audited Evolution Petroleum Corporation internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Evolution Petroleum Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that a pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; b provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and c provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Evolution Petroleum Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Evolution Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of June30, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June30, 2016 and our report dated September9, 2016expressed an unqualified opinion.Hein AssociatesLLPHouston, TexasSeptember9, 201640Evolution Petroleum Corporation and SubsidiariesConsolidated Balance SheetsJune 30, 2016June 30, 2015AssetsCurrent assetsCash and cash  tax asset105,32182,414Derivative assets, net14,132Prepaid expenses and other current assets251,749369,404Total current  and equipment, net of depreciation, depletion, and amortizationOil and natural gas propertiesfull-cost method of accounting, of which none were excluded from  property and equipment, net28,649276,756Total property and equipment, net59,999,11245,463,642Other assets365,489726,037Total  and Stockholders' EquityCurrent liabilitiesAccounts  liabilities and  liabilities, net109,974State and federal taxes payable621,850190,032Total current  term liabilitiesDeferred income  retirement  rent18,575Total  and contingencies Note18Stockholders' equityPreferred stock, par value $0001; 5,000,000 shares authorized: 85% SeriesA Cumulative Preferred Stock, 1,000,000 shares designated, 317,319 shares issued and outstanding at June30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with a total liquidation preference of $7,932,975 $2500 per share317317Common stock; par value $0001; 100,000,000 shares authorized: issued and outstanding 32,907,863 and 32,845,205 shares as of June30, 2016 and 2015,  paid-in   stockholders'  liabilities and stockholders'  accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements41Evolution Petroleum Corporation and SubsidiariesConsolidated Statements of OperationsYears Ended June 30,201620152014RevenuesCrude  gas   lift technology services207,96016,146Total  costsProduction  of artificial lift technology  depletion and  of discount on asset retirement  and administrative   operating  from  on settled derivative instruments, net3,315,123Gain loss on unsettled derivative instruments, net124,106109,974Delhi field litigation settlement28,096,500Delhi field insurance recovery related to pre-reversion event1,074,957Interest and other   before income tax  tax  income attributable to the  on preferred stock674,302674,302674,302Net income attributable to common  per common  average number of common shares  and administrative expenses for the years ended June30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1,750,209, $943,653, and $1,352,322, respectively.

We are engaged primarily in the development of oil and gas reserves within known oil and gas resources utilizing conventional and proprietary technology.Principles of Consolidation and Reporting.Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EPM and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements for the previous year include certain reclassifications that were made to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net income or stockholders' equity. As a result of the separation of our GARPartificial lift technology operations discussed in Note 8, previously reported revenues for the Delhi field and our artificial lift technology operations have been reclassified as appropriate to crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and artificial lift technology service revenues. Before the reclassification, artificial lift technology revenues included crude oil, natural gas liquids and gas revenues produced by certain of the Companys operated wells that utilized the technology, together with service revenues derived from the use of the Companys technology in third party wells. Previously reported production costs for our artificial lift technology operations have been reclassified as appropriate to oil and gas production costs and cost of artificial lift technology services.Use of Estimates.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates include reserve quantities and estimated future cash flows associated with proved reserves, which significantly impact depletion expense and potential impairments of oil and natural gas properties, income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and commitments and contingencies. We analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. While we believe that our estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates.Note2 Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesCash and Cash Equivalents.We consider all highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90days or less when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.Account Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.Accounts receivable consist of joint interest owner obligations due within 30 days of the invoice date, accrued revenues due under normal trade terms, generally requiring payment within 30 days of production, and other miscellaneous receivables. No interest is charged on past-due balances. Payments made on accounts receivable are applied to the earliest unpaid items. We establish provisions for losses on accounts receivables if it is determined that collection of all or a part of an outstanding balance is not probable. Collectibility is reviewed regularly and an allowance is established or adjusted, as necessary, using the specific identification method. As of June 30,2016and 2015, no allowance for doubtful accounts was considered necessary.Oil and Natural Gas Properties.We use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and natural gas properties. Under this method of accounting, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, including unproductive wells, are capitalized. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to property acquisition, exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and natural gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves.Oil and natural gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized. Excluded costs represent investments in unproved and unevaluated properties and include non-producing leasehold, geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs. We exclude these costs until the project is evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined. Excluded costs are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any evaluated or impaired oil and natural gas properties is transferred to capitalized costs being amortized45Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedLimitation on Capitalized Costs.Under the full-cost method of accounting, we are required, at the end of each fiscal quarter, to perform a test to determine the limit on the book value of our oil and natural gas properties the Ceiling Test. If the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, exceed the Ceiling, this excess or impairment is charged to expense and reflected as additional accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization or as a credit to oil and natural gas properties. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the Ceiling. The Ceiling is defined as the sum of: athe present value, discounted at 10 percent, and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, of 1estimated future gross revenues from proved reserves, which is computed using oil and natural gas prices determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements including hedging arrangements pursuant to SAB103, less 2estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves; plus bthe cost of properties not being amortized pursuant to Reg. S-X Rule4-10 c3ii; plus cthe lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; net of dthe related tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties. Our Ceiling Tests did not result in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties during the years ended June30, 2016, 2015or 2014.Other Property and Equipment.Other property and equipment includes leasehold improvements, data processing and telecommunications equipment, office furniture and equipment, and oilfield service equipment related to our artificial lift technology operations. These items are recorded at cost and depreciated over expected lives of the individual assets or group of assets, which range from threeto seven years. The assets are depreciated using the straight-line method, except for oilfield service equipment related to our artificial lift technology operations, which is depreciated using a method which approximates the timing and amounts of expected revenues from the contract. Realization of the carrying value of other property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets are determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset, including disposal value, if any, is less than the carrying amount of the asset. If any asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed in the period incurred.Deferred Financing Costs.  The Company capitalizes costs incurred in connection with obtaining financing. These costs are included in other assets on the Company consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the term of the related financing using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method.Asset Retirement Obligations.An asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset is recognized as a liability in the period incurred, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, our oil and natural gas properties. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depleted over the useful life of the asset. The initial recognition or subsequent revision of asset retirement cost is considered a level3 fair value measurement. The asset retirement obligation is recorded at its estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the long-lived asset. Revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment.Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, accounts payable and derivative instruments. Except for derivatives, the carrying amounts of these approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short-term instruments. The fair values of the Companys derivative assets and liabilities are based on a third-party industry-standard pricing model that uses market data obtained from third-party sources, including quoted forward prices for oil and gas, discount rates and volatility factors.Stock-based Compensation.  Estimated grant date fair value of stock-based compensation awards is determined to provide the basis for future compensation expense. Service-and performance-based Restricted Stock and Contingent Restricted Stock awards are valued using the market price of our common stock on the grant date. For market-based awards, which reflect future returns of our common stock, the fair value and expected vesting period are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the historical volatility of the Company total return compared to the historical volatilities of the other companies comprising a benchmark index. We used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine grant date fair value of our past Stock Option and Incentive Warrant awards. For service-based awards stock-based compensation equal to grant date fair value 46Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedis recognized ratably over the requisite service period as the award vests. A performance-based award vests upon attaining the award operational goal and requires that the recipient remain an employee of the Company upon vesting. Stock-based compensation expense equal to grant date fair value is recognized ratably over the expected vesting period when it is deemed probable, for accounting purposes, that the performance goal will be achieved. The expected vesting period may be deemed to be shorter than the remainder of the awards term. For a market-based award stock-based compensation expense equal to grant date fair value is recognized ratably over the expected vesting period, so long as the award holder remains an employee of the Company. Total compensation expense is independent of vesting or expiration of the awards, except for termination of service.Revenue Recognition - Oil and Gas.We recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our interests in producing wells at the time that title passes to the purchaser. As a result, we accrue revenues related to production sold for which we have not received payment.Revenue Recognition - Artificial Lift Technology.Our artificial lift technology operations have generated revenues under contractual arrangements. Under these contracts, we were required to bear part or all of the incremental installation and capital costs for the technology. We evaluated the substance of each contractual arrangement and recognized revenues over the life of the contract as the earnings process is determined to be complete. We likewise charge our costs, including both capital expenditures and operating expenses, to operating costs in a manner which either matches these costs to the timing of expected revenues, where appropriate, or charges these costs to the accounting period in which they were incurred where it is not appropriate to capitalize or defer them to match with revenues.Derivative Instruments. The Company uses derivative transactions to reduce its exposure to oil price volatility. All derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company nets its derivative instrument fair value amounts executed with the same counterparty pursuant to a ISDA master agreement, which provides for net settlement over the term of the contract and in the event of default or termination of the contract. Although the derivative instruments provide an economic hedge of the Companys exposure to commodity price volatility, because the Company elected not to meet the criteria to qualify its derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment, net gains and losses as a result of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized as gain or loss on derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the changes occur. The net cash flows resulting from the payments to and receipts from the counterparty as a result of derivative settlements are classified as cash flows from investing activities. The Company does not intend to enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization.The depreciable base for oil and natural gas properties includes the sum of all capitalized costs net of DDA, estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs not included in oil and natural gas properties, less costs excluded from amortization. The depreciable base of oil and natural gas properties is amortized using the unit-of-production method over total proved reserves. Other property, consisting of leasehold improvements, office and computer equipment, vehicles and artificial lift equipment is depreciated as described above in Other Property and Equipment.Intangible Assets - Intellectual Property.The Company has capitalized the external costs, consisting primarily of legal costs, related to securing its patents and trademarks. The costs related to patents were amortized over the remaining patent life which was less than the expected useful life of each patent. Trademarks have a perpetual life and were not amortized.Income Taxes.We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that may result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The measurement of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance based upon management assessment of available evidence if it is deemed more likely than not some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position and will record the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. The Company classifies any interest and penalties associated with income taxes as income tax expense.Earnings loss per share.Basic earnings loss per share EPS is computed by dividing earnings or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential dilutive common shares had been issued. Our potential dilutive common shares are our outstanding stock options, warrants, and contingent restricted common stock. The dilutive effect of our potential dilutive common shares is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, exercise of stock options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period or at time of issuance, if later and common shares shall be 47Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedassumed to be issued; the proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period; and the incremental shares the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.Recent Accounting Pronouncements.In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 ASU 2014-09 one year, and would allow entities the option to early adopt the new revenue standard as of the original effective date. Issued in May 2014, ASU 2014-09 provided guidance on revenue recognition on contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or on contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets. ASU 2014-09 requires that revenue recognition on contracts with customers depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For public companies, ASU 2014-09 would have been effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard provided for either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements, if any.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes as part of their simplification initiatives.The standard requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.The update is effective for public company annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to early adopt this standard the first quarter of year ended June 30, 2017 and does not believe that adoption of this update will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU2016-02,Leases ASU 2016-02, which relates to the accounting for leasing transactions.This standard requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases with lease terms of more than 12 months.In addition, this standard requires both lessees and lessors to disclose certain key information about lease transactions.This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU2016-02 will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ASU2016-09,which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments.This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including:a income tax consequences; b classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and c classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company plans to early adopt this standard during the first quarter of the year ended June 30, 2017. The adoption of this standard will result in all excess tax benefits or deficiencies being recognized as tax expense or benefit in the reporting period they occur regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. On the statement of cash flows excess tax benefits or deficiencies will be classified along with other income tax as an operating activity and cash paid by the Company when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes will continue to be classified as a financing activity. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect the impact of adoption to be material.  Note3 Delhi Field Litigation SettlementOn June 24, 2016, Evolution Petroleum Corporation, together with its subsidiaries NGS Sub Corp. and Tertiaire Resources Company collectively, Evolution, entered into a settlement agreement with Denbury Resources, Inc. and Denbury Onshore, LLC, a subsidiary of Denbury Resources Inc. together with Denbury Onshore, Denbury, to resolve all outstanding disputes and claims between the parties, including claims related to the litigation between Evolution and Denbury with respect to the Delhi field in northeastern Louisiana. The Delhi field litigation between the parties has been dismissed by the Court with prejudice. In connection with this settlement, the Company recognized a $281 millionsettlement gain consisting 48Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedof a $275 millioncash payment made by Denbury together with its conveyance to Evolution of a 239%working interest in the Mengel Sand Interval, a separate interval within the boundaries of the Delhi field which is not currently producing and for which we estimated a Level 2 fair value of $596,500. In addition, effective July 1, 2016, Denbury will be credited with an additional 02226%overriding royalty interest in the Delhi field to remedy a previous dispute regarding the interests conveyed in the original transaction between the parties.

We have incurred $215 millionon a cumulative basis for the NGL plant out of a total authorized commitment of $246 million, with a remaining balance of approximately $31 million.As described in Note 3 Delhi Field Litigation Settlement, we received a 239%working interest in the Mengel Interval currently non-producing having an estimated fair value of $596,500. On December 31, 2015, as described in Note 8 Restructuring, we transferred our residual artificial lift technology equipment to new entity not controlled by the Company. We recorded a charge of $210,392to expense most of the remaining capitalized costs of artificial lift equipment installed in the wells of a third-party customer. Under our installation contracts, we had funded the majority of the incremental equipment and installation costs in exchange for 25%of the net profits from production, as defined, for as long as the technology remains in the wells. During the year ended ended June 30, 2015, we incurred $217,733of costs related to installing our artificial lift technology on third party wells and recorded an impairment charge of $275,682reflecting the unrecovered installation costs, net of estimated salvage value. During the year ended June 30, 2014, we incurred $377,943of installation costs. Impairment charges are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense on the consolidated statement of operations.On October 24, 2014, we sold all of our remaining mineral interest and assets in the Mississippi Lime project for proceeds of $389,165and the buyer assumption of all abandonment liabilities. On December 1, 2013, we sold our producing assets and undeveloped reserves in the Lopez Field in South Texas in return for proceeds of $402,500and the buyer assumption of all abandonment liabilities. The net proceeds from these sales of our properties, including the reduction of asset retirement obligations, were recognized as a reduction of the cost of oil and gas properties.Note 7Other AssetsAs of June30, 2016and June30, 2015our other assets consisted of the following:June30, 2016June30, 2015Royalty rights108,512Less: Accumulated amortization of royalty rights6,782Investment in Well Lift Inc., at cost108,750Deferred loan costs168,972337,078Less: Accumulated amortization of deferred loan  costs538,276Less: Accumulated amortization of patent costs47,063Other assets, net$365,489$726,037During the year ended June30, 2016, our previous negotiations to obtain a new expanded secured credit facility were curtailed due to market conditions. As a result, the Company determined that $50,414of deferred legal fees related to the proposed facility were unlikely to be utilized and were charged to expense. In addition, $107,196of deferred costs incurred for title work in the Delhi field was charged to capitalized costs of oil and gas properties. Our existing unsecured credit facility expired in April 2016 and its associated deferred loan costs of $179,468had been completely amortized. Contemporaneous with that facility expiration, we entered into a secured credit facility provided by another financial institution, incurring $168,972of deferred loan costs. Total amortization of costs related to our credit facilities for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $46,374. See Note 8 Restructuring for discussion of transactions associated with the separation of our artificial lift technology operations.The company accounts for its investment in Well Lift Inc. WLI using the cost method under which any return of capital reduces cost and any dividends paid are recorded as income. This investment is considered a level 3 fair value 50Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedmeasurement and its value will be evaluated for impairment periodically and when management identifies any events or changes in circumstances that might have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.Note 8 RestructuringSeparation of GARPArtificial Lift Technology OperationsDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we conducted a strategic review of our GARPartificial lift technology operations and consummated a plan to separate and transfer these operations to a new entity controlled by the inventor of the technology, our former Senior Vice President of Operations, and certain former employees of the Company. We invested $108,750in common and preferred stock of the new entity, WLI. We own 175%of WLI and our former employees that previously had primary responsibility for our GARPoperations own the balance of the common stock. Our preferred stock is convertible at our option into common stock which would result in our ownership of 425%of WLI, based on the current capital structure of WLI. The company has no contractual exposure to losses of WLI, nor does it have any obligation or agreement to provide additional funding or support to WLI if it is needed. In connection with this transaction, threeemployees of the Company were terminated. We accrued a restructuring charge based on agreements with the employees covering salary and benefit continuation and an acceleration of vesting of equity awards in exchange for release from liabilities and other provisions including agreements not to compete. At December 31, 2015, we recorded a personnel restructuring charge of $688,205consisting of $59,339in stock-based compensation and $628,866of accrued separation and benefits expense. Our current estimate of remaining restructuring obligations as of June30, 2016is as follows:TypeofCostDecember31, 2015PaymentsAdjustments to CostJune30, 2016Salary  taxes and benefits  liability for restructuring  Restructuring ImpairmentsAlso in connection with the December 2015 separation of GARP, we and WLI entered into an agreement under which we transferred our technology assets, including our patents and trademarks, to WLI in exchange for a perpetual royalty of 5%on all future gross revenues associated with the GARPtechnology. We reduced the carrying value of these exchanged technology assets to our estimate of their expected discounted net present value, which was $108,512. This estimate was based on the recent financial results from our artificial lift technology operations and the current depressed state of the oil and gas industry and the potential upside cases were assigned relatively low probabilities for accounting purposes. This resulted in an impairment charge of $469,395. In addition, we transferred certain inventory and minor fixed assets to WLI which had no further use in our operations and were deemed to have negligible market or salvage value. This resulted in impairments of $92,901to equipment inventory and $6,932to fixed assets, respectively. These impairments total $569,228and are included in restructuring charges.Restructuring of Oil and Gas OperationsOn November1, 2013, we undertook an initiative to refocus our business that resulted in an adjustment of our workforce with less emphasis on engineering and greater emphasis on sales and marketing. In exchange for severance and non-compete agreements with the terminated employees, we recorded a restructuring charge of $1,332,186representing $376,365of stock-based compensation from the accelerated vesting of equity awards and $955,821of estimated severance compensation and benefits to be paid during the twelve months ended December31, 2014. All of the Company obligations under these agreements had been fulfilled at December 31, 2014, extinguishing the liability.

We paid cash dividends of $6,565,823, $9,833,642and $9,723,833from retained earnings to our common shareholders during the years ended June30, 2016, 2015and 2014, respectively.On May 12, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program covering up to $5 millionof the Company common stock. Since commencement in June 2015, we have repurchased 265,762shares at an average price of $605per share, for total cost of $1,609,008. This includes 202,390shares purchased during the year ended June 30, 2016, at an average price of $580, for total cost of $1,173,899. Under the program terms, shares are repurchased only on the open market and in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such shares are initially recorded as treasury stock, then subsequently canceled. The timing and amount of repurchases depends upon several factors, including financial resources and market and business conditions. There is no fixed termination date for this repurchase program, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We have not repurchased any shares since December 2015.During the year ended June 30, 2014, we issued i1,568,832shares of our common stock upon the exercise of incentive stock options ISOs, receiving cash proceeds totaling $3,252,801, and ii2,635,696of our common shares upon cashless exercises of nonqualified stock options NQSOs and incentive warrants, all being exercised on a net basis, except for 50,956of previously acquired shares owned by option holders that were swapped in payment of the exercise price. The weighted average cost of these swapped shares was $1214.In fiscal 2014, we retired 801,889shares of treasury stock acquired in previous fiscal years at a cost of $1,019,840and 186,714treasury shares acquired during fiscal 2014 from employees and directors at an average cost of $1218per share or $2,273,857. The shares acquired in 2014 were received in satisfaction of payroll tax liabilities from the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock requiring cash outlays by us and 50,956shares were received from option holders in cashless stock option exercises, using stock previously owned by the option holder.SeriesA Cumulative Perpetual Preferred StockAt June30, 2016, there were 317,319shares of the Companys 85%SeriesA Cumulative perpetual Preferred Stock outstanding. The SeriesA Cumulative Preferred Stock cannot be converted into our common stock and there are nosinking fund or redemption rights available to the holders thereof. Effective July 1, 2014, we can redeem this preferred stock at any time for the stated liquidation value of $2500per share plus accrued dividends. With respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, the SeriesA Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stockholders, but subordinate to any of our existing and future debt.Dividends on the SeriesA Cumulative Preferred Stock accrue and accumulate at a fixed rate of 85%per annum on the $2500per share liquidation preference, payable monthly at $0177083per share, as, if and when declared by our Board of Directors through its Dividend Committee. We paid dividends of $674,302to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock during each of the years ended June30, 2016, 2015, and 2014.Tax Treatment of Dividends to RecipientsBased on our current projections for the fiscal year ending June30, 2016, we expect allpreferred and common dividends for this fiscal year will be treated for tax purposes as qualified dividend income to the recipients. For the fiscal year ended June30, 2015, 100%of cash dividends on preferred stock were treated as qualified dividend income. For the same period, approximately 86%of cash dividends on common shares were treated as a return of capital to stockholders and the remainder of 14%were treated as qualified dividend income. For fiscal year ended June30, 2014, allcash dividends on preferred and common stock were treated for tax purposes as a return of capital to our  Incentive PlanUnder the terms of the Evolution Petroleum Corporation Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Plan the Plan, we have granted option awards to purchase common stock the Stock Options, restricted common stock awards Restricted Stock, contingent restricted common stock awards Contingent Restricted Stock and/or unrestricted fully vested common stock, to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company. The Plan authorizes the issuance of 6,500,000shares of common stock prior to its expiration on October 24, 2017 and 282,133shares remain available for grant as of June30, 201653Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedStock Options and Incentive Warrants No Stock Options have been granted since August 2008 and all compensation costs attributable to Stock Options have been recognized in prior periods. No Incentive Warrants have been granted since February 2006. All compensation costs attributable to these awards have been recognized in prior periods and all remaining awards were exercised in November 2013. The following summary presents information regarding outstanding Stock Options as of June30, 2016, and the changes during the period:Number of   inyearsStock Options outstanding at July1,  Options outstanding at June30,  at June30,  at June30,  upon the difference between the market price of our common stock on the last trading date of the period $547as of June30, 2016 and the Stock Option exercise price of in-the-money Stock Options.For the year ended June30, 2016, there were 50,000Stock Options exercised with an aggregate intrinsic value of $131,000. For the year ended June 30, 2015, there were 87,000Stock Options exercised, with an aggregate intrinsic value of $501,810. For the year ended June 30, 2014, there were 4,644,759Stock Options and Incentive Warrants exercised with an aggregate intrinsic value of $47,504,114.No stock options vested during the years ended June30, 2016, 2015, and 2014.Restricted Stock and Contingent Restricted StockPrior to August 28, 2014, all Restricted Stock grants contained a four-year vesting period based solely on service. Restricted Stock which vests based solely on service is valued at the fair market value on the date of grant and are amortized over the service period. In August 2014 and in December 2015, the Company awarded grants of both Restricted Stock and Contingent Restricted Stock as part of its long-term incentive plan. Such grants, which expire after fouryears if unvested, contain service-based, performance-based and market-based vesting provisions. The common shares underlying the Restricted Stock grants were issued on the date of grant, whereas the Contingent Restricted Stock are reserved from the Plan, but will be issued only upon the attainment of specified performance-based or market-based vesting provisions. Performance-based grants vest upon the attainment of earnings, revenue and other operational goals and require that the recipient remain an employee of the Company through the vesting date. The Company recognizes compensation expense for performance-based awards ratably over the expected vesting period based on the grant date fair value when it is deemed probable, for accounting purposes, that the performance criteria will be achieved. The expected vesting period may be deemed to be shorter than the four-year term. As of June30, 2016, certain performance-based awards were not considered probable of vesting for accounting purposes and no compensation expense has been recognized with regard to these awards. If these awards are later determined to be probable of vesting, cumulative compensation expense would be recorded at that time and amortization would continue over the remaining expected vesting period.Market-based awards entitle employees to vest in a fixed number of shares when the three-year trailing total return on the Companys common stock exceeds the corresponding total returns of various quartiles of companies comprising the SIG Exploration and Production Index NASDAQ EPX during defined measurement periods. The fair value and expected vesting period of these awards were determined using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the historical volatility of the Company total 54Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedreturn compared to the historical volatilities of the other companies in the index. During the fiscal year ended June30, 2016, we granted market-based awards with fair values ranging from $293to $507, all with an expected vesting period of 383years, based on the various quartiles of comparative market performance. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we granted market-based awards with fair values ranging from $426to $840and with expected vesting periods of 330years to 255years, based on the various quartiles of comparative market performance. Compensation expense for market-based awards is recognized over the expected vesting period using the straight-line method, so long as the award holder remains an employee of the Company. Total compensation expense is based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant and is independent of vesting or expiration of the awards, except for termination of service.In December 2015, one employee resigned and three others left the Company when we restructured our artificial lift technology operations. As a result 31,467restricted shares and 14,212contingent restricted shares were forfeited. Also in connection with the restructuring, at the Companys request in February 2016, certain employees agreed to voluntarily relinquish 31,307restricted performance-based shares and 15,654contingent performance-based shares in exchange for 22,016shares of service-based restricted stock subject to vesting in three annual tranches ending on August 28, 2018.Unvested Restricted Stock awards at June30, 2016consisted of the following:Award   awards89,079717Market-based awards93,254550Unvested at June30, 2016406,848$674The following table sets forth the Restricted Stock transactions for the year ended June30, 2016:Number  ValueUnamortized Compensation Expense at June 30, 2016Weighted Average Remaining Amortization Period YearsUnvested at July 1,  awards  awards granted64,752609Market-based awards  at June30,  the years ended June30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, there were 86,719, 91,306, and 277,198shares of Restricted Stock that vested with a total grant date fair value of $757,229, $766,970, and $1,796,243, respectively55Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedUnvested Contingent Restricted Stock awards at June 30, 2016 consisted of the following:Award  awards44,542$717Market-based awards46,630334Unvested at June 30, 201691,172$521The following table summarizes Contingent Restricted Stock   Compensation Expense at June 30, 2016 1Weighted Average Remaining Amortization Period YearsUnvested at July1,  awards granted32,376609Market-based awards  at June 30, 201691,172$521$107,219281 Excludes $122,268of potential future compensation expense for performance-based awards for which vesting is not considered probable at this time for accounting purposes.Stock-based Compensation ExpenseFor the years ended June30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recognized stock-based compensation expense related to Restricted Stock, Contingent Restricted Stock grants, and Stock Option grants of $1,809,548, $943,653, and $1,728,687, respectively. Included in these amounts are stock-based compensation expense of $59,339for the year ended June 30, 2016 and $376,365for the year ended June 30, 2014 that were reflected in restructuring charges56Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedNote13 Supplemental Disclosure of Cash Flow InformationOur supplemental disclosures of cash flow information for the years ended June 30,2016, 2015, and 2014are as follows:June 30,201620152014Income taxes  tax  transactions:Increase decrease in accrued purchases of property and  loan costs charged to oil and gas property costs107,196Oil and natural gas property costs attributable to the recognition of asset retirement  working interest acquired in Delhi Field litigation settlement596,500Royalty rights acquired through non-monetary exchange of patent and trademark assets108,512Previously acquired Company shares swapped by holders to pay stock option exercise price$76,500$$618,606Accrued purchases of treasury stock170,283170,283Note14 Income TaxesWe filea consolidated federal income tax return in the United States and various combined and separate filings in several state and local jurisdictions.There were nounrecognized tax benefits nor any accrued interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended June30, 2016, 2015and 2014. We believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on the Company tax returns and that the accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. The Company tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ending June30, 2013 through June30, 2015 for federal tax purposes and for the years ended June30, 2011 through June30, 2015 for state tax purposes.The components of our income tax provision benefit are as follows:June 30, 2016June 30, 2015June 30,  current income tax  deferred income tax  following table presents the reconciliation of our income taxes calculated at the statutory federal tax rate, currently 34%, to the income tax provision in our financial statements. The effective tax rate for 2016 is less than the statutory rate primarily due to the benefit derived from statutory depletion in excess of tax basis. The effective tax rates for 2015 and 2014 exceed the statutory rate as a result of state income taxes, primarily in the state of Louisiana, with smaller adjustments related to stock-based compensation and other permanent differences. 57Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedJune 30, 2016June 30, 2015June 30, 2014Income tax provision benefit computed at the statutory federal  items:Depletion in excess of basis2,242,620State income taxes, net of federal tax  differences related to stock-based compensation155,817Other permanent  tax  income taxes primarily represent the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

The majority of the tax loss carryforwards from the reverse merger expired without being utilized. We will be able to utilize a maximum of $03 millionof these carryforwards in equal annual amounts of $39,648through 2023 and the balance is not able to be utilized based on the provisions of IRC Section 382. We have recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of our net operating loss that is limited by IRC Section382. During fiscal 2016 we utilized the remaining amount of $253 millionof net operating losses NOL created primarily from tax deductions in excess of book deductions related to the exercise of non-qualified stock options and incentive warrants in fiscal 2014. NOL related to such stock-based awards had not affected our future tax provision for financial reporting purposes, nor had it been recognized as a deferred tax asset for these future benefits. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized a tax benefit for utilization of these NOL to offset cash taxes that would otherwise have been payable as an increase in additional paid in capital, in amounts of $9,650,657, $1,633,946and $509,096respectively.In late September 2015, we received a $15 millionrefund payment of cash taxes paid to the State of Louisiana over a three-year period ended June 30, 2014. We also received $57,467from the State of Louisiana for interest on the refund and recorded it as a reduction of current income tax expense. This carryback of tax losses resulted from the exercise of stock options and incentive warrants in fiscal 2014 and, accordingly, we recognized this benefit as an increase in additional paid-in capital for financial reporting purposes. This carryback utilized approximately $191 millionof an estimated $242 millionnet loss for state tax purposes. The remaining balance of this net loss carryforward in Louisiana was utilized in the tax return for the year ended June 30, 2015.In addition, as of June 30, 2016, the Company has an estimated carryforward of percentage depletion in excess of basis of approximately $50 million. These future deductions are limited to 65%of taxable income in any period.

The plaintiffs requested monetary damages and other relief. NGS Sub Corp. divested its ownership of the property in question along with its ownership of the subsidiary in 2008 to a third party. The district court granted our exception of no right of action and dismissed certain claims against NGS Sub Corp. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended petition naming NGS Sub Corp. and the Company as defendants. NGS Sub Corp. and the Company have denied the plaintiffs claims. Various pretrial motions filed on behalf of multiple parties were recently decided by the court and discovery is in process. We will continue to vigorously defend all claims by plaintiffs and consider the likelihood of a material loss to the Company in this matter to be remote.Lease Commitments.We had a non-cancelable lease for office space that expired on July 31, 2016. Late in fiscal 2016, the Company entered into a new non-cancelable office space with a threeyear term ending on May 31, 2019. Future minimum lease commitments as of June30, 2016under these operating leases are as follows:For the fiscal year ended June  expense for the years ended June30, 2016, 2015, and 2014was $182,626, $175,103, and $174,229, respectively.Capital Expenditures.See Note 6 for discussion of capital projects in progress and expected remaining capital commitments.Note19 Concentrations of Credit RiskMajor Customers.We market all of our oil and natural gas production from the properties we operate. We do not currently market our share of crude oil production from Delhi. Although we have the right to take our working interest production at Delhi in-kind, we are currently selling our oil under the Delhi operator agreement with Plains Marketing L.P. for the delivery of our oil to a pipeline at the field. The majority of our operated gas, oil and condensate production is sold to purchasers under short-term less than 12 months contracts at market-based prices. The following table identifies customers from whom we derived 10 percent or more our net oil and natural gas revenues during the years ended June30, 2016, 2015, and 2014. The loss of our purchaser at the Delhi field or disruption to pipeline transportation from the field could adversely affect our net realized pricing and potentially our near-term production levels. The loss of any of our other purchasers would not be 61Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedexpected to have a material adverse effect on our operations.Year Ended June 30,Customer201620152014Plains MarketingL.P. includes Delhi  Crude OilLLC%%2%Flint Hills%%1%ETC Texas Pipeline,LTD.%%1%All  Receivable.Substantially all of our accounts receivable result from oil and natural gas sales to third parties in the oil and natural gas industry. Our concentration of customers in this industry may impact our overall credit risk.Cash and Cash Equivalents and Certificates of Deposit.We are subject to concentrations of credit risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents, which we attempt to minimize by maintaining our cash and cash equivalents in high quality money market funds. At times, cash balances may exceed limits federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC. Our certificates of deposit are below or at the maximum federally insured limit set by the FDIC.Note20 Retirement PlanWe have a Company sponsored 401k Retirement Plan Plan which covers all full-time employees. We currently match 100%of employees' contributions to the Plan, to a maximum of the first 6%of each participant eligible compensation, with Company contributions fully vested when made. Our matching contributions to the Plan totaled $88,348, $85,676, and $116,873for the years ended June30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.Note21 DerivativesIn early June 2015, the Company began using derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to crude oil price volatility for a substantial portion of its near-term forecasted production. The Company objectives for this program were to achieve a more predictable level of cash flows to support the Companys capital expenditure program and to provide better financial visibility for the payment of dividends on common stock. The Company uses both fixed price swap agreements and costless collars to manage its exposure to crude oil price risk. While these derivative instruments are intended to limit the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements. The Company does not intend to enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes.The Company accounts for derivatives under the provisions of ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 under which the Company records the fair value of the instruments on the balance sheet at each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognized in income. Given cost and complexity considerations, the Company did not elect to use cash flow hedge accounting provided under ASC 815. Under cash flow hedge accounting, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instruments would be deferred in other comprehensive income and not recognized in earnings until the underlying hedged item impacts earnings.These derivative instruments can result in both fair value asset and liability positions held with each counterparty. These positions are offset to a single net fair value asset or liability at the end of each reporting period. The Company nets its fair value amounts of derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty pursuant to ISDA master agreements, which provide for net settlement over the term of the contract and in the event of default or termination of the contract. The fair value derivative instruments where the Company is in a net asset position with its counterparty as of June30, 2016 totaled $14,132. Refer to Note22Fair Value Measurement for derivative asset and derivative liability balances before offsetting.The Company monitors the credit rating of its counterparties and believes it does not have significant credit risk. Accordingly, we do not currently require our counterparties to post collateral to support the net asset positions of our derivative instruments. As such, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent of nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative instruments.For the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded in the consolidated statement of operations a gain on derivative 62Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedinstruments of $3,439,229consisting of a realized gain of $3,315,123on settled derivatives and an unrealized gain of $124,106on unsettled derivatives. For the year ended June30, 2015, the Company recorded in the consolidated statement of operations a net unrealized loss on unsettled derivatives of $109,974.The following sets forth a summary of the Companys crude oil derivative positions at average NYMEX WTI prices as of June30, 2016.PeriodType of ContractVolumes in Bbls./dayWeighted Average Floor Price per Bbl.Weighted Average Ceiling Price per Bbl.Weighted Average Collar Spread per Bbl.Months of July 2016 through September 2016Costless  to June30, 2016, the Company July and August collars expired without settlement as the respective NYMEX prices for those months fell between the floor and ceiling prices.Note22 Fair Value MeasurementAccounting guidelines for measuring fair value establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.The three levels are defined as follows:Level1Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.Level2Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.Level3Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which the Company makes its own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets and liabilities.Fair Value of Derivative Instruments.The following table summarize the location and amounts of the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as presented in the consolidated balance sheets as of June30, 2016.

The fair values are also compared to the values provided by the counterparty for reasonableness and are adjusted for the counterparties credit quality for derivative assets and the Companys credit quality for derivative liabilities. To date, adjustments for credit quality have not had a material impact on the fair values63Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedNote23 Supplemental Disclosures about Oil and Natural Gas Producing Properties unauditedCosts incurred for oil and natural gas property acquisition, exploration and development activitiesThe following table summarizes costs incurred and capitalized in oil and natural gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities. Property acquisition costs are those costs incurred to lease property, including both undeveloped leasehold and the purchase of reserves in place. Exploration costs include costs of identifying areas that may warrant examination and examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects containing oil and natural gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells, geological and geophysical costs and carrying costs on undeveloped properties. Development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves, including the cost of drilling. Exploration and development costs also include amounts incurred due to the recognition of asset retirement obligations of $140,151, $576,039and $66,976during the years ended June30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.For the Years Ended June 30,201620152014Oil and Natural Gas ActivitiesProperty acquisition costs:Proved property Unproved property a596,50047,344Exploration costs757,423Development  costs incurred for oil and natural gas   As described in Note 3 Delhi Field Litigation Settlement, we received a 239%working interest in the non-producing Mengel Interval with an estimated fair value of $596,500. This cost is included in properties subject to amortization.Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas ReservesThe following estimates of the net proved oil and natural gas reserves of our oil and gas properties located entirely within the United States of America are based on evaluations prepared by third-party reservoir engineers. Reserve volumes and values were determined under the method prescribed by the SEC for our fiscal years ended June30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, which requires the application of the previous 12 monthsunweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price, and current costs held constant throughout the projected reserve life, when estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce.Proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed oil and natural gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. There are uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, projecting future production rates, and timing of development expenditures. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered64Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedEstimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves for each of the periods indicated were as follows:Crude OilBblsNatural GasLiquidsBblsNatural GasMcfBOEProved developed and undeveloped reserves:June 30,  of previous estimates  recovery, extensions and  of minerals in  sales  30,  of previous estimates  recovery, extensions and discoveriesSales of minerals in placeProduction sales  30,  of previous estimates  recovery, extensions and discoveriesSales of minerals in placeProduction sales  30,  developed reserves:June 30,  30,  30,  30, 20167,168,2497,168,249Proved undeveloped reserves:June 30,  30,  30,  30,  Significant reserve revisions occurred in the Delhi field during fiscal 2014. As a result of a fluid release event in the field, 1,817,224BBLs of oil reserves were reclassified from proved to probable category based on the operator decision to defer CO2injections in certain parts of the field. There was a positive revision of 1,679,481BOE, which was comprised of 1,275,178BBLs of natural gas liquids and 2,425,821MCF of natural gas as a result of an improved design for the NGL plant in the Delhi field. The plant was expected to significantly increase recoveries of these products, particularly natural gas, which were not previously planned to be extracted from the injection volumes.b The 2,894,703negative fiscal 2015 revision for natural gas primarily reflects a 2,246,524MCF negative revision for the Delhi field NGL plant together with a 452,786MCF negative revision at the Giddings Field for a well that was lost due to mechanical issues. The NGL plant revision resulted from a decision during the current fiscal year to use the methane production internally to reduce field operating costs rather than selling it into the market. The 156,195BBL positive natural gas liquids revision primarily reflects 185,499BBL positive revision for better recovery from the redesigned NGL plant, partly offset by a 29,304BBL negative revision due to the lost Giddings well65Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedc The negative revision results primarily from the removal of proved undeveloped reserves in the far eastern part of the Delhi field, referred to as Test Site 6, which were deemed uneconomic under the lower SEC price case utilized at the end of the period. Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash FlowsFuture oil and natural gas sales and production and development costs have been estimated using prices and costs in effect at the end of the years indicated, as required by ASC 932, Extractive Activities - Oil and GasASC 932. ASC 932 requires that net cash flow amounts be discounted at 10%. Future production and development costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate period-end statutory tax rates to the future pretax net cash flow relating to our proved oil and natural gas reserves, less the tax basis of the related properties. The future income tax expenses do not give effect to tax credits, allowances, or the impact of general and administrative costs of ongoing operations relating to the Company proved oil and natural gas reserves. Changes in the demand for oil and natural gas, inflation, and other factors make such estimates inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revision. The table below should not be construed to be an estimate of the current market value of our proved reserves.The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and natural gas reserves as of June30, 2016, 2015, and 2014are as follows:For the Years Ended June 30,201620152014Future cash  production costs and severance  development  income tax  net cash  annual discount for estimated timing of cash  measure of discounted future net cash  cash inflows represent expected revenues from production of period-end quantities of proved reserves based on the previous 12 monthsunweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for each year and reflect adjustments for lease quality, transportation fees, energy content and regional price differentials.Year Ended June  prices used in determining future cash  were nonatural gas reserves in 2016. The NGL prices utilized for future cash inflows were based on historical prices received, where available. For the Delhi NGL plant, we utilized historical prices for the expected mix and net pricing of natural gas liquid products projected to be produced by the plant. A summary of the changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows applicable to proved crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas reserves is as follows:66Table of ContentsEVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedFor the Years Ended June 30,201620152014Balance, beginning of  changes in sales prices and production costs related to future  in estimated future development  of oil and gas produced during the period, net of production  change due to extensions, discoveries, and improved recovery775,574Net change due to revisions in quantity  change due to sales of minerals in place3,150,277Development costs incurred during the  of  change in discounted income  changes in timing of production and other  end of  Due to the June 2013 fluid release event in the Delhi field, the operator expressed plans to produce the Delhi field at lower production rates.
