ProsoftTraining.com
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
ProsoftTraining.com and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2001. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
ProsoftTraining.com and subsidiaries at July 31, 2001 and 2000 and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited Schedule II of ProsoftTraining.com for each of the
three years in the period ended July 31, 2001. In our opinion, this schedule
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information required to be set
forth therein.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Business
ProsoftTraining.com is a provider of information technology IT skills
content, training and certification. We sell and license our courseware,
instruction services and Internet skills certification, Certified Internet
Webmaster, or CIW, to training companies, internal corporate training
departments and academic institutions around the world. Our products allow
individuals to develop, upgrade and certify their IT skills.
Consolidation
The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries ComputerPREP, ProsoftTraining Europe Limited and Prosoft
Training Hong Kong Limited. Intercompany transactions and balances are
eliminated in consolidation.
Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of foreign functional currency financial statements
are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the
close of the period. Income statement amounts are translated at the average
exchange rates during the period. The Company accumulates translation
adjustments as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist
primarily of accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to accounts
receivable is generally not concentrated due to the number of customers
comprising the Company customer base and their geographic dispersion. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an
allowance for potential credit losses.
Financial Instruments
The fair value of the Company financial instruments, consisting of cash
and cash equivalents and accounts receivable approximate their carrying values.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred. Advertising
expenses were $107, $104, and $91 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, generally two to seven years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the improvement.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share data  Goodwill and License Agreements
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible
net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases.
License agreements are those rights acquired from others through business
combinations to produce and distribute courseware and other publications.
Goodwill and license agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
period of seven to twenty years, subject to impairment based on the carrying
value exceeding fair value.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, including
goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount may not be fully recoverable. If the total of the expected future
undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss
is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the
asset fair value.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenue from three primary sources, services, courseware
and certification. Services revenue includes training and consulting services
and is recognized when the services are provided. Courseware revenue is derived
from the sale of books or licensing of our training materials for reproduction
or repurposing, or under OEM arrangements. Courseware revenue is recognized
when the products are shipped. Certification revenue includes testing fees from
administration of our certification tests and annual fees received from CIW
Authorized Training Providers CIW ATP. Testing fees are recognized when the
tests are administered and CIW ATP fees are recognized when the contract is
signed or, if the Company has an obligation for continuing involvement with the
CIW ATP, revenue is recognized over that period of the obligation.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees using the
intrinsic value method. Under this method, compensation cost for stock-based
compensation to employees is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of
the stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the
stock and is amortized over the related vesting period, or immediately if no
further vesting criteria exists.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the
period reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Income Loss Per Share
The Company uses the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during each period to compute basic income loss per common share. Diluted
income loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have
been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. In years
2001 and 1999, all potential common shares were anti-dilutive.

In thousands, except share data  Recent Account Pronouncements
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board approved for issuance
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 SFAS 141, Business
Combinations. This standard eliminates the pooling method of accounting for
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. In addition, SFAS 141
addresses the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill acquired in a
business combination. This portion of SFAS 141 is effective for business
combinations completed after June 30, 2001. The Company does not expect SFAS
141 to have a material effect on the Company financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board approved for issuance
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 SFAS 142, Goodwill and
Intangible Assets, which clarifies the accounting for impairments to purchased
goodwill and intangible assets. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinitive lives will no longer be amortized, but will be tested for
impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator. SFAS 142
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with early
adoption permitted for companies with fiscal years beginning after March 15,
2001, if their first quarter financial statements have not previously been
issued. The Company expects that the adoption of SFAS 142 will increase annual
operating income by approximately $2,700. The Company expects to adopt SFAS 142
on August 1, 2002.
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board approved for
issuance Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 SFAS 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This standard
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets. This standard establishes a single framework, based on
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 SFAS 121, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of, for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves certain
implementation issues related to SFAS 121. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company does not expect SFAS 144
to have a material effect on the Company financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications were made to the prior years' consolidated
financial statements to conform to the urrent year presentation.
2. Restructuring Charge
During 2001, the Company recorded a $664 restructuring charge related to our
decision to disinvest in the instructor-led training business and realign our
sales structure.
During 2000, the Company recorded a $366 reversal of our 1999 restructuring
charge related to negotiated lease termination agreements on several facilities
at a cost lower than originally anticipated.

3. Acquisitions
In July 2000, the Company purchased all of the outstanding common stock of
ComputerPREP, Inc. ComputerPREP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Drake
Personnel New Zealand Limited Drake, in exchange for $15,000 and
1,142,422 shares of the Company common stock and warrants to purchase 600,000
shares of common stock. Shares and warrants issued in connection with this
purchase have been valued at $17,800. As a result of the acquisition of
ComputerPREP, which was accounted for as a purchase, goodwill of $36,000 was
recorded by the Company. In July 2001, goodwill was reduced $491 due to the
reversal of accrued contract termination costs at the date of acquisition, at a
cost lower than originally anticipated.
In December 2000, the Company acquired the assets of Mastery Point Learning
Systems MPLS in exchange for $2,643 and 164,496 shares of the Company
common stock. Shares issued in connection with this purchase have been valued
at $1,500. As a result of this acquisition, which was accounted for as a
purchase, goodwill of $4,167 was recorded by the Company.
The operating results of the acquired businesses have been included in the
consolidated statements of operations from the dates of acquisition. Pro forma
operating results, giving effect to the MPLS acquisition, are not presented
because the pro forma effect is not materially different than the Company
actual results. The following unaudited pro forma information presents summary
consolidated results of operations of the Company and ComputerPREP as if this
acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2000. These pro forma results have
been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative

5. Debt
In November 1998, the Company issued $3,200 of 13% convertible debentures.
The debentures were to mature in November 2003 and were convertible into the
Company common stock at $160 per share. In connection with the issuance of
these debentures, the Company issued detachable stock warrants. The value
assigned to the warrants of $1,124 was reflected as debt discount and was
accreted over the term of the debentures using the interest method. In January
2000, the Company exercised its right to force conversion of all unconverted
debentures of $2,490 into the Company common stock. The debentures were
converted into 1,556,250 shares of common stock. As a result of this
conversion, the convertible debenture principal and related debt discount have
been reclassified to stockholders' equity.
The Company currently has a $3,500 credit facility with a bank bearing
interest at a current rate of 12% per annum. Available borrowings are based on
a formula of eligible accounts receivable. The term of the credit facility is
for one year, and from year to year thereafter, unless terminated by the
Company or the bank. As of July 31, 2001 and 2000, there were no amounts
outstanding under this credit facility.
6. Stock Options, Warrants and Put Rights on Common Stock

the common stock issued in the acquisitions by granting put rights covering
68,728 and 152,809 shares at $6275 and $11125 per share, respectively. The
Company is obligated through these put rights to repurchase the shares for
cash. As a result, the redemption amount has been reclassified from permanent

Net deferred tax assets. $  925 $  425 $                         As a result of the significant net losses incurred in fiscal 1999 and 1998,
the Company recorded a valuation allowance to fully reserve its deferred tax
asset. However, as a result of the restructuring of its operations and the
positive operating results for fiscal year 2000, management believes it is more
likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient
income to realize the deferred tax asset as reduced by the valuation allowance.
At July 31, 2001, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards available
to offset future federal and state taxable income of approximately $62,500 and
$31,200, respectively. Such carryforwards expire principally in 2011 to 2021
and 2002 to 2006, respectively. Federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $13,200 and $6,600 were generated from the
exercise of employee stock options and any decrease

in the valuation reserve related to these carryforwards will be reflected in
the financial statements as a credit to additional paid-in capital. In 2001,
the Company recognized a tax benefit of $100 related to these carryforwards
which was recorded directly to paid-in capital. Because of the equity
transactions completed by the Company in 1996, utilization of certain net
operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax reporting purposes created
prior to those transactions will be subject to annual limitations under the
change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
