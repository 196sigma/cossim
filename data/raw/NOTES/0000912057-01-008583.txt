operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2000 and for the cumulative period from November18, 1991 date of inception through
December31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in

and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

AEROGEN, INC.      a company in the development stage      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
NOTE 1FORMATION AND BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY: 
AeroGen,Inc., formerly Fluid Propulsion Technologies,Inc. the Company, was incorporated in the state of California on November18,
1991 to develop products using a liquid aerosol generator. The Company was reincorporated in the state of Delaware to take advantage of the Delaware General Corporation Law. At the time of the
reincorporation, the Company outstanding California corporation preferred and common stock was exchanged on a one-for one-basis for Delaware corporation preferred and common
stock. The related change in par value was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital and common stock. 
The
Company is in the development stage and since inception has devoted substantially all of its efforts to developing its products, including engaging in research and development
activities with and without
partners, raising capital and recruiting personnel. The Company has incurred net losses since inception and is expected to incur substantial losses for the next several years. To date, the Company has
funded its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, payments from partners and interest income. The process of developing products will continue to require significant research and
development, clinical trials and regulatory approval. These activities, together with selling, general and administrative expenses, are expected to result in substantial operating losses for the next
several years. 
The
Company has entered into research and development agreements with certain companies to develop products and accelerate product commercialization. The Company has ongoing
agreements with PathoGenesis Corporation acquired by Chiron Corporation in 2000 and Becton, Dickinson and Company see Note3. 
NOTE 2SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:  Basis of consolidation 
In May2000, the Company acquired a subsidiary in Ireland, AeroGen Ireland Limited see Note10. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash
equivalents include money market and deposit accounts. 
45 
Available-for-sale securities 
All investments are classified as available-for-sale and therefore are carried at fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on
such securities are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity deficit. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in earnings and computed using the
specific identification cost method. 
Depreciation and amortization 
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Amortization of leasehold improvements and leased assets is provided on a straight-line basis over the life of
the related asset or the lease term, if shorter. Upon sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting
gain or loss is reflected in operations. 
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill and other intangible assets primarily consist of goodwill and acquired workforce related to the acquisition of Cerus Limited and are amortized on a
straight-line basis to operations over six and two years, respectively. Impairment of long-lived assets 
The Company accounts for long-lived assets under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No121 SFAS No121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, which requires the Company to review for impairment of long-lived assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. When such an event occurs, management determines whether there has been an
impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to the related asset carrying value. If an asset is considered impaired, the asset is written down to fair value, which is
determined based either on discounted cash flows or appraised value, depending on the nature of the asset. 
Concentration of credit risk and other risks and uncertainties 
The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in accounts with three major financial institutions in the United States and one financial institution in
Ireland. Deposits in these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. 
Carrying
amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. Based upon borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms,
the carrying value of notes payable approximates fair value. 
Products
developed by the Company may require the approval of the Food and Drug Administration FDA and/or international regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales. The 
46  Company cannot be assured that its products will receive the necessary approvals. If the Company is denied approval or if approval is delayed, this may have a material adverse impact on the Company. 
The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel,
protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, uncertainty of market acceptance of products, product liability and the need to obtain additional financing. 
One
customer accounted for 90% of accounts receivable at December31, 2000 and two customers accounted for 50% and 47% of research and development revenues during the year
ended December31, 2000, respectively. 
One
customer accounted for 100% of accounts receivable at December31, 1999 and three customers accounted for 75%, 11% and 11% of research and development revenues during the
year ended December31, 1999, respectively. 
One
customer accounted for 100% of the research and development revenues during the year ended December31, 1998. 
Research and development revenue recognition 
Research and development revenues which are earned under agreements with third parties for contract research and development activities are recorded as the
related expenses are incurred, up to contractual limits. Charges to these third parties are based upon negotiated rates for full time equivalent employees of the Company and such rates are intended to
approximate the Company anticipated costs. Payments received that are related to future performance are recorded as deferred revenues and recognized as revenues as they are earned. None of the
revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful. 
Research and development 
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Certain research and development projects are funded under agreements with third parties,
and the costs related to these activities are included in research and development expense. The charges to third parties are based upon negotiated rates for
full-time-equivalent employees of the Company, and such rates are intended to approximate the Company anticipated costs. 
Foreign currency translation 
The Company international subsidiary uses its local currency as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at
the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts at average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly to a separate component of stockholders'
equity deficit. 
Income taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for
the year in which the differences are expected 
47  to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. 
Segments 
The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No131, or SFAS131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. The Company operates in one segment, using one measurement of profitability to manage its business. As of December31, 2000 and 1999, 52% and 100%, respectively, of all
long-lived assets were maintained in the United States. For the years ended December31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, and for the cumulative period from November18, 1991 date of
inception to December31, 2000, 99%, 100%, 100% and 99%, respectively, of revenues were generated in the United States. 
Accounting for stock-based compensation 
The Company uses the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, in
accounting for its employee stock options, and presents disclosure of pro forma information required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. 
The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123 and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling,
Goods or Services which require that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date, which is typically the date of grant. The measurement of stock-based
compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest. Comprehensive income loss 
Comprehensive income loss generally represents all changes in stockholders' equity deficit except those resulting from investments or contributions by
stockholders. The Company unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation gains and losses represent the only components of comprehensive
income loss that are excluded from the Company net loss for the years ended December31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 and for the cumulative period from November18, 1991 date of inception
to December31, 2000. 
Net loss per common share 
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of vested common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed giving effect to all potential dilutive common shares, including options, warrants and convertible preferred stock. Options, warrants and
convertible preferred stock were not included in the diluted net loss per share calculations because the effect would be antidilutive. 
48  A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per common share follows: Years Ended December 31 2000

76 Recent accounting pronouncements 
In March2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No44 FIN No44 Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation of the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 APB No25. This interpretation clarifies the definition of employee for purposes
of applying APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, the accounting consequence of various
modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award, and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. FIN No44 was effective
July1, 2000, but certain conclusions cover specific events that occurred after either December15, 1998, or January12, 2000. The adoption of FIN No44 did not have a
material impact on the Company financial statements. 
In
December1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No101 SAB No101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. SAB No101 outlines the basic criteria that must be
met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies. The Company has complied with the guidance in SAB No101 for all periods presented. 
49 
In June1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133 SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No133 establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No133 requires that all
derivatives be recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position, and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of
comprehensive income, depending on the type of relationship that exists. As amended, SFAS No133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2000. The Company does not
currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities and does not believe that the implementation of SFAS No133 will have any significant impact on its financial position or
results of operations. 
NOTE3RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS: 
In March2000, the Company entered into an agreement with PathoGenesis Corporation PathoGenesis. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company and
PathoGenesis agreed to collaborate on the development and registration of a product which will combine PathoGenesis' drug TOBI tobramycin solution for inhalation with the Company
AeroDose inhaler. The Company will be reimbursed for costs incurred in developing the product in accordance with an agreed upon workplan, will manufacture inhalers at cost plus a fixed
profit margin, and will receive royalties on future product sales. In connection with the agreement, the Company issued 961,539 shares of SeriesE convertible preferred stock to PathoGenesis at

Rent
expense for 2000, 1999 and 1998 and for the period from November18, 1991 date of inception to December31, 2000 was approximately $775,900, $564,800, $488,800
and $2,247,400, respectively. 
Executive Severance Benefit Plan 
In September2000, the Board of Directors adopted the Executive Severance Benefit Plan Severance Plan, which provides the Company officers with
severance benefits upon the involuntary termination of their employment. Benefits under the plan include salary continuation, health benefits and option acceleration. 
NOTE 8CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK: 
During 2000, the Company issued preferred stock in conjunction with research and development agreements see Note3 and in conjunction with the
acquisition of Cerus Limited see Note10. Additionally, in July2000, the Company issued 7,498,223 shares of SeriesF convertible preferred stock at $225 per share for gross
proceeds of $16,871,002. Certain of these issuances resulted in charges associated with beneficial conversion features of $16,516,574, calculated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
No98-5 EITF No98-5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features. These charges are reflected as preferred stock dividends
in the Statement of Operations for the year ended December31, 2000. 
52  Concurrent with the closing of the Company initial public offering in November2000, all outstanding shares of preferred stock 39,010,653 shares were converted into
13,003,514 shares of common stock of the Company.

connection with the SeriesD preferred stock financing, completed in August1998, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to remove the redemption
provisions associated with the SeriesA, SeriesB and SeriesC convertible preferred stock. Accordingly, the cumulative accretion charges to the deficit accumulated during the
development stage were reversed. Prior to August1998, the carrying value of redeemable convertible preferred stock was increased by periodic accretions so that the carrying value would equal
the redemption amount of the preferred stock at their redemption
dates. These increases were effected through charges against the deficit accumulated during the development stage. 
NOTE 9STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY DEFICIT: 
Common stock 
Each share of common stock has the right to one vote. The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available
and when declared by the Board of Directors, subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights as to dividends. No dividends have been declared or paid
as of December31, 2000. 
The
Company issued shares of its common stock to certain employees under stock purchase agreements, some of which contain repurchase provisions in the event of termination of service
with the Company. The shares are generally released from repurchase provisions ratably over four years. Included in common stock as of December31, 2000 and 1999 are 306,972 and 306,804 shares
subject to repurchase, respectively. 
Stock Option Plans 
The Company has reserved shares of common stock for issuance under several stock incentive plans the Plans. Under the Plans, the Board of Directors may
issue incentive stock options to employees and nonstatutory stock options to employees, consultants or nonemployee directors of the Company, and stock purchase rights to employees, nonemployee
directors, or consultants. The Board of Directors has the authority to determine to whom options will be granted, the number of shares, the term and exercise price which cannot be less than fair
market value at date of grant for incentive stock options or 85% of fair market value for nonstatutory stock options. Prior to the Company initial 
53  public offering, fair market value was determined by the Board of Directors. If an employee owns stock representing more than 10% of the outstanding shares, the exercise price of each option must be
at least 110% of fair market value of the common stock. All options granted prior to December14, 2000 are immediately exercisable, generally vest over four years, and expire ten years from
date of grant.
Options granted on or after December14, 2000 generally are not immediately exercisable. Unvested option exercises are subject to repurchase upon termination of the holder service with the
Company. At December31, 2000 and 1999, 201,234 and no shares of common stock were subject to the Company repurchase rights, respectively. At
the date of the annual stockholders' meeting in 2001, and annually thereafter on the date of the annual meeting, the authorized shares will automatically be increased by a number
of shares equal to the lesser of 45% of the then outstanding shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis, 2,000,000 shares, or a lesser number of shares determined by the Board of Directors. 
In
August2000, the Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan 2000 Non-Employee Plan under which 250,000 shares
of common stock were reserved for issuance. The stockholders approved the 2000 Non-Employee Plan in November2000. Under the terms of the 2000 Non-Employee Plan, each
new non-employee director elected on, or after, the effectiveness of an initial public offering of the Company common stock, will be granted an option to purchase 15,000 shares of common
stock which vest one-third one year after the date of grant and the remainder in 24 equal monthly installments thereafter. In addition, on an annual basis, on the date of each annual stockholders'
meeting beginning in 2001, each non-employee director will be granted an option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock which vests monthly over a three year period. The exercise price of an option
will be the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and the term will be 10years.

The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No123. Since the Company became a public entity during 2000, the fair value of all
options granted after the Company initial public offering was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and contain an expected volatility factor of 70% as an assumption. The Company
previously calculated the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the minimum value method as prescribed by SFAS No123. The assumptions used are as follows: Years Ended December 31 2000

70 The
weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $368, $060 and $045, respectively. 
55  Had compensation costs been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date, consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No123, the Company pro forma net
loss and pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share under SFAS No123 would have been as follows: Years Ended December 31 2000

1998 in thousands, except per share amounts Net loss available to common stockholdersas reported 33,387 8,968 5,562 Net loss available to common stockholderspro forma 33,586 8,968 5,572 Net loss per share, basic and dilutedas reported 730 495 347 Net loss per share, basic and dilutedpro forma 734 496 348 Deferred stock-based compensation 
During 2000 and 1999, the Company issued options to certain employees under the Plans with exercise prices below what is now considered to be the deemed fair
market value of the Company common stock at the date of grant. In accordance with the requirements of APB 25, the Company recorded deferred stock-based compensation for the difference between the
exercise price of the stock options and the deemed fair market value of the Company stock at the date of grant. This deferred stock-based compensation is being amortized to expense on a straight
line basis, over the period during which the Company right to repurchase the stock lapses or the options become vested, generally four years. During the years ended December31, 2000 and
1999, the Company had recorded cumulative deferred compensation related to these options in the amounts of $5,420,102 and $331,638, net of cancellations, respectively, of which $245,375 and $8,827 had
been amortized to expense during 2000 and 1999, respectively. 
Stock-based
compensation expense related to stock options granted to non-employees is recognized, on a straight line basis, as the stock options are earned. The Company
believes that the fair value of the stock options is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the services received. The fair value of the stock options granted is calculated at each reporting
date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by SFAS No123 using the following assumptions: Years Ended December 31 2000

stock-based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of the common stock fluctuates. In connection with the grant of stock options to
non-employees, the Company recorded deferred stock-based compensation of $960,766, $336,577 and none during the years ended December31, 2000 1999 and 1998, respectively, of which
$599,172, $101,028 and none has been amortized to expense in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. 
56 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In November2000, the stockholders approved the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan authorizing the issuance of 250,000 shares of
common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to United States employees. 
At
the date of the stockholders' meeting in 2001, and annually thereafter for a period of 20years, the share reserve will automatically be increased by a number of shares
equal to the least of 10% of the then outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis, 250,000 shares, or a lesser number of shares determined by the Board of Directors. 
The
Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As of the
December31, 2000, no shares of common stock have been purchased under the Purchase Plan. 
The
Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined offering periods. The price at which stock is purchased
under the purchase plan is equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the subsequent designated purchase
dates, whichever is lower. 
Warrants 
In connection with the financing arrangements entered into by the Company in July1995 and October1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase
10,683 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 65,000 shares of SeriesC convertible preferred stock at exercise prices of $234 and $100, respectively. Due to the automatic conversion
of the convertible preferred stock in connection with the Company initial public offering and the Company one-for-three share reverse stock split, these warrants became exercisable for 21,666
shares of common stock at $300 per share. The warrants expire on June30, 2002 and October14, 2004, respectively. The fair value of these warrants, determined using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model, was not material. 
Notes receivable 
In May1994, the Company loaned $69,009 to a stockholder/employee. The note bears interest at 643% per annum and is due May2003. In
August1996, the Company loaned an additional $200,000 to this individual. The note is non-interest bearing, is due 2001 and is secured by 166,666 shares of common stock. In
July2000, the Company loaned this individual an additional $50,000. This loan bears interest at 662% per annum, is due in July2005 and is secured by the same 166,666 shares of common
stock. At December31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, $354,589 and $296,889 of principal and interest were outstanding under these notes. 
In
January1998 and December1998, the Company received full recourse notes from each of two officers of the Company in exchange for common stock. The notes bear
interest at 593% and 451%, and are due in January2002 and December2002, respectively. At December30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, $141,079 and $58,739 of principal and
interest were outstanding on these notes. The loans are secured by 450,666 and 90,000 shares of common stock, respectively. 
57 
In April2000, the Company received full recourse notes from two officers of the Company in exchange for common stock. Each note bears interest at 671% and is due in
April2004. Each loan is secured by 90,000 shares of common stock. At December31, 2000, $110,422 of principal and interest are outstanding on these notes. NOTE 10ACQUISITION: 
In May2000, the Company acquired all the voting stock of Cerus Limited Cerus, now AeroGen Ireland Limited, in exchange for 1,725,000 shares of
SeriesE convertible preferred stock valued at $337 per share and transaction costs of approximately $150,000. Cerus was a development stage company engaged in the development of pulmonary
inhalation products utilizing the Company core aerosol generator technology, under a license agreement with the Company. 
The
acquisition of Cerus has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly the results of operations of Cerus have been included in the Company
financial statements subsequent to May25, 2000. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition as determined by management. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets was allocated to goodwill. The purchase price was allocated as follows: Cash and cash equivalents 542,174 Grants receivable 105,038 Property and equipment, net 34,772 Other assets 50,895 Assumed liabilities 287,908 Acquired workforce 100,000 Acquired in-process research and development 3,500,000 Goodwill 1,917,589 Total purchase price 5,962,560 The
amortization of acquired workforce and goodwill is being computed over two and six years, respectively, on the straight-line basis. The acquired in-process
research and development represents the value of new medical and other technologies that were in various stages of development where no alternative future use was identified. Management is primarily
responsible for the valuation of the acquired in-process research and development. The fair value of the in-process research and development was based on the discounted cash
flow method. As Cerus was a development stage company, there were no historical pricing and margin assumptions to utilize and therefore estimates used were based on the expectations of management.
Management does not expect material net cash in-flows until at least 2005. The present value of these cash flows was calculated with an overall discount rate of 40%. At the date of
acquisition, the Company determined the technological feasibility of Cerus products was not established and, accordingly, wrote off the corresponding amounts to acquired in-process
research and development. Approximately $05million in research and development has been spent up to the date of the acquisition in an effort to develop the technologies to produce
commercially viable products. At the date of acquisition, the only identifiable intangible assets acquired were the technologies under development and the acquired workforce. Currently the Company
knows of no developments which would lead it to change its original assessment of the expected timing and commercial viability of these projects. 
58  The unaudited pro forma financial information, had the acquisition of Cerus occurred at the beginning of each period presented, giving effect to an acquisition adjustment for the
elimination of acquired in-process research and development is as follows: Years Ended December 31 2000

transaction been completed at the beginning of the earliest period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results. 
NOTE 11INCOME TAXES: 
At December31, 2000, the Company has approximately $400million and $236million in Federal and California net operating loss
carryforwards, respectively, which expire through the year 2015. United States Federal income tax regulations may restrict the utilization of the operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the
case of an ownership change of the Company. 
The
tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to significant portions of the net deferred tax assets are as follows: December 31 2000

Company has established a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets. 
NOTE 12EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN: 
In August1996, the Company adopted a plan the 401k Plan, which is qualified under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Eligible employees may make voluntary contributions to the 401k Plan of up to 20% of their annual compensation, not to exceed the 
59  statutory amount, and the Company may make matching contributions. As of December31, 2000, the Company has not made any matching contributions to the 401k Plan.
