ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Shareholders of
Network Appliance, Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Network
Appliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of April 30, 1999 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended April 30, 1999. Our audits also included the consolidated financial
statement schedule listed in Item 14a2. These financial statements and the
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and the
financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Network Appliance, Inc. and its
subsidiaries as of April 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30,
1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

Basis of Presentation--The consolidated financial statements include the

investments are classified as available-for-sale, and are stated at amortized
cost, which approximates fair market value. Short-term investments consist of
$5,800 and $10,800 of municipal securities as of April 30, 1999, and April 30,

Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We recognize revenue
and record estimated product return and warranty reserves upon shipment if the
collectibility of the receivable is deemed to be probable, an executed agreement
has been signed, the fee is fixed and determinable and vendor specific objective
evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered
elements of the arrangement. Service and software subscription revenues are
recognized over the terms of the related contractual periods. Service revenues
were less than 10% of net sales in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997. Software
subscription revenues were also less than 10% of net sales in fiscal 1999, 1998
and 1997.
Advertising Costs--Advertising costs are charged to operations when
incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 were approximately
$1,072, $1,000 and $100, respectively.
Software Development Costs--We capitalize eligible computer software
development costs, which include software enhancement costs, upon the
establishment of technological feasibility, which occur upon the completion of a
working model. Software development costs capitalized have not been significant.
Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Exchange Contracts--Prior to
fiscal 1999, the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries was the U.S.
dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and liabilities were translated at the
current exchange rate at the end of the year, nonmonetary assets and liabilities
were translated at historical rates and net sales and expenses were translated
at average exchange rates in effect during the period. Transaction gains and
losses, which are included in other income expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income, have not been significant.
In the first quarter of fiscal 1999, we determined that the functional
currencies of certain of our foreign subsidiaries had changed from the U.S.
dollar to the local currencies. Accordingly, for fiscal 1999, assets and
liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated in U.S. dollars at the
exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, and results of operations
for each subsidiary are translated using average rates in effect for the period
presented. Translation adjustments have been included within shareholders'
equity as part of cumulative other comprehensive loss. The effect of the change
in functional currencies did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flow.                    32
34
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which are included in the
consolidated statements of income, have not been material in any of the three
years presented. We utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge against the
short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets or
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The gains or losses on these
contracts are included in income as the exchange rates change. Management
believes that these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to
foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts are
offset by losses and gains on the underlying asset and transactions being
hedged.
Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties--The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
We are subject to certain risks, including without limitation, risks
relating to fluctuating operating results, customer and market acceptance of new
products, dependence on new products, rapid technological change, litigation,
dependence on growth in the network file server market, expansion of
international operations, product concentration, changing product mix,
competition, management of expanding operations, dependence on high-quality
components, dependence on proprietary technology, intellectual property rights,
dependence on key personnel, volatility of stock price, shares eligible for
future sale, effect of certain anti-takeover provisions, dilution and the Year
2000 Issue.
Concentration of Credit Risk--Financial instruments which potentially
subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of municipal
securities, cash accounts held at various banks and a money market fund held at
a single financial institution. We sell our products primarily to large
organizations in different industries and geographies. Credit risk is further
mitigated by our credit evaluation process and limited payment terms. We do not
require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. In
addition, we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. In entering into
forward foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise
from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
contracts. The counterparties to these contracts are major multinational
commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of counterparty
defaults.
Comprehensive Income--During fiscal 1999, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS
130, which requires an enterprise to report, by major components and as a
single total, the change in net assets during the period from nonowner sources.
Comprehensive income for the years ended April 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997 has been
disclosed within the consolidated statements of shareholders' equity and
comprehensive income. Total comprehensive income was equal to net income for the
years ended April 30, 1998 and 1997.
Net Income Per Share--Basic net income per share is computed by dividing
income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per share is computed
giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that were outstanding during the
period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental common shares
subject to repurchase and common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options.
All prior-period net income per-share amounts have been restated to reflect the
two-for-one stock split which was effective December 21, 1998 See Note 6.                    33

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets--We evaluate the impairment of
long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to
those assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards-- In June 1998, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, which defines derivatives, requires that all derivatives be carried
at fair value, and provides for hedging accounting when certain conditions are
met. This statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. On a forward-looking basis, although we have not
fully assessed the implications of this new statement, we do not believe
adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
3. COMMITMENTS
In June, July and August 1998, we executed agreements to acquire
approximately 18 acres of land in Sunnyvale, California and to develop 393,000
square feet of buildings. All of our principal activities will relocate to
Sunnyvale in phases beginning in June 1999. Our manufacturing and research and
development facilities remain located in approximately 120,000 square feet of
space in Santa Clara, California until the Sunnyvale facilities are fully
completed. The Santa Clara facilities are leased under various operating leases
with 100,000 square feet of space expiring in June 2000, and the remainder
expiring in fiscal 2003. We lease other sales offices throughout the United
States and internationally. These sales offices are also leased under operating
leases which expire through fiscal 2013. We are responsible for certain
maintenance costs, taxes and insurance under these leases.
In June 1998, we executed an agreement to acquire 59 acres of land in
Sunnyvale, California and the accompanying 127,000 square foot building. Under
terms of the agreement, we paid $5,500 of the $33,750 purchase price as a
nonrefundable deposit. In January 1999, we assigned our rights and obligations
under the agreement to a third-party entity and in exchange received back our
$5,500 deposit. We subsequently entered into an operating lease for this
property. Our lease payments will vary based on the LIBOR plus a spread. Our
lease payments are estimated to be approximately $2,860 on an annual basis over
the lease term and are included in the minimum annual lease payments schedule
below. The lease is for five years and can be renewed for two five-year periods,
subject to the approval of the third-party entity. At the expiration or
termination of the lease, we have the option to either purchase the property for
$44,000, or arrange for the sale of the property to a third party for at least
$44,000 with a contingent liability for any deficiency. If the property is not
purchased or sold as described above, we will be obligated for an additional
lease payment of approximately $36,960.
In June 1998, we signed a 25-year operating lease requiring annual lease
payments of $3,084 commencing in October 1999, for a 62-acre plot in Sunnyvale,
California and an option agreement to purchase the 62 acres of land. Under
terms of the option agreement, we paid a $4,500 nonrefundable deposit. The
option allows us to purchase the land, within a 90-day period, commencing in
December 1999 at a purchase price of $23,745.
In June 1999, the agreement referred to in the preceding paragraph was
amended to a 25 year and three month term commencing in July 1999. In June 1999,
we assigned our rights and obligations under the agreement to a third-party
entity. We subsequently entered into an operating lease for this property. Our
lease payments will vary based on the LIBOR plus a spread. Our lease payments
are estimated to be approximately $3,120 on an annual basis over the lease term.
The lease is for five years and can be renewed for two five-year periods,
subject to the approval of the third-party entity. At the expiration or
termination of the lease, we have the option to either purchase the property for
$48,000, or arrange for the sale of the property to a third party for at least
$48,000 with a contingent liability for any deficiency. If                    35
37
the property is not purchased or sold as described above, we will be obligated
for an additional lease payment of approximately $43,912.
In August 1998, we entered into an agreement to acquire 60 acres of
land in Sunnyvale, California and the accompanying 79,000 square foot building.
Under terms of the agreement, we paid $2,500 of the $16,750 purchase price as a
deposit. In May 1999, we assigned our rights and obligations under the agreement
to a third-party entity and in exchange received back our $2,500 deposit. We
subsequently entered into an operating lease for this property. Our lease
payments will vary based on the LIBOR plus a spread. Our lease payments are
estimated to be approximately $2,340 on an annual basis over the lease term. The
lease is for five years and can be renewed for two five-year periods, subject to
the approval of the third-party entity. At the expiration or termination of the
lease, we have the option to either purchase the property for $36,000, or
arrange for the sale of the property to a third party for at least $36,000 with
a contingent liability for any deficiency. If the property is not purchased or
sold as described above, we will be obligated for an additional lease payment of
approximately $32,610.
All three of the operating leases mentioned above require us to maintain
specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of April 30,
1999.
Future minimum annual lease payments as of April 30, 1999, are as
follows         YEARS ENDING APRIL 30
2000                 $ 6,737

Thereafter                  1,361
Total lease payments                   $24,583
Rent expense was $5,963, $4,278 and $1,195 for the years ended April 30,
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Rent expense under certain of our facility
leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The
difference between the amounts paid and the amounts expensed is classified as
long-term obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
The total of minimum rental payments to be received through fiscal 2000
under non-cancelable subleases is $373 as of April 30, 1999.                    36

4. ACQUISITION
On March 17, 1997, we acquired all outstanding shares and options to
purchase shares of IMC common stock by issuing 748 shares of our common stock
and options to purchase shares of our common stock. The purchase price related
to the common stock and options to purchase shares of our common stock was
$7,350. IMC was founded in 1996 to develop and commercialize Internet/ intranet
proxy caching software.
Certain key employees of IMC who continued as our employees were also
granted vested options to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount to
the market price of our common stock immediately preceding the acquisition. In
connection with the granting of discounted options to purchase our common stock,
we recorded a compensation expense of $3,150 in the fourth quarter of fiscal
1997. We also recorded a deferred income tax benefit of $1,304, primarily
related to the compensation charge.
The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the
results of operations of IMC from the date of acquisition forward have been
included in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the
acquisition, intangible assets of $8,362 were acquired, of which $7,369 was
reflected as a one-time charge to operations for the write-off of purchased
in-process research and development that had not reached technological
feasibility and, in management opinion, had no probable alternative future
use. The $10,519 combined one-time charge for purchased in-process technology
and compensation expense has been reflected in our fiscal 1997 consolidated
statement of income within operating expenses. The remaining intangible assets
of $993, consisting of existing technology and goodwill, are included in other
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized
over their estimated useful lives of five years.     In connection with the acquisition, net assets acquired were as follows                                       
Current assets                          $  21
Property and equipment, net                      46
Intangible assets, including purchased in-process technology    8,362
Current liabilities assumed                    1,079
Net assets acquired                       $ 7,350

The following unaudited pro forma information shows the results of
operations for fiscal 1997 as if the IMC acquisition had occurred at the
beginning of fiscal 1997 and at the purchase price established in March 1997.
The results are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the
acquisition actually been made at the beginning of fiscal 1997 or of future
operations of the combined companies. The pro forma results for fiscal 1997
combine our results of operations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 1997 with
the results of IMC for the period from inception May 6, 1996 through the date
of acquisition and include the $10,519 charge for purchased in-process
technology and the related compensation charge, as well as the related tax
benefits, and the straight-line amortization of intangible assets over a period
of five years.                          YEAR ENDED

In July 1998, we negotiated a $5,000 unsecured revolving credit facility
with a domestic commercial bank. Under terms of the credit facility, which
expires in July 1999, we must maintain various financial covenants. Any
borrowings under this agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus 1% or at the
lender prime lending rate, such rate determined at our discretion. In
December 1998, we drew a $2,500 letter of credit against our line of credit to
facilitate requirements associated with the acquisition of land in Sunnyvale,
California and the accompanying 79,000 square foot building.
We also have foreign exchange facilities used for hedging arrangements
with several banks that allow us to enter into foreign exchange contracts of up
to $55,000, of which $25,099 was available at April 30, 1999.
6. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Follow-on Public Offering--In March 1999, we completed a public offering
of 2,875 shares of our Common Stock and received net proceeds of $138,834.
Stock Split--On December 21, 1998, the Company effected a two-for-one
stock split of the outstanding shares of common stock. All share and per share
amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to give
effect to the stock split.
Preferred Stock--Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
5,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without
any further vote or action by the shareholders.
Stock Option Plans--We adopted the 1993 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan
the 1993 Plan in April 1993. In September 1995, we adopted the 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan the 1995 Plan. The 1995 Plan replaced the 1993 Plan, and
provides for the grant of options and the issuance of common stock under terms
substantially the same as those provided under the 1993 Plan, except that the
1995 Plan does                    38
40
not allow for the exercise of options prior to vesting. Accordingly, all options
and shares issued under the 1993 Plan were incorporated into the 1995 Plan upon
the effectiveness of our initial public offering.
Under the 1995 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to employees,
directors and consultants options to purchase shares of our common stock. The
exercise price for an incentive stock option and a nonqualified stock option
cannot be less than 100% and 85%, respectively, of the fair market value of our
common stock as determined by the Board of Directors on the date of grant.
Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first
anniversary of the vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. Options expire as determined by the Board of Directors, but not more
than ten years after the date of grant.
In April 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the Special Non-Officer
Stock Option Plan the Non-Officer Plan which provides for the grant of
options and the issuance of common stock under terms substantially the same as
those provided under the 1995 Plan, except that the Non-Officer Plan allows only
for the issuance of nonqualified options to non-officer employees.
A summary of the combined activity under our stock option plans and
agreements is as follows                                          OUTSTANDING OPTIONS

Employee Stock Purchase Plan--Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
employees are entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair
market value at certain specified dates. Of the 1,800 shares authorized to be
issued under this plan, 797 shares were available for issuance at April 30, 1999
and 273 and 402 shares were issued in fiscal 1999 and 1998, respectively, at a
weighted average price of $1121 and $421, respectively.
Pro Forma Information--As discussed in Note 2, we continue to account
for our stock-based awards using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related
interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized in the
financial statements for employee stock arrangements with the exception of $667 270 and $85 in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, which consists of the
amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the granting of
nonqualified stock options at exercise prices below market.
In fiscal 1999, we recorded $230 compensation expense for the fair value
of options granted to an independent contractor.
SFAS 123 requires the disclosure of pro forma net income and net income
per share had we adopted the fair value method as of the beginning of fiscal
1996. Under SFAS 123, the fair value of stock-awards to employees is calculated
through the use of option pricing models, even though such models were developed
to estimate the fair value of freely tradeable, fully transferable options
without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ from our stock option
awards. These models also require subjective assumptions, including future stock
price volatility and expected time to exercise, which                    40
42
greatly affect the calculated values. Our calculations were made using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions                    YEARS ENDED APRIL 30,
1999      1998      1997
Expected Life in years     307      294      290
Risk-free interest rate       5%       6%       6%
Volatility             50%      50%      50%
Expected dividend         --       --           Our calculations are based on a multiple option valuation approach and
forfeitures are recognized as they occur. If the computed fair values of the
awards issued beginning in fiscal 1996 had been amortized to expense over the
vesting period of the awards, pro forma net income loss and net income loss
per share would have been as follows                         YEARS ENDED APRIL 30,
1999      1998      1997
Net income loss            $  12,163   $  8,677   $  4,661
Net income loss per share, basic       018      013     008
Net income loss per share, diluted      016      012     007     However, the impact of outstanding non-vested stock options granted
prior to fiscal 1996 has been excluded from the pro forma calculations;
accordingly, the fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 pro forma adjustments are not
indicative of future period pro forma adjustments, when the calculation will
apply to all applicable stock options.
Deferred Stock Compensation--In May 1995, we issued stock options for
the purchase of 2,126 shares of common stock at $007 per share. We recognized
$515 of deferred compensation in May 1995 equal to the difference between the
option price as determined by the Board of Directors and $032 the deemed fair
value for financial reporting purposes for each option. We are amortizing the
deferred compensation expense ratably over the four-year period in which the
options vest.
We recorded $916 and $714 of deferred compensation in fiscal 1999 and
1998, respectively, primarily related to the grant of stock options to certain
highly compensated employees. Under terms of the 1995 Stock Option Plan, highly
compensated employees as defined by our management are eligible to contribute
between $15 to $75 in annual salary for the rights to be granted nonqualified
stock options. The discount from fair market value which is equal to the amount
of salary contributed has been recorded as deferred compensation expense. We are
amortizing the deferred compensation expense ratably over a one-year period.                    41

9. LITIGATION
The computer industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding
intellectual property rights. During fiscal 1995 a lawsuit of this nature was
filed against us and two of our shareholders the Whipsaw Litigation. During
fiscal 1997, we settled the Whipsaw litigation and recorded a pre-tax expense of
$4,300 $3,500 in payments to the plaintiffs and $800 in legal fees. In
connection with the settlement, the Whipsaw group released us from all
liabilities. We deny any wrongdoing on our part or on the part of the founder.
10.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE
The following disclosures are made in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures About Fair
Value of Financial Instruments SFAS 107, which requires the disclosure of
fair value information about both on- and off-balance sheet financial
instruments where it is practicable to estimate the value. Fair value is defined
in SFAS 107 as the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading purposes.
At April 30, 1999, we had $29,638 of outstanding foreign exchange
contracts in British Pounds and European Currency Units. These foreign exchange
contracts are adjusted to the fair value at the end of every month. There were
no foreign exchange contracts in the prior year. Unrealized gains or losses on
foreign exchange contracts were not significant at April 30, 1999. Other than
foreign exchange contracts, we have not entered into any other material
financial derivative instruments.                    44

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
reported in the balance sheets approximate their carrying value. The fair value
of short-term investments and foreign exchange contracts is based on quoted
market value.

We have established a 401k tax-deferred savings plan Savings Plan.
Employees meeting the eligibility requirements, as defined, may contribute
specified percentages of their salaries. We contributed $314, $202 and $119 for
