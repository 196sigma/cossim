On February 26, 2007, CMS sent a notice to all Medicare Advantage organizations
that certain formulas that had previously been provided by CMS for 2006
involving in the Part D risk corridor calculations were in error and needed to
be corrected. These formulas related to fixed and flexible capitated Part D
payment demonstration target amounts. The HMO was not impacted by these formula
errors however; the PSN, through Humana, provides drug coverage that includes
these types of arrangements. Since this formula error impacted 2006, we computed
the impact and recorded that amount as a decrease to our 2006 fourth quarter
revenue of approximately $12 million for the estimated amount that we will be
required to refund back to CMS through Humana.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, estimated medical claims expense related to
dates of service prior to the forth quarter exceeded the amount recorded at
September 30, 2006 by approximately $600,000. This additional amount was the
result of higher than expected utilization and settlement amounts considered in
our original estimate of medical claims incurred but not reported at the end of
the third quarter of 2006. This amount has been recorded as an increase in
direct medical expenses in the fourth quarter. In addition, we reduced the
receivable from Humana for AICDs by $620,000 to reflect the impact of ongoing
reviews of the cases in dispute.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, we made three adjustments that we deemed to
be material to the results of the quarter. One adjustment was made to record the
estimated recoveries for AICD payments totaled $22 million. A portion of the
charges which give rise to the estimated recoveries were recorded in prior
quarters. In addition, we increased our estimate of medical claims payable by
$400,000 and we also accrued $911,000 of payroll, payroll taxes and benefits,
primarily related to non-executive employee bonuses and costs associated with
the termination of an employee.                   - 46 Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
Item 2. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
a Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2006. Based on that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
b Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
the company principal executive and principal financial officers and
effected by the company board of directors, management and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and includes those policies and procedures that       o   pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company       o   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and
o   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
the company assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.
Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31,
2006, the Company internal control over financial reporting is
effective.
Management assessment of the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited
by Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm.
They have issued an attestation report on our assessment of the company
internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears below.                   - 47 c Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Metropolitan Health Networks, Inc. and Subsidiaries
We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,
that Metropolitan Health Networks, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria
established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO.
We also have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity
deficiency in assets and cash flows for the year then ended and our
report dated March 19, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.    /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP

Other than a change in the Chief Financial Officer, there were no changes

of 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company internal control over financial
reporting.
