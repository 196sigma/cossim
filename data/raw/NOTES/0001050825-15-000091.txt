Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data:MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.Management assessed the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that our system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 27, 2015.Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent registered certified public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this annual report on Form10-K, also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein38Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders ofSTEELCASE INC.GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGANWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Steelcase Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of February 27, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 27, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended February 27, 2015of the Company and our report dated April16, 2015expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule./s/Deloitte Touche LLPDELOITTE TOUCHE LLPGrand Rapids, MichiganApril 16, 201539Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders ofSTEELCASE INC.GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGANWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Steelcase Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 27, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at . These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Steelcase Inc. and subsidiaries at February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 27, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of February 27, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated April16, 2015expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting./s/Deloitte Touche LLPDELOITTE TOUCHE LLPGrand Rapids, MichiganApril 16, 201540Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOMEin millions, except per share dataYear EndedFebruary27, 2015February28, 2014February22,  of  costs benefits37528149Gross   and intangible asset impairment charges129599Restructuring costs3194198Operating income14491659593Interest  income loss140337Other income expense, net840697Income before income tax expense13701472549Income tax expense509595161Net income$861$877$388Earnings per  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements41Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEin millionsYear EndedFebruary27, 2015February28, 2014February22, 2013Net income$861$877$388Other comprehensive income loss, gross:Unrealized gain on investments0325Pension and other post-retirement liability  adjustments01Foreign currency translation  other comprehensive income loss, gross3595533Other comprehensive income loss, tax expense benefit:Unrealized loss on investments0109Pension and other post-retirement liability  adjustmentsForeign currency translation adjustmentsTotal other comprehensive income loss, tax expense benefit570517Other comprehensive income loss, net:Unrealized gain on investments0216Pension and other post-retirement liability  adjustments01Foreign currency translation  other comprehensive income loss,  income$559$927$338See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements42Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSin millions, except share dataFebruary27, 2015February28, 2014ASSETSCurrent assets:Cash and cash  investments6831195Accounts receivable, net of allowances of $146 and  income taxes464560Prepaid expenses165193Other current assets560350Total current assets85558899Property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $1,0559 and  life insurance COLI15951543Deferred income  intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $411 and $418147166Investments in unconsolidated affiliates591530Other assets362427Total  AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITYCurrent liabilities:Accounts payable$2150$2125Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt2526Accrued expenses:Employee  benefit plan obligations294261Customer deposits251160Product  current  liabilities:Long-term debt less current maturities28182844Employee benefit plan obligations15821511Other long-term liabilities727759Total long-term liabilities51275114Total  equity:Preferred stock-no par value;

Founded in 1912, we are headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.A. and employ approximately 10,700employees. We operate manufacturing and distribution center facilities in 22principal locations. We distribute products through various channels, including independent and company-owned dealers in more than 800locations throughout the world, and have led the global office furniture industry in revenue every year since 1974. We operate under the Americas and EMEA reportable segments plus an Other category. Additional information about our reportable segments is contained in Note182.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESPrinciples of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Steelcase Inc. and its subsidiaries. We consolidate entities in which we maintain a controlling interest. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We also consolidate variable interest entities when appropriate.Investments in entities where our equity ownership falls between 20%and 50%, or where we otherwise have significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. All other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. These investments are reported as Investments in unconsolidated affiliateson the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and income from equity method and cost method investments are reported in Other income expense, neton the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 11for additional information.Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on the last Friday in February, with each fiscal quarter typically including 13weeks. The fiscal years ended February27, 2015and February22, 2013contained 52weeks. The fiscal year ended February28, 2014contained 53weeks, with Q4 2014 containing 14 weeks. Reference to a year relates to the fiscal year, ended in February of the year indicated, rather than the calendar year, unless indicated by a specific date. Additionally, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 reference the first, second, third and fourth quarter, respectively, of the fiscal year indicated. All amounts are in millions, except share and per share data, data presented as a percentage or as otherwise indicated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on historical data and managements knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.Foreign CurrencyFor most international operations, local currencies are considered the functional currencies. We translate assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries to their U.S.dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income losson the Consolidated Balance Sheets until a sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place. We translate Consolidated Statements of Incomeaccounts at average exchange rates for the applicable period.Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, net of derivatives, arising primarily from changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions and balances between foreign locations, are recorded in Other income expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income46Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedCash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include demand bank deposits and highly liquid investment securities with an original maturity of three months or less. Cash equivalents are reported at cost and approximate fair value. Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit are classified as Accounts payableon the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our restricted cash balance as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014was $25and $90, respectively, and consisted primarily of funds held in escrow for potential future workers compensation claims and construction in progress in 2014. Our restricted cash balance is classified in Other assetson the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Allowances for Credit LossesAllowances for credit losses related to accounts receivable and notes receivable are maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to absorb an estimate of probable future losses existing at the balance sheet date. In estimating probable losses, we review accounts that are past due or in bankruptcy. We consider an accounts receivable or notes receivable balance past due when payment is not received within the stated terms. We review accounts that may have higher credit risk using information available about the debtor, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings. We also use general information regarding industry trends, the economic environment and information gathered through our network of field-based employees. Using an estimate of current fair market value of any applicable collateral and other credit enhancements, such as third party guarantees, we arrive at an estimated loss for specific concerns and estimate an additional amount for the remainder of trade balances based on historical trends and other factors previously referenced. Receivable balances are written off when we determine the balance is uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to bad debt expense when received.Concentrations of Credit RiskOur trade receivables are primarily due from independent dealers who, in turn, carry receivables from their customers. We monitor and manage the credit risk associated with individual dealers and direct customers where applicable. Dealers are responsible for assessing and assuming credit risk of their customers and may require their customers to provide deposits, letters of credit or other credit enhancement measures. Some sales contracts are structured such that the customer payment or obligation is direct to us. In those cases, we may assume the credit risk. Whether from dealers or customers, our trade credit exposures are not concentrated with any particular entity.InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The Americas segment primarily uses the last in, first out LIFO method to value its inventories. The EMEA segment values inventories primarily using the first in, first out method. Businesses within the Other category primarily use the first in, first out or the average cost inventory valuation methods. See Note 7for additional information.Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Major improvements that materially extend the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.Long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate several conditions, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value.When assets are classified as held for sale, losses are recorded for the difference between the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment and the estimated fair value less estimated selling costs. Assets are 47Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  held for sale when it is expected that the asset is going to be sold within twelve months. See Note8for additional information.Operating LeasesRent expense under operating leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless the lease contains an escalation clause which is not fixed and determinable. The lease term begins when we have the right to control the use of the leased property, which is typically before rent payments are due under the terms of the lease. If a lease has a fixed and determinable escalation clause, the difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent. Rent expense under operating leases that do not have an escalation clause or where escalation is based on an inflation index is expensed over the lease term as it is payable. See Note17for additional information.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions. Annually in Q4, or earlier if conditions indicate it is necessary, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, goodwill is impaired and is written down to its estimated fair value. Goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level. We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets using six reporting units: the Americas, Red Thread, EMEA, Asia Pacific, Designtex and PolyVision. See Note10for additional information.Other intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of proprietary technology, trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements and are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight-line method. Other intangible assets not subject to amortization, consisting of certain trademarks, are accounted for and evaluated for potential impairment in a manner consistent with goodwill. See Note10for additional information.ContingenciesLoss contingencies are accrued if the loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs associated with potential loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. We are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Based on known information, we do not believe we are party to any lawsuit or proceeding, individually and in the aggregate, that is likely to have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements.Self-InsuranceWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to domestic workers compensation, product liability and employee medical, dental, and short-term disability claims. We purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of these claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred as of the balance sheet date using current and historical claims experience and certain actuarial assumptions. These estimates are subject to uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including extended lag times in the reporting and resolution of claims, and trends or changes in claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations. As a result, actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts. Adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.Our total net reserve for estimated domestic workers compensation claims incurred as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014was $137and $146, respectively. Our reserve for estimated domestic workers compensation claims expected to be paid within one year as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014was $38and $50, respectively, and is included in Accrued expenses: Otheron the Consolidated Balance Sheets, while our reserve for estimated domestic workers compensation claims expected to be paid beyond one year is included in Other long-term liabilitieson the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, $45of these claims expected to be paid beyond one year recorded as of February 27, 2015is offset by a corresponding asset representing the portion of these claims expected to be paid by a third party insurance provider, which asset is included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet48Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedOur net reserve for estimated product liability claims incurred as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014was $69and $58, respectively. Our reserve for estimated product liability claims expected to be paid within one year is included in Accrued expenses: Otheron the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The portion of these claims expected to paid beyond one year is included in Other long-term liabilitieson the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, $25of these claims expected to be paid beyond one year recorded as of February 27, 2015is offset by a corresponding asset representing the portion of these claims expected to be paid by a third party insurance provider, which asset is included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.The estimate for employee medical, dental, and short-term disability claims incurred as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014was $31and $28, respectively, and is recorded within Accrued expenses: Otheron the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Product WarrantiesWe offer warranties ranging from 12 yearsto lifetimefor most products, subject to certain exceptions. These warranties provide for the free repair or replacement of any covered product, part or component that fails during normal use because of a defect in materials or workmanship. The accrued liability for product warranties is based on an estimated amount needed to cover product warranty costs, including product recall and retrofit costs incurred as of the balance sheet date determined by historical claims experience and our knowledge of current events and actions.Roll-Forward of AccruedLiability for Product WarrantiesYear EndedFebruary27, 2015February28, 2014February22, 2013Balance as of beginning of period$373$311$299Accruals related to product warranties, recalls and  related to changes in estimates4603Reductions for  translation adjustments140302Balance as of end of period$394$373$311Our reserve for estimated settlements expected to be paid beyond one year as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014was $170and $198, respectively, and is included in Other long-term liabilitieson the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Pension and Other Post-Retirement BenefitsWe sponsor a number of domestic and foreign plans to provide pension benefits and medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees. We measure the net over-funded or under-funded positions of our defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans as of the fiscal year end and display that position as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any unrecognized prior service credit cost, experience gainslosses or transition obligation is reported, net of tax, as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income lossin shareholders equity. See Note13for additional information.Environmental MattersEnvironmental expenditures related to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures related to an existing condition allegedly caused by past operations, and not associated with current or future revenue generation, are expensed. Generally, the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action. Liabilities are recorded on a discounted basis as site-specific plans indicate the amount and timing of cash payments are fixed or reliably determinable. We have ongoing monitoring and identification processes to assess how the activities, with respect to the known exposures, are progressing against the accrued cost estimates, as well as to identify other potential remediation sites that are presently unknown. The liability for environmental contingencies included in Accrued expenses: Otheron the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $56and $66as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, respectively. These liabilities were discounted using a rate of 40%and 36%as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, 49Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  Our undiscounted liabilities were $71and $85as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, respectively. Based on our ongoing evaluation of these matters, we believe we have accrued sufficient reserves to absorb the costs of all known environmental assessments and the remediation costs of all known sites.Asset Retirement ObligationsWe record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations we have not yet discovered, and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionRevenue consists substantially of product sales and related service revenue. Product sales are reported net of discounts and are recognized when title and risks associated with ownership have passed to the dealer or customer. Typically, this is when product is shipped to the dealer. When product is shipped directly to an end customer, revenue is typically recognized upon delivery or upon acceptance by the end customer. Revenue from services is recognized when the services have been rendered. Total revenue does not include sales tax, as we consider ourselves a pass-through entity for collecting and remitting sales taxes.Cost of SalesCost of sales includes material, labor and overhead.Included within these categories are such items as compensation expense, depreciation, facilities expense, inbound freight charges, warehousing costs, shipping and handling expenses, warranty expense, internal transfer costs and other costs of our distribution network.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses not directly related to the manufacturing of our products. Included in these expenses are items such as compensation expense, depreciation, facilities expense, research and development expense, rental expense, royalty expense, information technology services, legal and other professional services and travel and entertainment expense.Research and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses, which are expensed as incurred, were $385for 2015, $359for 2014and $360for 2013. Royalties are sometimes paid to external designers of our products as the products are sold. These costs are not included in research and development expenses.Income TaxesDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period that includes the enactment date.We have net operating loss carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income. Future tax benefits associated with net operating loss carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not. This determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax, business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards. In making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence. To the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset, a valuation allowance is established50Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedWe record reserves for uncertain tax positions except to the extent it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Periodic changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions are reflected in the provision for income taxes. See Note15for additional information.Share-Based CompensationOur share-based compensation consists of restricted stock units and performance units. Our policy is to expense share-based compensation using the fair-value based method of accounting for all awards granted, modified or settled.Restricted stock units and performance units are credited to equity as they are expensed over the requisite service periods based on the grant date fair value of the shares expected to be issued. See Note16for additional information.Financial InstrumentsThe carrying amounts of our financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts and notes payable and certain other liabilities, approximate their fair value due to their relatively short maturities. Our short-term investments, foreign exchange forward contracts and long-term investments are measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our total debt is carried at cost and was $2843and $2870as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, respectively. The fair value of our total debt is measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for similar types of instruments and was approximately $323and $327as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, respectively. The estimation of the fair value of our total debt is based on Level 2 fair value measurements.See Note6and Note 12for additional information.We periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The use of these financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intention to reduce our risk of short-term volatility. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.Foreign Exchange Forward ContractsA portion of our revenue and earnings is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk largely through operational means, including matching same currency revenue with same currency costs and same currency assets with same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also partially managed through the use of derivative instruments. Foreign exchange forward contracts serve to reduce the risk of conversion or translation of certain foreign denominated transactions, assets and liabilities.

The new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the revenue model is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions and also requires enhanced disclosures. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements4.EARNINGS PER SHAREEarnings per share is computed using the two-class method. The two-class method determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Participating securities represent restricted stock units in which the participants have non-forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents during the performance period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effects of certain performance units in which the participants have forfeitable rights to dividend equivalents during the performance period.Computation of Earnings per ShareYear EndedFebruary27, 2015February28, 2014February22, 2013Net  for earnings attributable to participating securities161406Net income used in calculating earnings per  common shares outstanding including participating securities in  for participating securities in  used in calculating basic earnings per share in  of dilutive stock-based compensation in millions161317Shares used in calculating diluted earnings per share in  per  common shares outstanding at period end in  performance units excluded from computation of diluted earnings per share in millions0152Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSSThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated balances of other comprehensive income loss during the years ended February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014:Unrealized gain on investmentsPension and other post-retirement liability adjustmentsDerivative adjustmentsForeign currency translation adjustmentsTotalBalance as of February 22,  comprehensive income before  reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss015758Net other comprehensive income during period02074150Balance as of February 28,  comprehensive income loss before  reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss350134Net other comprehensive income loss during  as of February 27,  following table provides details about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the years ended February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014:Detail of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss ComponentsAmount Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income LossAffected Line in the Consolidated Statements of IncomeYear EndedFebruary27, 2015February28, 2014Unrealized gains on investments$$01Other income expense, netIncome tax expense01Net incomeUnrealized gains on derivatives01Other income expense, netIncome tax expense01Net incomeAmortization of pension and other post-retirement liability adjustmentsActuarial losses1303Cost of salesActuarial losses0712Operating expensesPrior service credit4243Cost of salesPrior service credit4848Operating expenses3519Income tax expense3557Net incomeTotal  VALUE53Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedFair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:Level1 Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.Level2 Inputs based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.Level3 Inputs reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use to price the asset or liability at the measurement date in model-driven valuations. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instruments valuation.Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. A measurement may therefore be classified within Level3 even though there may be other significant inputs that are readily observable54Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedAssets and liabilities measured at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014are summarized below:Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsFebruary27, 2015Level 1Level 2Level3TotalAssets:Cash and cash  cash2525Managed investment portfolio and other investmentsCorporate debt securities307307U.S. agency debt  securities7777U.S. government debt securities4343Municipal debt securities0808Other investments0707Foreign exchange forward contracts241241Auction rate securities9797Canadian asset-backed commercial paper restructuring  exchange forward  Value of Financial InstrumentsFebruary28, 2014Level 1Level2Level3TotalAssets:Cash and cash  cash9090Managed investment portfolio and other investmentsCorporate debt securities480480U.S. agency debt  securities5656U.S. government debt securities7878Municipal debt securities3434Other investments5858Foreign exchange forward contracts0303Auction rate securities9696Canadian asset-backed commercial paper restructuring  exchange forward  of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedManaged Investment Portfolio and Other InvestmentsOur managed investment portfolio consists of corporate debt securities, U.S. agency debt securities, asset backed securities, U.S. government debt securities and municipal debt securities. Our investment manager operates under a mandate to keep the average duration of investments under two years. Our managed investment portfolio and other investments are considered available-for-sale. Fair values for these investments are based upon valuations for identical or similar instruments in active markets, with the resulting net unrealized holding gains or losses reflected net of tax as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income losson the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The cost basis for these investments, determined using the specific identification method, was $676and $1190as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, respectively. Gross unrealized gains were $01for 2015and $02for 2014. As of February 27, 2015, approximately 36%of the debt securities mature within one year, approximately 28%in two years, approximately 29%in three years and approximately 7%in four or more years.Foreign Exchange Forward ContractsFrom time to time, we enter into forward contracts to reduce the risk of translation into U.S.dollars of certain foreign-denominated transactions, assets and liabilities. We primarily hedge intercompany working capital loans and certain forecasted currency flows from foreign-denominated transactions. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is based on a valuation model that calculates the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate.Auction Rate SecuritiesAs of February 27, 2015, we held auction rate securities ARS totaling $117of par value. Historically, liquidity for these securities was provided through a Dutch auction process that reset the applicable interest rate at pre-determined short-term intervals. The auctions failed in 2008 and are not being conducted at this time. While there has been no payment default with respect to our ARS, these investments are not widely traded and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value. We receive higher penalty interest rates on the securities ranging from 30-day LIBORplus 20to 25%. We have the intent and ability to hold these securities until recovery of market value or maturity, and we believe the current inability to easily liquidate these investments will have no impact on our ability to fund our ongoing operations. To estimate fair value, we used an internally-developed discounted cash flow analysis. Our discounted cash flow analysis considers, among other factors, ithe credit ratings of the ARS, iithe credit quality of the underlying securities or the credit rating of issuers, iiithe estimated timing and amount of cash flows, ivthe formula applicable to each security which defines the penalty interest rate and v discount rates equal to the sum of athe yield on U.S.Treasury securities with a term through the estimated workout date plus ba risk premium based on similarly rated observable securities. These assumptions are based on our current judgment and our view of current market conditions. Based upon these factors, ARS with an original par value of approximately $117have been adjusted to an estimated fair value of $97as of February 27, 2015.We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. Since the auctions failed in 2008, we have recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses and unrealized gains on our ARS investments of $25and $05, respectively. The investments other-than-temporarily impaired as of February 27, 2015were impaired due to general credit declines, and the impairments were recorded in Investment income lossin the Consolidated Statements of Income. Unrealized gains are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income losson the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The unrealized gains are due to changes in interest rates and are expected to fluctuate over the contractual term of the instruments. The use of different assumptions could result in a different valuation and additional impairments. For example, an increase to the discount rate of 100basis points would reduce the estimated fair value of our investment in ARS by approximately $03.We continue to monitor the market for ARS and consider the impact, if any, on the estimated fair value of these investments. If current market conditions deteriorate further, or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, we may be required to record additional other-than-temporary impairments and/or unrealized impairment losses56Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedCanadian Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Restructuring NotesAs of February 27, 2015, we held four floating-rate Canadian asset-backed commercial paper restructuring notes with a combined par value of Canadian $44. These notes replaced an investment in Canadian asset-backed commercial paper, which, as a result of a lack of liquidity in the market, failed to settle on maturity and went into default. We recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in 2008 of $09. In 2014, these assets were transferred out of Level 3 primarily as the result of increased market liquidity and price transparency.Below is a roll-forward of assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value using Level3 inputs for the years ended February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014:Roll-forward of Fair Value Using Level 3  as of February 22, 2013$98$35Unrealized loss on investments0205Currency translation adjustment03Transfers out of Level 337Balance as of February 28, 2014$96$Unrealized gain on investments01Balance as of February 27, 2015$97There were no other-than-temporary impairments or transfers into Level 3 during either 2015or 2014.

There were nointerest costs capitalized in construction in progress in 2015, 2014 or 2013. In 2013, we recognized a $124impairment charge in conjunction with the previously announced closure of our Corporate Development Center. The decline in market value of the facility and the completion of employee relocations out of the facility led to the charge in 2013. This charge was included in Restructuring costsin the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The designations of our COLI investments as funding sources for our benefit obligations do not result in these investments representing a committed funding source for these obligations. They are subject to claims from creditors, and we can designate them to another purpose at any time. The costs associated with the long-term benefit obligations that the investments are intended to fund are recorded in Operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As these costs exceed the net returns in cash surrender value, normal insurance expenses and any death benefit gains related to our investments in COLI policies COLI income, we began recording all COLI income in Operating expenseson the Consolidated Statements of Incomeduring Q3 2014.Prior to Q3 2014, our investments in whole life COLI policies were intended to be utilized as a long-term funding source for post-retirement medical benefits, deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plan obligations, and our investments in variable life COLI policies were primarily considered a source of corporate liquidity. Additionally, during Q3 2014 we reduced the variable life COLI balances by withdrawing basis of $745tax-free and invested the cash proceeds in short-term investments. 58Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe balances of our COLI investments as of February27, 2015and February28, 2014were as follows:TypeAbility to ChooseInvestmentsNet ReturnTarget Asset Allocation as of February 27, 2015Net Cash Surrender ValueFebruary27, 2015February28, 2014Whole lifeCOLI policiesNo abilityA rate of return set periodically by theinsurance companiesNot  lifeCOLI policiesCan allocate across a set of choices provided by the insurance companiesFluctuates depending on performance of underlying investments40% fixed income; 60%  is a summary of the allocation of COLI income for 2015, 2014and 2013:COLI  of sales Operating expenses421658Operating income421658Investment income lossIncome before income tax expense$42$16$582014Cost of sales$06$$06Operating expenses450954Operating income510960Investment income1818Income before income tax expense$51$09$422013Cost of sales$12$$12Operating expenses4646Operating income5858Investment income3030Income before income tax expense$58$30$8859Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETSA summary of the changes in goodwill during the years ended February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, by reportable segment, is as  impairment  as of February 22,  1123123Currency translation  impairment  as of February 28, 2014$896$$185$1081Currency translation  impairment  as of February 27,  2014, we recorded goodwill impairment charges in our Asia Pacific reporting unit. See further details below.Our goodwill impairment evaluation is a two step process. In step one, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired, and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform step two to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In step two, the reporting unit fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.We estimated the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach, which calculates the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of its estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The estimation of the fair value of our reporting units represents a Level 3 measurement.Based on the results of the annual impairment test, we concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as of February27, 2015. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 81%to approximately 278%of carrying value. We will continue to evaluate goodwill, on an annual basis in Q4, and whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management business strategy or significant declines in our stock price, indicate that there may be a potential indicator of impairment.In 2014, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our Asia Pacific reporting unit in the Other category had fallen below its carrying value. We recorded a $123goodwill impairment charge, fully impairing goodwill in the Asia Pacific reporting unit as of February28, 2014. Additionally, we tested the recoverability of the Asia Pacific long-lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets as of February27, 2015and February 28, 2014 and concluded that these assets were not impaired.As of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, our other intangible assets and related accumulated amortization consisted of the following:60Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedOther Intangible AssetsFebruary27, 2015February28,  assets subject to amortization:Proprietary   assets not subject to  2014, we recorded a charge of $06in Asia Pacific for impairment of other intangible assets.

All contributions are made to a trust which is held for the sole benefit of participants. Company contributions for this plan are discretionary and can be declared by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors any time during each fiscal year. Our other defined contribution retirement plans provide for matching contributions and/or discretionary contributions declared by management.Total expense under all defined contribution retirement plans was $263for 2015, $226for 2014and $190for 2013. We expect to fund approximately $306related to our defined contribution plans in 2016, including funding related to our discretionary profit sharing contributions.Post-Retirement Medical BenefitsWe maintain post-retirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance benefits to certain North American-based retirees and eligible dependents. The plans were frozen to new participants in 2003. We accrue the cost of post-retirement benefits during the service periods of employees based on actuarial calculations for each plan. These plans are unfunded, but our investments in COLI policies are intended to be utilized as a long-term funding source for these benefit obligations. See Note9for additional information.

In 2013, due to a change in the participation assumption resulting from actual participation rates during the year, the accumulated post-retirement projected benefit obligation was reduced by $124.Defined Benefit Pension PlansOur defined benefit pension plans include various qualified domestic and foreign retirement plans as well as non-qualified supplemental retirement plans that are limited to a select group of management approved by the Compensation Committee. The benefit plan obligations for the non-qualified supplemental retirement plans are primarily related to the Steelcase Inc. Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan. In Q4 2015, we closed the plan to new participants and froze the benefits under the plan for current participants upon vesting.The amendment resulted in a decrease to the pension benefit obligation of $14. This plan is unfunded, but our investments in COLI policies are intended to be utilized as a long-term funding source for these benefit obligations. See Note9for additional information.

The investment strategy for the domestic plans is to maximize returns while taking into consideration the investment horizon and expected volatility to ensure there are sufficient assets to pay benefits as they come due.The investments of the foreign plans are managed by third-party investment managers who follow local regulations. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes or individual securities in order to reduce market risk and assure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due.Our pension plans weighted-average investment allocation strategies and weighted-average target asset allocations by asset category as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014are reflected in the following table.

This plan provides retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed by employers and unions; however, we are not a trustee. The trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plan.Based on the most recent information available, we believe that the projected benefit obligations in this multi-employer plan significantly exceed the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits. Because we are one of a number of employers contributing to this plan, it is difficult to ascertain what the exact amount of the under-funding would be, although we anticipate the contribution per participating employee will increase at each contract renegotiation. We believe that funding levels have not changed significantly since year-end.The risks of participating in a multi-employer plan are different from the risks associated with single-employer plans in the following respects:Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.If a participating employer chooses to stop participating in a multi-employer plan or otherwise has participation in the plan drop below certain levels, that employer may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.Our participation in this plan is outlined in the tables below. Expense is recognized at the time our contributions are funded, in accordance with applicable accounting standards.

The first deferred compensation program is closed to new entrants. In this program, certain employees elected to defer a portion of their compensation in return for a fixed benefit to be paid in installments beginning when the participant reaches age70. Under the second plan, certain employees may elect to defer a portion of their compensation. The third plan is intended to restore retirement benefits that would otherwise be paid under the Retirement Plan but are precluded as a result of the limitations on eligible compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section401a17. Under the fourth plan, our non-employee directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their board retainer and committee fees. The deferred amounts in the last three plans earn a return based on the investment option selected by the participant.These deferred compensation obligations are unfunded, but our investments in COLI policies are intended to be utilized as a long-term funding source for these deferred compensation obligations. See Note9for additional information.Deferred compensation expense, which represents annual participant earnings on amounts that have been deferred, and restoration retirement benefits were $57for 2015, $50for 2014and $48for 201314.CAPITAL STRUCTURETerms of ClassA Common Stock and ClassB Common StockThe holders of common stock are generally entitled to vote as a single class on all matters upon which shareholders have a right to vote, subject to the requirements of applicable laws and the rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock to vote as a separate class. Each share of ClassA Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote, and each share of ClassB Common Stock entitles its holder to 10 votes. Each share of ClassB Common Stock is convertible into a share of ClassA Common Stock on a one-for-one basis iat the option of the holder at any time, iiupon transfer to a person or entity which is not a Permitted Transferee as defined in our Second 73Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedRestated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, iiiwith respect to shares of ClassB Common Stock acquired after February20, 1998, at such time as a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust or charitable organization holding such shares ceases to be controlled or owned 100% by Permitted Transferees and ivon the date on which the number of shares of ClassB Common Stock outstanding is less than 15% of all of the then outstanding shares of common stock calculated without regard to voting rights.Except for the voting and conversion features described above, the terms of ClassA Common Stock and ClassB Common Stock are generally similar. That is, the holders are entitled to equal dividends when declared by our Board of Directors and generally will receive the same per share consideration in the event of a merger and be treated on an equal per share basis in the event of a liquidation or winding up of Steelcase Inc. In addition, we are not entitled to issue additional shares of ClassB Common Stock, or issue options, rights or warrants to subscribe for additional shares of ClassB Common Stock, except that we may make a pro rata offer to all holders of common stock of rights to purchase additional shares of the class of common stock held by them, and any dividend payable in common stock will be paid in the form of ClassA Common Stock to ClassA holders and ClassB Common Stock to ClassB holders. Neither class of stock may be split, divided or combined unless the other class is proportionally split, divided or combined.Preferred StockOur Second Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize our Board of Directors, without any vote or action by our shareholders, to create one or more series of preferred stock up to the limit of our authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and to fix the designations, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, including the voting rights, dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, terms of redemption including sinking fund provisions, redemption price or prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series.Share Repurchases and ConversionsDuring 2015, we repurchased 24 millionshares of our ClassA Common Stock for $363.

Additionally, other cash dividends received from our Canadian subsidiary resulted in excess foreign tax credits of $09in 2013. Foreign tax credit carryforwards of $209as of February 27, 2015 are expected to be utilized within the remaining allowable 10 year carryfoward period. 4The valuation allowance provisions were based on current year activity, and the valuation allowance adjustments were based on various factors, which are further detailed below5The impairment charges related to goodwill recorded in purchase accounting are non-deductible6The increase in the cash surrender value of COLI policies, net of normal insurance expenses, plus death benefit gains are non-taxable7The foreign operations, less applicable foreign tax credits, amounts include the rate differential on foreign operations and the impact of rate reductions in foreign jurisdictions.

Under U.S. GAAP, we are generally required to record U.S. deferred taxes on the anticipated repatriation of foreign income as the income is recognized for financial reporting purposes. An exception under certain accounting guidance permits us not to record a U.S. deferred tax liability for foreign income that we expect to reinvest in foreign operations and for which remittance will be postponed indefinitely. If it becomes apparent that some or all undistributed income will be remitted in the foreseeable future, the related deferred taxes are recorded in that period. In determining indefinite reinvestment, we regularly evaluate the capital needs of our foreign operations considering all available information, including operating and capital plans, regulatory capital requirements, debt requirements and cash flow needs, as well as the applicable tax laws to which our foreign subsidiaries are subject. We expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from future foreign operations to be sufficient to fund foreign operations. Debt and capital financing are available from the U.S. in the event foreign circumstances change. In addition, we expect our existing domestic cash balances and availability of domestic financing sources to be sufficient to fund domestic operating activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is available domestically, we could repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions, which could result in higher effective tax rates. As of February 27, 2015, we have not made a provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $1528of unremitted foreign earnings we consider permanently reinvested. We believe the U.S. tax cost, net of related foreign tax credits, on the unremitted foreign earnings would be approximately $128if the amounts were not considered permanently reinvested.We establish valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. All evidence, both positive and negative, is identified and considered in making the determination. Future realization of the existing deferred tax asset ultimately depends, in 77Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedpart, on the existence of sufficient taxable income of appropriate character within the carryforward period available under tax law applicable in the jurisdiction in which the losses were incurred.  At February 27, 2015, the valuation allowance of $727is comprised of $723relating to foreign deferred tax assets, of which $611relates to our French subsidiaries.  In 2015, we recorded a decrease of $91related to the valuation allowance, primarily due to currency fluctuations of $138, which was partially offset by increases due to current losses of $47, of which $34related to our French subsidiaries. In 2014, we recorded a net increase of $114related to the valuation allowance, of which $59related to our French subsidiaries.Deferred tax assets related to our French subsidiaries are fully reserved. Therefore, in 2015, the increase in the valuation allowance is due to additional current year losses. The valuation allowances of the remaining entities increased due to updated assessments about the ultimate realization of the related deferred tax assets.In updating our assessment of the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets, we considered the following factors:the nature, frequency and severity of cumulative losses in recent years,the predictability of future income,prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that could be implemented, to protect the loss of the deferred tax assets andthe effect of reversing taxable temporary differences.Based on our evaluation of these factors, particularly increasing cumulative losses and the continuing inability to materially achieve sales and profit projections, we were unable to assert that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in France, our owned dealer in the United Kingdom, Morocco, China, the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Belgium would be realized as of February 27, 2015.In Q4 2015, we implemented changes in EMEA to align our tax structure with the management of our globally integrated business. Our U.S. parent company became the principal in a contract manufacturing model with our Steelcase European subsidiaries. We believe that this new model will generate taxable income for our Steelcase European subsidiaries and potentially allow for utilization of net operating loss carryforwards which currently reflect valuation allowances. As of February 27, 2015, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our French net deferred tax assets, totaling $611due to the long history of large net operating losses in France, including losses generated in 2015, and the fact that the contract manufacturing model was not fully implemented in 2015. It is possible that sufficient positive evidence may become available in 2016 or future periods to reach a conclusion that the valuation allowance should be reversed. A change in judgment regarding our expected ability to realize net deferred tax assets would be accounted for as a discrete tax benefit in the period in which it occurs.Current Taxes Payable or RefundableIncome taxes currently payable or refundable are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:Current Income TaxesFebruary27, 2015February28, 2014Other current assets:Income taxes receivable$109$39Accrued expenses:Income taxes payable$28$2678Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedNet Operating Loss and Tax Credit CarryforwardsOperating loss and tax credit carryforwards expire as follows:Year Ending FebruaryNet Operating LossCarryforwards GrossTax Effected Net Operating LossCarryforwardsTax     tax benefits for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not. It is considered more likely than not that a benefit of $419will be realized on these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. This determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax, business and other planning strategies available to us will enable utilization of the carryforwards. We assess the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances are recorded to the extent realization of these carryovers is not more likely than not.Uncertain Tax PositionsWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various states and foreign jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation. Tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions include, the United States 2015, Canada 2011 through 2015, France 2010 through 2015 and Germany 2013 through 2015. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances.We are audited by the U.S.Internal Revenue Service under the Compliance Assurance Process CAP. Under CAP, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service works with large business taxpayers to identify and resolve issues prior to the filing of a tax return. Accordingly, we record minimal liabilities for U.S.Federal uncertain tax positions.We recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in income tax expense, and these items were insignificant for 2015, 2014and 2013.As of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, the liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows:Liability for Uncertain Tax PositionsFebruary27, 2015February28, 2014Other accrued expenses$$Other long-term liabilities0222$02$22The decrease of $20in 2015 was primarily due to settlements and resolutions of income tax audits79Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:Unrecognized Tax BenefitsYear EndedFebruary27, 2015February28, 2014February22, 2013Balance as of beginning of period$127$122$115Gross increasestax positions in prior period0416Gross decreasestax positions in prior period1909Gross increasestax positions in current period01Currency translation adjustment20Balance as of end of  tax benefits of $02, if favorably resolved, would affect our effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to expiring statutes or audit activity in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved; however, we do not anticipate any significant changes within the next twelve months. We have taken tax positions in a non-U.S. jurisdiction that do not meet the more likely than not test required under the uncertain tax position accounting guidance. Since the tax positions have increased net operating loss carryforwards, the underlying deferred tax asset is shown net of the liability for uncertain tax positions. If we prevail on these tax positions, which total $86, the resolution of these items would not impact tax expense, since the positions were taken in countries where we currently have recorded full valuation allowances16.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATIONThe Steelcase Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan the Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the issuance of share-based compensation awards to employees and members of the Board of Directors. There are 25,000,000shares of ClassA Common Stock reserved for issuance under our Incentive Compensation Plan, with 9,876,773and 11,317,414shares remaining for future issuance under our Incentive Compensation Plan as of February 27, 2015and February 28, 2014, respectively.A variety of awards may be granted under the Incentive Compensation Plan, including stock options, stock appreciation rights SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, phantom shares and other share-based awards. Outstanding awards under the Incentive Compensation Plan vest over a period of three or five years or at the time a participant becomes a qualified retiree. Stock options granted under the Incentive Compensation Plan may be either incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code or non-qualified stock options not so intended. Our Board of Directors may amend or terminate the Incentive Compensation Plan at its discretion subject to certain provisions as stipulated within the plan.Share-based awards currently outstanding under the Incentive Compensation Plan are as follows:Total Outstanding AwardsFebruary27, 2015Performance units 11,418,312Restricted stock units2,110,822Total outstanding  amount includes the maximum number of shares that may be issued under outstanding performance unit awards; however, the actual number of shares which may be issued will be determined based on the satisfaction of certain criteria, and therefore may be significantly lower.The share-based compensation awards outstanding as of February 27, 2015consist of restricted stock units and performance units, and the majority of the outstanding awards are held by our executive officers.In the event of a change of control, as defined in the Incentive Compensation Plan,80Table of ContentsSTEELCASE INC.NOTESTO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedif at least six months have elapsed following the award date, any performance-based conditions imposed with respect to outstanding awards shall be deemed to be fully earned and a pro rata portion of each such outstanding award granted for all outstanding performance periods shall become payable in shares of ClassA Common Stock;andall restrictions imposed on restricted stock units that are not performance-based shall lapse.Performance UnitsPerformance units have been granted only to our executive officers. These awards are earned after a three-year performance period and only if the performance criteria stated in the applicable award are achieved. After completion of the performance period, the number of performance units earned will be issued as shares of ClassA Common Stock. The aggregate number of shares of ClassA Common Stock that ultimately may be issued under performance units where the performance period has not been completed ranged from 0to 1,418,312shares as of February 27, 2015. The awards will be forfeited if a participant leaves the company for reasons other than retirement, disability or death or if the participant engages in any competition with us, as defined in the Incentive Compensation Plan and determined by the Administrative Committee in its discretion.A dividend equivalent is calculated based on the actual number of units earned at the end of the performance period equal to the dividends that would have been payable on the earned units had they been held during the entire performance period as ClassA Common Stock. At the end of the performance period, the dividend equivalents are paid in the form of cash or ClassA Common Stock at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Half of the performance units granted in 2015and 2014can be earned based on our three-year average return on invested capital ROIC PSUs, which is a performance condition. The number of shares that may be earned under the ROIC PSUs can range from 0%to 200%of the target amount. The ROIC PSUs are expensed and recorded in Additional paid-in capitalon the Consolidated Balance Sheets over the performance periods based on the probability that the performance condition will be met. The expense recorded will be adjusted as the estimate of the total number of ROIC PSUs that will ultimately be earned changes. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of ROIC PSUs granted was $1669. The fair value is equal to the closing price on the date of the grant. The remaining half of the performance units granted in 2015and 2014and all performance units granted in 2013can be earned based on achievement of certain total shareholder return results relative to a comparison group of companies TSR PSUs, which is a market condition. The number of units that may be earned under the TSR PSUs can range from 0%to 200%of the target amount. The TSR PSUs are expensed and recorded in Additional paid-in capitalon the Consolidated Balance Sheets over the performance periods. Based on actual performance results, the TSR PSUs granted in 2013 were earned at 200%of the target level and 1,026,000shares of Class A Common Stock were issued to participants in Q1 2016. The TSR PSUs granted in 2012 were earned at1066%of the target level and453,627shares of Class A Common Stock were issued to participants inQ1 2015.The fair values of the TSR PSUs were calculated on their respective grant dates using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which resulted in a fair value of $61, $57and $64for the TSR PSUs granted in 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.
