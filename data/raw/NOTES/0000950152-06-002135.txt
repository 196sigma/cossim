23 Table of Contents REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING We, the management of LCA-Vision Inc., are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f, the consolidated financial statements, and the information contained in this
report, including its accuracy. We prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition to selecting appropriate
accounting principles, we are responsible for the way information is presented and its reliability.
To report financial results we must often make estimates based on currently available information
and judgments of current conditions and circumstances. We assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSOin Internal Control 
Integrated Framework. As a result of this assessment management believes that, as of December31,
2005, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria
described above. No matter how well designed, all internal control systems have inherent
limitations and even those systems determined to be effective provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Our assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.

Principal Financial and Accounting Officer 24 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of LCA-Vision Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LCA-Vision Inc. as of December31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders investment, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at a2.These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of LCA-Vision Inc. at December31, 2005 and 2004, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule for each of the
three years ended December31, 2005, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of LCA-Vision Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated March1, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Ernst Young LLP

of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on
Managements Assessment of Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Shareholders of LCA-Vision Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Report of Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that LCA-Vision Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. LCA-Vision Inc.s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that LCA-Vision Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, LCA-Vision Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005,
based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of LCA-Vision Inc. as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
investment, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005 of
LCA-Vision Inc. and our report dated March1, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Ernst Young LLP

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 30 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description Of Business And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies Business We are a leading developer and operator of fixed-site laser vision correction centers at our
LasikPlus vision centers. Our vision centers provide the staff, facilities, equipment and support
services for performing laser vision correction that employ advanced laser technologies to help
correct nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. We currently use fixed-site excimer lasers
manufactured by Bausch Lomb, Advanced Medical Optics and Alcon. Our vision centers are supported
mainly by independent board-certified ophthalmologists and credentialed optometrists as well as
other health care professionals. The ophthalmologists perform the laser vision correction
procedures in our vision centers, and either ophthalmologists or optometrists conduct pre-procedure
evaluations and post-operative follow-ups in-center. We have performed over 550,000 laser vision
correction procedures in our vision centers in the United States and Canada since 1991. Most of
our patients receive a procedure called LASIK, which we began performing in the United States in
1997. We currently own and operate 50 LasikPlus fixed-site laser vision correction centers generally
located in larger metropolitan markets in the United States, and a joint venture in Canada. Consolidation Policy We use two different methods to report our investments in our subsidiaries and other companies 
consolidation and the equity method. Consolidation We use the consolidation method to report our investment in subsidiaries and other companies when
we own a majority of the voting stock of the subsidiary. In addition, we consolidate the results
of operations of professional corporations with which we contract to provide the services of
ophthalmologists or optometrists at our vision centers, in accordance with EITF 97-2, Application
of FASB Statement No94 and APB Opinion No16 to Physician Management Entities and Certain Other
Entities with Contractual Management Agreements. Prior to September2002, our contractual
management arrangements did not permit consolidation of our relationships with professional
corporations pursuant to EITF 97-2 because we did not maintain a controlling financial interest
in the professional corporations. Beginning in September2002, we began a process of renewing our
agreements with the professional corporations and opening new vision centers with agreements that
meet the controlling financial interest criteria of EITF 97-2. As a result of the FASBs issuance of Interpretation No46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No51, in January2003, we evaluated the contractual
management arrangements entered into with professional corporations after January1, 2003 and
determined that consolidation of these entities was appropriate under the FIN 46 guidance. With
respect to the three remaining professional corporations with which we had a contractual management
arrangement prior to January1, 2003, we began consolidating these entities as of July1, 2003,
which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Equity Method   We use the equity method to report investments in businesses where we hold a 20% to 50% voting
interest, giving us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating
and financial policies. Under the equity method, we report   
Our interest in the entity as an investment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and   
Our percentage share of the earnings lossesin our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We disposed of our 43% interest of Silmalaseri Oy, a joint venture in Europe, in 2004. We own 50%
of Eyemed/LCAVision, LLC. We report these investments under the equity method. We currently own a non-controlling interest in Lasik M.D. Toronto. Prior to the third quarter of
2005, financial results for our Canadian joint venture were consolidated into our financial
statements. During the third quarter of 2005, we transferred financial and operational control of
the joint venture to our partners in Toronto. Therefore, effective July1, 2005, we began to
account for the results of the Canadian venture using the equity method. While there is currently
no material difference in the net income or earnings per share as a result of this change, our
revenues and reported procedural volume no longer include the procedures performed in Canada. 31 Table of Contents Use of Estimates Management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements under accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain estimates are particularly sensitive
due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may
differ significantly from managements expectations. These estimates and assumptions affect various
matters including   
Allowance for doubtful accounts patient financing   
Loss reserves insurance captive Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purpose of reporting our cash flows, we consider highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of 90days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at
cost, which approximates market value. Trade Receivables Trade receivables are comprised primarily of amounts owed to the Company from patients and from
professional corporations $14,797,000 at December31, 2005 and $12,432,000 at December31, 2004.
Trade receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $3,145,000 and
$2,865,000 at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For patients that we finance with an
initial term over 12months, we recognize revenues based upon the present values of the expected
payments. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We provide patient financing to some of our customers, including those who could not otherwise
obtain third-party financing. The terms of the financing require the patient to pay an up-front fee
which is intended to cover some or all of our variable costs, and the remainder is deducted
automatically from the patients checking account over a period of 12 to 36months. We began our
patient financing program in May2002. Based upon our own experience with patient financing and
based upon the credit experience of centers that provide financing to customers similar to ours, we
have established allowance for doubtful accounts as of December31, 2005 of $3,145,000 against
accounts receivable of $14,797,000. Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Amortization Property and Equipment We show our property and equipment at its original cost, net of accumulated depreciation. At the
time property or equipment is retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation or amortization are deducted from the amounts reported in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets and any gains or losses on disposition are recognized in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. We expense repair and maintenance costs as incurred. Assets recorded under
capitalized leases are amortized to expense which is included in the Depreciation and Amortization
expense. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation using the straight-line method which recognizes the cost of the asset over
its estimated useful life. We use the following estimated useful lives for computing the annual
depreciation expense: building and building improvements, 5 to 39years; furniture and fixtures, 3
to 7years; medical equipment, 3 to 5years; other equipment, 3 to 5years. Amortization of
leasehold improvements is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations using the
straight-line method based on the lesser of the useful life of the improvement or the lease term
which is typically five years or less. We assess the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying value might not be recoverable. Estimates of future cash flows are used to determine
if there is impairment; discounted cash flows are used to determine the amount of impairment. Deferred Compensation Plan Assets The deferred compensation plan assets are invested in a variety of mutual funds including a money
market fund, a bond fund and several equity funds. Assets are reported at fair market value. 32 Table of Contents Financial Instruments Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
temporary cash investments. Our policy is to place our temporary cash investments in short-term
investment-grade, interest-bearing corporate securities or obligations of, or guaranteed by, the
U.S. government. Fair Values of Financial Instruments The cost basis of our cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables with an initial term within 12
months and accounts payable approximate their fair values due to their short term maturities. For
trade receivables with an initial term in excess of 12months, we record the present value of the
expected payments discounted at a rate of 175percent per year. Captive Insurance Company Reserves Effective December18, 2002, we established a captive insurance company to provide professional
liability insurance coverage for claims brought against us after December17, 2002. In addition,
our captive insurance companys charter allows it to provide professional liability insurance for
our doctors, some of whom are currently insured by the captive. Our captive insurance company is
managed by an independent insurance consulting and management firm, and it is capitalized and
funded by us based on actuarial studies performed by an affiliate of the consulting and management
firm. Beginning December18, 2003, the Company elected to use the captive insurance company for
both the primary insurance and the excess liability coverage. A number of claims are now pending
with our captive insurance company. The financial statements of the captive insurance company are
consolidated with our financial statements since it is a wholly-owned enterprise. As of December
31, 2005, we recorded an insurance reserve amount of $3,840,000, which primarily represents an
actuarially determined estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Income Taxes At December31, 2005, we had approximately $5,200,000 of net operating loss carryforwards that can
be used to reduce future taxable income. The entire net operating loss carryforward of $5,200,000
is subject to an IRC Section382 annual limitation of $3,250,000. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $10,489,000 in the first six months of 2004 as a
result of a reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. A benefit of $5,900,000 was
recorded in the first quarter of 2004, and the balance of $4,589,000 was recorded in the second
quarter of 2004. The reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets was made because
of continued profitability of the Company in 2004 and our expected future profitability. As a
result, we currently believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset relating
primarily to our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards will be realized to the extent of the tax
benefit recorded. The computation of our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance is based on
taxable income we expect to earn over future periods, which will include the utilization of
previously accumulated net operating tax losses. During the year ended December31, 2004, we
applied approximately $24,727,000 of our net operating losses against our taxable income for the
period, which resulted in reduced federal income tax expenses and tax payments of approximately
$8,654,000. Net operating loss carryforwards at December31, 2004 were approximately $15,000,000. We acquired approximately $19,000,000 of net operating loss carryforwards in 1997 when we purchased
Refractive Centers International, Inc. The use of these acquired net operating losses was subject
to annual IRC 382 limitation of $2,500,000. During 2003 and 2004, we used all of the net operating
loss carryforwards acquired from Refractive Centers International. Per Share Data Basic per-share data is income applicable to common shares divided by the weighted average common
shares outstanding. Diluted per share data is income applicable to common shares divided by the
weighted average common shares outstanding plus the potential issuance of common shares if
in-the-money stock options are exercised. The total number of unexercised options as of December31 was

Revenue Recognition Other than for patients for whom we provide financing with an initial term over 12months, we
recognize revenues as services are performed. Stock-Based Compensation In December2002, SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure, which amends SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, was issued. SFAS
No148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and requires more prominent and more
frequent disclosures in the financial statements of the effects of stock-based compensation. The
provisions of SFAS No148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2002. We apply APB No25 and related interpretations utilizing the intrinsic value method in accounting
for our stock option plans. We have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No123. Prior
to January1, 2006, we recognized no compensation expense for our stock options granted to
employees or directors. If we had elected to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value
at the grant dates consistent with the provisions of SFAS No123, net income and net income per
share would have been changed to the pro forma amounts indicated below dollars in thousands,
except per share amounts

Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No123 and supersedes APB Opinion No25. SFAS
No123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to be expensed over the applicable
vesting period. Pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based payments is no
longer an alternative. SFAS No123R is effective for all stock-based awards granted on or after
January1, 2006. In addition, companies must recognize compensation expense related to any awards
that are not fully vested as of the effective date. Compensation expense for the unvested awards
will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro
forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123. See Stock-Based Compensation
above for information had SFAS No123R been in effect at
December31, 2005. We anticipate the impact of adopting
SFAS123R will decrease net income by $39 million to $44
million in 2006. 2. Stockholders Investment Common Stock We are authorized to issue up to 275million shares of common stock. In 2005, our Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of our common stock. 50,000 shares
were repurchased during 2005. At December31, 2005, the number of shares reserved for future
issuance was 2,066,624 shares under stock incentive plans. Preferred stock At December31, 2005, there were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Treasury stock At December31, 2005, there were 3,600,794 shares of common stock held in treasury. 3. Credit Arrangements The Companys revolving credit facility matured on July31, 2004. Management did not anticipate
needing to utilize a credit facility and chose to not seek renewal of the credit facility at such
time. 4. Investment in Unconsolidated Businesses Our investments in unconsolidated businesses were $158,000 and $168,000 at December31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. At December31, 2005, we had equity investments in Eyemed/LCA-Vision, LLC and
Lasik M.D. Toronto Inc. Combined summary financial information for these entities is as follows dollars in thousands

The Company reversed the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in 2004 by recording an income
tax benefit of $10,489,000 in the first six months of 2004. A benefit of $5,900,000 was recorded
in the first quarter of 2004, and the balance of $4,589,000 was recorded in the second quarter of
2004. The reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets was made because of continued
profitability of the Company in 2004 and expected future profitability. As a result, we currently
believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset relating primarily to our U.S. net
operating loss carryforwards will be realized to the extent of the tax benefit recorded. The
computation of our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance is based on taxable income we expect
to earn over future periods, which will include the utilization of previously accumulated net
operating tax losses. We are required to pay franchise taxes in most of the states in which we have operations due to our
net operating loss carryforwards. We have included the franchise taxes paid in general and
administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The foreign tax provisions consist primarily of Canadian income taxes. We have made no provision
for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings from our international businesses because it is our
intention to reinvest those earnings in those operations. If those earnings are distributed in the
form of dividends, we may be subject to both foreign withholding taxes and U.S. income taxes net of
allowable foreign tax credits. Pretax income for the last three years has been

At December31, 2005 and 2004 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards for income tax
purposes of approximately $5,200,000 and $15,000,000, respectively. These expire in varying
amounts from 2017 until 2022. We acquired approximately $19,000,000 of net operating loss carryforwards in 1997 when we purchased
Refractive Centers International, Inc. The use of these acquired net operating losses was subject
to annual IRC 382 limitation of $2,500,000. During 2003 and 2004, we used all of the net operating
loss carryforwards acquired from Refractive Centers International. At December31, 2005, we had approximately $5,200,000 of net operating loss carryforwards that can
be used to reduce future taxable income. The entire net operating loss carryforward, $5,200,000,
is subject to an annual IRC Section382 limitation of $3,250,000. 37 Table of Contents 6. Leasing Arrangements We lease office space for our vision centers.

The net book value of assets under capitalized leases at December31, 2005 was $4,154,000. Total rent expense under operating leases amounted to $6,385,000 in 2005; $5,538,000 in 2004; and
$4,428,000 in 2003. 7. Employee Benefits Savings Plan We sponsor a savings plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401k to provide an opportunity for
eligible employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Under this plan, we may make
discretionary contributions to the participants accounts. We made contributions of $52,000 in
2005; $41,000 in 2004; and $0 in 2003. Stock Incentive Plans We have three stock incentive plans, the 1995 Long Term-Stock Incentive Plan 1995 Plan, the
1998 Long Term-Stock Incentive Plan 1998 Plan and the 2001 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan
2001 Plan. A maximum of 937,500 shares are reserved for the 1995 Plan, 1,875,000 shares are
reserved for the 1998 Plan and 937,500 shares are reserved for the 2001 Plan. The Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors administers all of our stock incentive plans. The Plans permit us to issue incentive and/or nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of
common stock, stock appreciation rights, and other stock awards to employees and consultants. The
1998 Plan is used to grant stock options to our non-employee directors. Non-employee directors
receive an option to purchase 28,125 shares of our common stock upon initial election or
appointment and an automatic option grant of 4,688 shares upon reelection. Prior to our
stockholders approving the 1998 Plan, we granted our non-employee directors stock options under the
LCA-Vision Inc. Directors Nondiscretionary Stock Option Plan, which was discontinued in 1998. Stock options are granted with an exercise price not less than fair market value on the date of
grant. Stock options granted generally become exercisable over 3 to 5years after their date of
grant; the maximum term is 10years from the date of grant. 38 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the status of options granted under our 1995, 1998 and 2001 Plans

Companys Chief Executive Officer CEOand Chief Financial Officer CFO, an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures was performed. Based on this
evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of December31, 2005 to ensure that material information is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported by management of the Company on a timely basis in order to comply with the
Companys disclosure obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules
thereunder. In addition, no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting occurred during
the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, LCA-Visions internal control over financial reporting. The
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists of our independent Directors, meets
periodically with management and Ernst Young LLP to review the activities of each in discharging
their responsibilities. Ernst Young LLP has free access to the Audit Committee and to all
Company records and personnel in connection with its audits. Managements report on internal control over financial reporting Information on the Companys internal control over financial reporting is contained in Item8.
