ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF
ADVANTAGE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advantage
Learning Systems, Inc. a Wisconsin corporation and subsidiaries as of December
31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated and combined statements of
income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated and combined financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Advantage Learning Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and
1997, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

ADVANTAGE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the financial results of
Advantage Learning Systems, Inc. ALS and its subsidiaries, collectively the
Company. The Company significant subsidiaries include the Institute for
Academic Excellence, Inc. Institute and IPS Publishing, Inc. IPS. The
Company also owns 70% of Athena Holdings LLC which was formed for the purpose of
constructing a facility in Madison, Wisconsin. Combined equity represents the
combination of the common stock, paid-in capital and retained earnings of ALS,
the Institute, and IPS. Effective January 2, 1997, the Institute and IPS became
wholly owned subsidiaries of ALS. As a result, subsequent periods are presented
on a consolidated basis. All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in the consolidated and combined financial statements.
2 NATURE OF OPERATIONS
ALS is a provider of learning information systems to K-12 schools in the
United States and Canada. ALS flagship product is the Accelerated Reader, a
learning information system for motivating and monitoring increased
literature-based reading practice. ALS has also developed STAR Reading, a
computer-adaptive reading test and database. In 1998, the Company introduced
Accelerated Math and STAR Math, software products that apply to math the
principles that have made the reading software effective in improving academic
performance, Perfect Copy, writing skills development software, and Math
Renaissance, professional development training in math.
The Institute develops and conducts Renaissance training programs, which
provide educators with professional development training to most effectively use
ALS products and the learning information they generate.
IPS provides customized software to publishers for assessment and skills
practice in math, science, and other subjects. Additionally, IPS develops
content for math products distributed by the Company.
3 ACQUISITIONS
Effective June 30, 1998, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of Logicus
Incorporated Logicus, an Ontario, Canada-based firm specializing in writing
skills development software. The transaction was accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting, and the results of operations of Logicus have
been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of
acquisition. The purchase price included the acquisition of certain in process
research and development which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $475,000 in the
second quarter of 1998. The acquisition of Logicus had no material effect on the
results of operations of the Company in 1998. Pro forma results for 1998 and
1997 would not be materially different from actual.
Effective August 1, 1996, IPS Acquisition, Inc. Acquisition acquired
substantially all of the assets of IPS. Acquisition was formed by the
shareholders of ALS for the sole purpose of acquiring certain assets of IPS.
Acquisition was capitalized with $200,000 of equity and $47 million of loans
from shareholders. Subsequent to the transaction, Acquisition changed its name
to IPS Publishing, Inc.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
The net purchase price was comprised of $4,610,000 cash paid at closing 265,177 cash paid in 1997 and $500,000 of ALS common stock given at the closing
date of the Initial Public Offering of the Company common stock in 1997 see
Note 5. The purchase price included the acquisition of certain in process
research and development which resulted in a pre-tax charge to income of
$3,400,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996.

4 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
b Revenue recognition
In 1997 the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the AICPA issued
Statement of Position No. 97-2 SOP 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition. This
SOP was issued to provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting
principles to software transactions and to narrow the range of revenue
recognition practices that were in use before its issuance. SOP 97-2 is
generally effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1997. The adoption of SOP 97-2 had no material impact on the
Company results of operations in 1998.
Revenue from product sales is recognized when the products are shipped, net
of estimated allowances for product returns and exchanges. Allowances for bad
debts and post-contract support obligations, primarily telephone support
provided by ALS, are also accrued for at the time of the sale.
Revenue from IPS custom products is recognized on the percentage of
completion method. IPS defers revenue for advance payments from customers that
are in excess of revenues earned. Included in receivables at December 31, 1998
and 1997 is $198,000 and $49,000, respectively, of amounts earned on contracts
which are not yet billable.
The Institute generates service revenue both from i conducting seminars
and ii contracts with schools and school districts to provide training
programs and consulting services. The Institute recognizes revenue from the
seminars at the time the seminar actually takes place. For school and school
district contracts, revenue is generally recognized when the training session is
performed, while certain support services are recognized on a straight-line
basis over the life of the contract. The Institute includes as deferred revenue
i prepayments on contract revenues and ii payments received for seminars not
yet held.
Service revenues include software support provided as part of the software
product sale and separately sold maintenance fees whereby ALS provides ongoing
customer support and product upgrades. Such separately sold contracts are
reflected as deferred revenue and are amortized ratably over the term of the
maintenance period which begins after the expiration of any support included
with the purchase of the software. Revenue from support agreements included with
the purchase of software is included in service revenue at the time the software
is shipped.
c Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers cash amounts on deposit at banks and highly liquid
debt instruments purchased with a maturity date of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Commercial paper is carried at cost plus

Income   6,606    1,564      
e Short term investments
Short term investments have an original maturity of more than three months
and a remaining maturity of less than one year. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997
short term investments consisted entirely of commercial paper. These securities
are considered to be held to maturity in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 SFAS 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities. Accordingly, these investments are carried at cost
plus accrued interest which approximates market value.
f Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of first-in, first-out FIFO cost or
market. Inventories primarily consist of purchased materials which include
manuals, diskettes and motivational items.
g Catalog and advertising costs
Costs related to direct response advertising, primarily catalogs, are
capitalized over their expected period of future benefits, generally three to
six months. At December 31, 1998 and 1997 capitalized catalog costs of
approximately $113,000 and $43,000, respectively, are included in prepaid
expenses. All other advertising costs are expensed the first time the
advertising takes place. Advertising expenses for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were
approximately $6,202,000, $4,377,000 and $2,999,000, respectively.
h Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over
the estimated useful lives of the assets using principally the straight-line
method for financial reporting purposes. Maintenance and repair costs are
charged to expense as incurred, and renewals and improvements that extend the
useful life of the assets are added to the plant and equipment accounts.
Depreciation expense was approximately $1,401,000, $975,000 and $401,000 for
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
The estimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment are as
follows: buildings -- 25 to 40 years; furniture, fixtures and office equipment
- -- 5 to 8 years; computer and production equipment -- 3 to 5 years; and vehicles
- -- 5 years.

i Software development costs
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86
SFAS 86 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or
Otherwise Marketed, the Company capitalizes certain software development costs
incurred after technological feasibility is achieved. Capitalized costs are
reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized
software development costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis based on
the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current gross
revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross
revenues for that product or b the straight-line method over the estimated
economic life of the products which is generally estimated to be 24 months.
Amortization begins when the products are available for general release to
customers. All other research and development expenditures are charged to
product development expense in the period incurred. Amounts capitalized were
approximately $194,000, $4,000 and $365,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. Amortization expense of approximately $163,000, $241,000 and
$208,000 for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, is included in cost of
sales-products in the statements of income. At December 31, 1998 and 1997
accumulated amortization of capitalized software development costs was $733,000
and $570,000, respectively.
j Sales and concentration of credit risks
For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, one customer a book
distributor contributed 139%, 144% and 152% of total revenues, respectively.
No other customer represented more than 10% of total revenues. On December 31,
1998 and 1997, this customer had a receivable balance of 119% and 103% of
total trade receivables, respectively.
The Company grants credit to customers in the ordinary course of business.
The majority of the Company customers are schools. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the significant number
of customers and their geographic dispersion.
k Stock-based compensation
The Company elected, as permitted by Statement of Accounting Standards No.
123 SFAS 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation to follow the
intrinsic value based method of accounting for stock options consistent with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25 Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees and to provide the pro forma disclosures of net income and
earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been applied. Under the
intrinsic method, compensation cost for stock options is measured by the excess,
if any, of the quoted price of the company stock at the measurement date over
the exercise price. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used to compute
the fair value of each option granted for purposes of the pro forma disclosures
required by SFAS 123.

ADVANTAGE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
l Earnings per common share
In February 1997 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS 128 Earnings Per Share.
This statement established new standards for computing and presenting earnings
per share which was adopted by the Company in 1997. SFAS 128 supercedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15 Earnings Per Share and purports to
simplify the standards for computing earnings per share and make such
computations comparable with international standards.
Basic earnings per common share Basic EPS has been computed based on
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per
common share Diluted EPS has been computed based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding, increased by the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common
shares had been issued. All share and per share data has been retroactively
adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend
effective February 26, 1999 see Note 13.
The weighted average shares outstanding for 1998, 1997 and 1996 are as
follows:
1998     1997     1996
Basic weighted average shares outstanding.  33,812,062  28,954,466  27,302,266
Dilutive effect of stock     163,998    93,210                                           Diluted weighted average shares outstanding.  33,976,060  29,047,676  27,302,266
m Comprehensive income
During 1997 the Financial Accounting Standards Board adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 SFAS 130 Reporting Comprehensive
Income. Effective for periods beginning after December 15, 1997, SFAS 130
establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and
its components. SFAS 130 requires that the total of other comprehensive income
for a period be transferred to a component of equity that is displayed
separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital. The Company
only component of comprehensive income, foreign currency translation
adjustments, is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
Statements of Consolidated and Combined Equity.
n Reclassifications
Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform with
the 1998 presentation.
5 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets, including goodwill, are amortized on the straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives. In connection with the acquisition of
Logicus, intangibles of $344,000 were acquired during 1998. Intangibles of
$1,548,000 were acquired during 1996 in connection with the acquisition of IPS.
Subsequently, in February 1997, the IPS purchase agreement was amended providing
for the release of the $15 million held in escrow and the issuance of $500,000
in Common Stock in settlement of the contingent consideration upon closing of
the Offering. This caused goodwill to increase by $415,177 $500,000 in stock
less $84,823 in interest related to the escrow funds.

6 INCOME TAXES
Prior to September 29, 1997, the shareholders of ALS and the Institute had
elected to have these companies treated as S corporations under the Internal
Revenue Code. As an S corporation, a company taxable income or loss is
included in the individual tax returns of its shareholders for Federal and state
income tax purposes. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any
provision or liability for current or deferred Federal or state income taxes
related to ALS or the Institute for any periods prior to September 29, 1997.
IPS was taxed as a C corporation under the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code and similar state tax laws from the time of its acquisition on
August 1, 1996 through December 31, 1996. Therefore, included in the 1996
combined financial statements is an income tax provision and related deferred
income taxes for IPS from the date of its acquisition until the end of 1996.
Subsequently, IPS elected to be taxed as an S corporation effective January 1,
1997. Consequently, the deferred tax asset recognized in 1996 was written off in
1997.
On September 29, 1997 the Company became subject to federal and state
income taxes as a C corporation. Consequently, the Company is now required to
account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 SFAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. In connection with
this change in the Company tax status, SFAS 109 required the Company to record
deferred taxes on the balance sheet for all book to tax basis differences
existing on the date of change to C corporation status. The financial statement
effect of recording the basis differences resulted in recognition of a deferred
tax asset and corresponding tax benefit of $35 million in 1997.

7 LINE OF CREDIT
The Company has obtained a $100 million unsecured revolving line of credit
with a bank which is available until March 31, 2000. The line of credit bears
interest at either a floating rate based on the prime rate less 10%, or a fixed
rate for a period of up to 90 days based on LIBOR plus 125%. The rate is at the
option of the Company and is determined at the time of borrowing. As of December
31, 1998 the line of credit had not been used.
8 LEASE COMMITMENTS
The Company is party to various operating leases for equipment and for the
IPS office facility. Rent expense for 1998, 1997 and 1996 was approximately

9 DEFINED CONTRIBUTION BENEFIT PLAN
The Company has a defined contribution benefit plan covering all of its
full-time employees meeting certain service requirements. The plan provides for
matching employer contributions based on 67% of employees' elective
contributions up to 6% of compensation. The plan allows employee contributions
of up to 15% of compensation. Discretionary employer contributions may also be
made to the plan. There were no discretionary contributions made in 1998, 1997
or 1996. Expense under the plan totaled approximately $370,000 in 1998, $297,000
in 1997 and $192,000 in 1996.
10 PHANTOM STOCK PLAN
As an incentive for certain key employees, ALS had a phantom stock plan. A
total of 585 phantom shares were issued prior to termination of the plan. Under
the terms of the plan, the completion of the Offering triggered a payout and
termination of the plan. Under the plan, each phantom share was paid an amount
equal to 001% of the market capitalization immediately after completion of the
Offering. This resulted in phantom stock plan termination expense of
approximately $16 million in the third quarter of 1997. Compensation expense of
approximately $21,000 was incurred in 1996 with respect to the plan.
11 STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Company has established the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan for its officers,
key employees, non-employee directors and consultants. A combined maximum of
3,000,000 options, SARs and share awards may be granted under the Plan. In
addition, not more than 1,500,000 shares may be subject to incentive stock
options. The exercise price of the stock options is market value of the common
stock at the date of grant.

Generally, the options vest and become exercisable ratably over a four-year
period, commencing one year after the grant date. The options expire 10 years
from the grant date.
Had compensation cost been determined for the Company stock option
portion of the Plan based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards
consistent with the alternative method set forth under SFAS 123, the Company
net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma

631%, and expected lives of 10 years for the options.
As of December 31, 1998, no SARs or share awards have been granted under
the plan. A summary of stock option activity under the plan for 1998 and 1997 is

12 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
Effective July 1, 1998, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
which allows employees to purchase shares of common stock through payroll
deductions, up to 10% of eligible compensation. The purchase price is equal to
85% of the fair market value of the common stock on either the first or last day
of the subscription period, whichever is lower. A total of 500,000 shares are
available for purchase under the plan. The Company has elected to apply
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, in accounting for its stock-based plans. Accordingly, the Company
will not recognize compensation expense for employee stock purchases. In January
1999, approximately 18,800 shares were issued to employees at $1185 with
respect to the 1998 plan.

13 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Company amended and restated articles of incorporation includes
authorization to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a $01 par
value and up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a $01 par value. No
preferred stock has been issued. On January 18, 1999, the board of directors of
the Company authorized a 2-for-1 split of common stock in the form of a stock
dividend payable on February 26, 1999 to shareholders of record on February 11,
1999. Accordingly, all share and per share data presented herein have been
restated to reflect this split.
In 1997 a 13331-for-1 stock split was effected in the form of two common
stock dividends which took place on March 28 and August 21, 1997. Also, in 1997,
640,266 common shares were issued in exchange for all of the outstanding shares
of the Institute and IPS. Accordingly, shares issued and outstanding on the face
of the balance sheet and all historical weighted average share and per share
amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split and the common stock
issued in exchange for the shares of the Institute and IPS.
The Company issued a total of 6,440,000 common shares during 1997 in a
public offering see Note 14. Additionally, 62,500 common shares were issued in
settlement of the purchase of IPS see Note 3. As of December 31, 1998,
3,000,000 common shares were reserved for issuance under the 1997 Stock
Incentive Plan see Note 11.
14 OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK
On September 30, 1997, the Company completed the Offering of 5,600,000
shares of common stock. As a result of this Offering, the Company received net
cash proceeds of $41,664,000 on the September 30, 1997 closing date. In
addition, the Company incurred approximately $941,000 in costs associated with
the Offering. This resulted in a net increase to shareholders' equity of
$40,723,000. Subsequently, on October 2, 1997, an additional 840,000 shares of
the Company common stock were sold pursuant to the exercise of an over-
allotment option granted in connection with the Offering. The Company received
additional net proceeds of $6,249,200 in connection with the exercise of this
over-allotment option all of which was accounted for as an increase to
shareholders' equity.
From September 1997 through December 31, 1998, the proceeds from the
Offering were used as follows:
- Approximately $16 million was used to pay compensation expenses related
to the termination of the Company phantom stock plan.
- Approximately $72 million was used to pay the entire principal and
accrued interest on the mortgage note and an unsecured note, both related
to the construction of the Company facility in Wisconsin Rapids,
Wisconsin.
- Approximately $51 million was used to pay the entire principal and
accrued interest on notes from the Company principal shareholders
related to the 1996 acquisition of IPS.
- Approximately $109 million was used to pay distributions of S
corporation retained profits to S corporation shareholders.

15 SEGMENT REPORTING
During 1997 the Financial Accounting Standards Board adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 SFAS 131 Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS 131 significantly changes the
disclosures required for the segments of a business but does not change income
measurement principles. The annual reporting requirements of SFAS 131 are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The adoption of
SFAS 131 did not have any impact on financial results of the Company.
The Company reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
different products and services. They are managed separately because each
business requires different technology and marketing strategies. The Company has
two reportable segments: software and training.
The software segment produces learning information system software for the
K-12 school market in the United States and Canada. The software assists
educators in assessing and monitoring student development by increasing the
quantity, quality, and timeliness of student performance data in the areas of
reading, math and writing. Revenue from the software segment includes product
revenue from the sale of software and service revenue from the sale of software
support agreements.
The training segment provides professional development training seminars.
The program trains educators how to accelerate learning in the classroom through
use of the information that the Company learning information systems provide.
The training program includes a variety of seminars presented in hotels and
schools across the country.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in Note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements. The Company evaluates the
performance of its operating segments based on operating income before
nonrecurring items. Intersegment sales and transfers and revenue derived outside
of the United States are not significant.
Summarized financial information concerning the Company reportable
segments is shown in the following table:

$475,000 purchased research and development in 1998; $16 million phantom
stock plan termination in 1997; and $34 million purchased research and

The information about the segments presented above is in compliance with
SFAS 131 reporting requirements. The reported measures are consistent with those
used in measuring amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Such
measurements are generally along legal entity lines as aggregated.
It is management opinion, however, that because many flows of value
between the reporting entities can not be precisely quantified, this information
provides an incomplete measure of the training segment profit or loss, and may
be subject to misinterpretation. The chief operating officer evaluates the
performance of the training segment based on many factors not captured by the
financial accounting system and often evaluates the company financial
performance on a total entity basis.
