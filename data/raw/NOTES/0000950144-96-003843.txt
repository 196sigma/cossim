ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
The financial statements and supplementary data are included in Part IV, Item
14 hereof. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Airways terminated its relationship with the independent public accounting firm
of Arthur Andersen LLP AA on September 28, 1995. AA report on Airways'
financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, did not contain
an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified
as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. From the time AA was
engaged by Airways through the date of AA dismissal, there were no
disagreements with AA on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which
disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of AA, would have caused it
to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with
its report.
Airways hired the independent public accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick
LLP KPMG for the purpose of conducting an audit for the next fiscal year.
