MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING Management of ADTRAN, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ADTRANs internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ADTRANs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
ADTRAN;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADTRAN are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADTRAN; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADTRANs assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of
ADTRANs internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that ADTRAN maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011. The effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To Board of Directors and Stockholders of ADTRAN, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ADTRAN, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report On Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ADTRAN issued 1,813 shares, 1,483 shares and 856 shares of treasury stock to accommodate employee stock option exercises
and vesting of restricted stock units during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2011 and 2010, ADTRAN received 7 shares and 4 shares, respectively, previously held by employees for at least six months as payment of the exercise price for
employee stock options. None of the transactions with respect to these shares were made in the open market. The average price paid per share with respect to these transactions was based on the closing price of the common stock on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market on the date of the transaction. There were no such transactions during 2009. The accompanying notes are an integral part of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Note 1 Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
ADTRAN, Inc. designs, manufactures and markets solutions and provides services and support for communications
networks. Our solutions are widely deployed by providers of communications services serviced by our Carrier Networks Division, and small and mid-sized enterprises SMEs serviced by our Enterprise Networks Division, and enable voice, data, video
and Internet communications across wireline and wireless networks. Many of these solutions are currently in use by every major United States and many global service providers, as well as by many public, private and governmental organizations
worldwide. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include ADTRAN and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market funds, and short-term investments classified as available-for-sale with original maturities of three months or less. We maintain
depository investments with certain financial institutions. Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these applicable financial institutions, and determined the
risk of material financial loss due to the exposure of such credit risk to be minimal. As of December31, 2011, $234 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were
in excess of government provided insured depository limits. Financial Instruments 
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable
approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for bonds payable was $470 million compared to an estimated fair value of $469 million, based on a debt security with a
comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard Poors credit rating of A. Investments with
maturities beyond one year, such as our municipal variable rate demand notes, may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations. At December31, 2011, 18% of our municipal variable rate demand notes had a credit rating of AAA, 58% had a credit rating of AA, 24% had a credit rating of A, and all contained put options of seven days. Despite the long-term nature
of their stated contractual maturities, we routinely buy and sell these securities and we believe that we have the ability to quickly liquidate them. Our investments in these securities are recorded at fair value, and the interest rates reset every
seven days. We believe we have the ability to sell our variable rate demand notes to the remarketing agent, tender agent, or issuer at par value plus accrued interest in the event we decide to liquidate our investment in a particular variable rate
demand note. At December31, 2011, approximately 34% of our variable rate demand notes were supported by letters of credit from banks that we believe to be in good financial condition. The remaining 66% of our variable rate demand notes were
supported by standby purchase agreements. As a result of these factors, we had no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains losses or gross realized gains losses from these investments at December31, 2011. All income generated from these
investments was recorded as interest income. We have not been required to record any losses relating to municipal variable rate demand notes. Long-term investments represent a restricted certificate of deposit, municipal fixed-rate bonds, corporate bonds, a fixed income bond fund, marketable equity securities, and other equity investments.
Marketable equity securities are reported at fair value as determined by the most recently traded price of the securities at the balance sheet date, although the securities may not be readily marketable due to the size of the available market.
Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method and are included in current income. We
periodically review our investment portfolio for investments considered to have sustained an other-than-temporary decline in value. Impairment charges for other-than-temporary declines in value are recorded as realized losses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. All of our investments at December31, 2011 and 2010 are classified as available-for-sale securities see Note 4. 
50 Table of Contents
Accounts Receivable We record accounts receivable at net realizable value. Prior to issuing payment terms to a new customer, we perform a detailed credit review of the customer. Credit limits are established for each new
customer based on the results of this credit review. Payment terms are established for each new customer, and collection experience is reviewed periodically in order to determine if the customers payment terms and credit limits need to be
revised. At December31, 2011, three customers, each of which accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable, accounted for 573% of our total accounts receivable in the aggregate. At December31, 2010, three customers, each of
which accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable, accounted for 547% of our total accounts receivable in the aggregate. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly review the allowance for doubtful accounts and consider
factors such as the age of accounts receivable balances, the current economic conditions that may affect a customers ability to pay, significant one-time events and our historical experience. If the financial condition of a customer
deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, we may be required to make additional allowances. If circumstances change with regard to individual receivable balances that have previously been determined to be
uncollectible and for which a specific reserve has been established, a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $8 thousand at December31, 2011 and $162 thousand at
December31, 2010. Other Receivables Other receivables are comprised primarily of amounts due from subcontract manufacturers for product component transfers, accrued interest on investments and on a restricted certificate of deposit and
amounts due from employee stock option exercises. Inventory Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead are used to value
inventory. Standard costs are updated at least quarterly; therefore, inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period. We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference
between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related write-downs are charged against the
inventory reserve. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment, which is stated at cost, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. We depreciate building and land improvements from five to 39 years, office machinery and equipment from three to seven years, engineering machinery and equipment from three to seven years and computer software from three
to five years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Betterments that materially prolong the lives of the assets are capitalized. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the gain or loss on such disposition is included in other income expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information. Liability for Warranty Our products generally include warranties of one to ten years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace
the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality
as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to systems products. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty
obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our
actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in
future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $41 million and $33 million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Balance at end of period 4,118 3,304 
Stock-Based Compensation We have two Board and stockholder approved stock option plans from which stock options and other awards are available for grant to employees and directors. All employee and director stock options granted
under our stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the award, as defined in the plan, of the underlying common stock on the grant date. There are currently no vesting provisions tied to performance or market
conditions for any option awards; vesting for all outstanding option grants is based only on continued service as an employee or director of ADTRAN. All of our outstanding stock option awards are classified as equity awards. 
Under the provisions of our approved plans, we made grants of performance-based restricted stock units to five of our executive officers
in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The restricted stock units are subject to a market condition based on the relative total shareholder return of ADTRAN against a peer group of companies 2009 grant or against all the companies in the NASDAQ
Telecommunications Index 2010 and 2011 grant and vest at the end of a three-year performance period. The restricted stock units are converted into shares of common stock upon vesting. Depending on the relative total shareholder return over the
performance period, the executive officers may earn from 0% to 150% of the number of restricted stock units granted. The fair value of the award is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected outcome
of the impact of market conditions using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method. The recipients of the restricted stock units also earn dividend credits during the performance period, which will be paid in cash upon the issuance of common stock
for the restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under the Stock Compensation Topic of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification FASB ASC in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $92 million, $77 million and $70 million, respectively. As of December31, 2011, total compensation cost related to
non-vested stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock not yet recognized was approximately $219 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 29 years. See Note 3 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
We review long-lived assets used in operations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the assets carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized in the amount by which the recorded value of the
asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, measured by the quoted market price of an asset or an estimate based on the best information available in the circumstances. There were no such impairment losses recognized during 2011, 2010 or 2009.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair
value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we
determine that the two-step quantitative test is necessary, then we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss is measured. There were no impairment losses during 2011. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is
computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which is 25 to seven years. Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs include compensation for engineers and support personnel, outside contracted services,
depreciation and material costs associated with new product development, the enhancement of current products, and product cost reductions. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development
efforts. Research and development costs totaled $1003 million, $903 million and $833 million for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of all changes in equity net assets during a period from non-owner sources. Items included in comprehensive income include net income, changes in unrealized gains and
losses on marketable securities, and foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income. The components of accumulated
comprehensive income loss are as follows:  September 30 September 30 September 30 In thousands

Income Taxes The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected
to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result
from the difference between financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more
likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Foreign Currency 
We record transactions denominated in foreign currencies on a monthly basis using exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar with any transaction gains or losses reported in income. Adjustments
from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Revenue Recognition Revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the
product to our customer in accordance with the title transfer terms of the sales agreement, generally FOB shipping point. In the case of consigned inventory, revenue is recognized when the end customer assumes ownership of the product. Contracts
that contain multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the units of accounting, and the revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each item requiring separate revenue recognition based on the relative selling price and corresponding terms
of the contract. We strive to use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price. When this evidence is not available, we are generally not able to determine third-party evidence of selling price because of the extent of customization among
competing products or services from other companies. We record revenue associated with installation services when all contractual obligations are complete. Contracts that include both installation services and product sales are evaluated for revenue
recognition in accordance with contract terms. As a result, depending on contract terms, installation services may be considered as a separate deliverable item or may be considered an element of the delivered product. Either the purchaser, ADTRAN,
or a third party can perform the installation of our products. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost is included in cost of sales. Revenue is recorded net of discounts. Also, revenue is recorded when the product price is fixed
or determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable, and product returns are reasonably estimable. Sales returns are accrued based on historical sales return experience, which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of future
returns.

A portion of Enterprise Networks products are sold to a non-exclusive distribution network
of major technology distributors in the United States. These large organizations then distribute to an extensive network of value-added resellers and system integrators. Value-added resellers and system integrators may be affiliated with us as a
channel partner, or they may purchase from the distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Additionally, with certain limitations our distributors may return unused and unopened product for stock-balancing purposes when such returns are accompanied by
offsetting orders for products of equal or greater value. We participate in cooperative advertising and market development
programs with certain customers. We use these programs to reimburse customers for certain forms of advertising, and in general, to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases. Our costs associated with these
programs are estimated and included in marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of income. We also participate in rebate programs to provide sales incentives for certain products. Our costs associated with these programs are estimated and
accrued at the time of sale, and are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue primarily represents customer billings on our maintenance service programs and deferred revenues
relating to multiple element contracts where we still have contractual obligations to our customers. We currently offer maintenance contracts ranging from one to five years, primarily on Enterprise Networks Division products sold through
distribution channels. Revenue attributable to maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over the related contract term. In addition, we provide software maintenance and a variety of hardware maintenance services to Carrier
Network Division customers under contracts with terms up to ten years. Non-current unearned revenue is included in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December31, 2011 and 2010, unearned revenue
was as follows:  September 30 September 30 In thousands
2011 2010 Current unearned revenue 9,965 10,138 Non-current unearned revenue 4,874 3,801 
Total 14,839 13,939 
Other Income Expense, Net Other income expense, net, is comprised primarily of miscellaneous income and expense, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, investment account management fees, and gains or losses on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment occurring in the normal course of business. Earnings per Share 
Earnings per common share, and earnings per common share assuming dilution, are based on the weighted average number of common shares
and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares outstanding during the year see Note 13. Dividends 
The Board of Directors presently anticipates that it will declare a regular quarterly dividend as long as the current tax treatment of
dividends exists and adequate levels of liquidity are maintained. During the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid $231 million, $225 million and $225 million, respectively, in dividend payments. On January17, 2012, the
Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $009 per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on February2, 2012. The ex-dividend date was January31, 2012 and the payment date was
February16, 2012. The quarterly dividend payment was $57 million. Business Combinations 
We use the acquisition method to account for business combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value on the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired. Costs incurred to complete the business combination, such as legal,
accounting or other professional fees, are charged to general and administrative expenses as they are incurred. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expense during the reporting period. Our more significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, allowance for sales returns, determination of
the deferred revenue components of multiple element sales agreements, estimated income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of
investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2011-05, Presentation of
Comprehensive Income ASU 2011-05. ASU 2011-05 requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to
present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. While ASU 2011-05 changes the presentation of comprehensive income, it does not change the components that are recognized in net
income or comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. This update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, ending after December15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt this amendment
during the first quarter of 2012. Since ASU 2011-05 affects presentation only, it will have no effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No2011-05 ASU 2011-12. ASU 2011-12 defers the effective date for certain presentation requirements that relate to reclassification adjustments and the effect of those reclassification
adjustments on the financial statements. This update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, ending after December15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt this amendment during the first quarter
of 2012. Since ASU 2011-12 affects presentation only, it will have no effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ASU 2011-04. ASU 2011-04
is intended to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The amendments are of two types: ithose that clarify the Boards intent
about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and iithose that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. This
update is effective for annual periods beginning after December15, 2011. We do not expect the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 
During 2011, we adopted the following accounting standards, which had no material effect on our consolidated results of operations or
financial condition: In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable
Revenue Arrangements ASU 2009-13. ASU 2009-13 provides amendments to the criteria in Subtopic 605-25 of the ASC for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements. As a result of those amendments, multiple-deliverable arrangements
are separated in more circumstances than under previously existing U.S. GAAP. ASU 2009-13 established a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and replaced the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance
with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity-specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant. ASU 2009 -13 also eliminated the residual method of allocation and required that arrangement
consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method and required that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to
determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. Wegenerally sell our products and services
separately, but in some circumstances products and services may be sold in bundles that contain multiple deliverables. A sale that includes multiple deliverables is evaluated to determine the units of accounting, and the revenue from the arrangement
is allocated to each item requiring separate revenue recognition based on the relative selling price and corresponding terms of the contract. We strive to use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price. When this evidence is not available,
we are generally not able to determine third-party evidence of selling price because of the extent of customization among competing products or services from other companies. In these cases, estimated selling price is determined based on the
particular circumstances of the arrangement and is used to allocate revenues to each unit of accounting. Revenue is recognized incrementally as the necessary criteria for each item are met. 
We adopted this amendment during the first quarter of 2011. The adoption of this amendment had no effect on our consolidated results of
operations and financial condition for the year ended December31, 2011. 
55 Table of Contents
In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2009-14, Certain
Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Arrangements. ASU 2009-14 changed the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements. Tangible products containing software components and non-software
components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in Subtopic 985-605 of the ASC. In addition, ASU 2009-14 requires that hardware
components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue guidance. In that regard, ASU 2009-14 provides additional guidance on how to determine which software, if any, relating to the tangible
product also would be excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance. ASU 2009-14 also provides guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that includes both tangible products and
software. ASU 2009-14 also provides further guidance on how to allocate arrangement consideration when an arrangement includes deliverables both included and excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance. We adopted this amendment during
the first quarter of 2011. The adoption of this amendment had no effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December31, 2011. 
In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment ASU 2011-08. Existing
accounting guidance requires that an entity perform a test for goodwill impairment, on at least an annual basis, by first comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount, then the second step of the test is to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. ASU 2011-08 will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to
perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that
its fair value is less than its carrying amount. This update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this amendment
during the fourth quarter of 2011. The adoption of this amendment had no effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December31, 2011. 
Note 2 Business Combinations 
On August4, 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Bluesocket, Inc., a provider of wireless network
solutions with virtual control, for $237 million in cash. The acquisition provides us with IEEE80211N enterprise class wireless LAN expertise, technology, and products to address the growing transition within small-medium enterprises and large
enterprises to wireless networks and mobile devices. We have included the financial results of Bluesocket in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations prior to the closing date for the
acquisition have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to our financial results. The allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition
date is as follows:  September 30 In Thousands Cash 1,027 Accounts receivable 298 Inventory 792 Prepaid expenses 357 Property, plant and equipment 173 Deferred tax assets, net 12,962 Accounts payable 441 Unearned revenue 600 Accrued expenses 332 
Net assets acquired 14,236 Customer relationships 1,530 Developed technology 3,230 Intellectual property 930 Trade names 270 Goodwill 3,492 
Total purchase price 23,688 
During the fourth quarter of 2011, the purchase price and purchase price allocation were adjusted for our
final valuations. The adjustments resulted in a decrease to the goodwill recognized in the transaction. The net deferred tax
assets acquired are primarily related to net operating losses and previously capitalized and unamortized research and development expense for tax deduction purposes. 
56 Table of Contents
The fair value of the customer relationships, developed technology and intellectual property
acquired was calculated using an income approach excess earnings method and is being amortized using the straight-line method. The customer relationships and intellectual property are being amortized over an estimated useful life of 7 years and
the developed technology is being amortized over an average estimated useful life of 45 years. The fair value of the trade
names acquired was calculated using an income approach relief from royalty method and is being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimate useful life of 45 years. 
The goodwill of $35 million generated from this acquisition is primarily related to expected synergies and was assigned to our
Enterprise Networks division. The goodwill will not be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For the year ended
December31, 2011, we incurred acquisition related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles of $17 million related to this acquisition. 
Note 3 Stock Incentive Plans 
Stock Incentive Program Descriptions Our Board of Directors adopted the 1996 Employee Incentive Stock Option Plan 1996 Plan effective February14, 1996, as amended, under which 170million shares of common stock were authorized
for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. Options granted under the 1996 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a
four or five-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, and have a ten-year contractual term. The 1996 Plan expired February14, 2006, and expiration dates of options outstanding at December31, 2011 under
the 1996 Plan range from 2012 to 2015. On January23, 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the 2006 Employee Stock
Incentive Plan 2006 Plan, which authorizes 130million shares of common stock for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and
restricted stock units. The 2006 Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders held on May9, 2006. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued
employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of options outstanding at December31, 2011 under the 2006 Plan range
from 2016 to 2021. Our stockholders approved the 2010 Directors Stock Plan 2010 Directors Plan on May5, 2010, under
which 05million shares of common stock have been reserved.This plan replaces the 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan.The 2010 Directors Plan provides that the Company may issue stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock
units to our non-employee directors.Stock awards issued under the 2010 Directors Plan normally become vested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date.Options issued under the 2010 Directors Plan have a ten-year contractual
term.We currently also have options outstanding under the 1995 Directors Plan, as amended, and the 2005 Directors Plan.Expiration dates of options outstanding under both plans at December31, 2011 range from 2012 to 2020.

All of the options above were issued at exercise prices that approximate fair market value at the date of
grant. At December31, 2011, 80million options were available for grant under the shareholder approved plans. The
aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value the difference between ADTRANs closing stock price on the last trading day of 2011 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money
options that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December31, 2011. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of ADTRANs stock.
The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $398 million, $203 million and $53
million, respectively. The fair value of options fully vesting during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $73 million, $69 million and $71 million, respectively. Restricted Stock Program Description On November6, 2008, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the Performance Shares Agreement under the 2006 Plan which sets forth the terms and conditions of awards of performance-based restricted stock units RSUs. Of the 130million shares of
common stock authorized for issuance under the 2006 Plan, we may grant up to 50million shares of common stock for issuance to certain employees and officers for awards other than stock options, which would include RSUs. Under a proposal that
was approved by the Board of Directors and shareholders at the 2010 annual meeting, the number of shares available for awards other than stock options under all stock plans was reduced to 33 million. The number of shares of common stock earned by a
recipient pursuant to the RSUs is subject to a market condition based on ADTRANs relative total shareholder return against a peer group 2009 grant or against all companies in the NASDAQ Telecommunications Index 2010 and 2011 grant at the
end of a three-year performance period. Depending on the relative total shareholder return over the performance period, the recipient may earn from 0% to 150% of the shares underlying the RSUs, with the shares earned distributed upon the vesting of
the RSUs at the end of the three-year performance period. The fair value of the award is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected outcome of the impact of market conditions using a Monte Carlo
Simulation valuation method. A portion of the granted RSUs also vest and the underlying shares become deliverable upon the death or disability of the recipient or upon a change of control of ADTRAN, as defined by the 2006 Plan. The recipients of the
RSUs receive dividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs. The dividend credits are vested and earned in the same manner as the RSUs and will be paid in cash upon the issuance of common stock for the RSUs. 
The following table is a summary of our RSUs and restricted stock outstanding as of December31, 2010 and 2011 and the changes that

As of December31, 2011, there was approximately $22 million of total unamortized compensation cost
related to the non-vested portion of RSUs and restricted stock granted, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the three-year performance period for RSUs and over the remainder of the one-year vesting period for
restricted stock. 
58 Table of Contents
Valuation and Expense Information 
We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model Black-Scholes Model for the purpose of determining the estimated fair value of stock
option awards on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes Model requires the input of certain assumptions that involve judgment. Because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in
the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, existing models may not provide reliable measures of fair value of our stock options. We use a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method to value our performance-based RSUs. The fair
value of restricted stock issued is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. We will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation. If circumstances
change, and additional data becomes available over time, we may change our assumptions and methodologies, which may materially impact our fair value determination. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, RSUs and restricted stock under the Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC for the years ended December31,
2011, 2010 and 2009, which was recognized as follows:  September 30 September 30 September 30 In thousands
2011 2010 2009 Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of sales 412 317 268 
Selling, general and administrative expense 4,316 3,575 3,039 Research and development expense 4,441 3,825 3,680 
Stock-based compensation expense included in operating expenses 8,757 7,400 6,719 
Total stock-based compensation expense 9,169 7,717 6,987 Tax benefit for expense associated with non-qualified options 1,321 650 634 
Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax 7,848 7,067 6,353 
At December31, 2011, total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, RSUs and
restricted stock not yet recognized was approximately $219 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 29 years. The stock option pricing model requires the use of several significant assumptions that impact the fair value estimate. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price
and employee exercise behaviors. The assumptions and variables used for the current period grants were developed based on guidance in the Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC. There were no material changes made during 2011 to the methodology
used to determine our assumptions. The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted to employees and
directors during the twelve months ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $953 per share, $1169 per share and $811 per share, respectively, with the following weighted-average assumptions: September 30 September 30 September 30 2011 2010 2009 Expected volatility 3832 3957 4186 Risk-free interest rate 101 135 229 Expected dividend yield 119 108 155 Expected life in years 515 578 510
We based our estimate of expected volatility for the 12 months ended December31, 2011, 2010 and
2009 on the sequential historical daily trading data of our common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the options granted. The selection of the historical volatility method was based on available data indicating our historical
volatility is as equally representative of our future stock price trends as is our implied volatility. We have no reason to believe the future volatility of our stock price is likely to differ from its past volatility. 
The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon implied yields of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds on the date of grant having a
remaining term equal to the expected life of the options granted. The dividend yield is based on our historical and expected dividend payouts. The expected life of our stock options is based upon historical exercise and cancellation activity of our previous stock-based grants with a ten-year contractual term. 
59 Table of Contents
The RSU pricing model also requires the use of several significant assumptions that impact
the fair value estimate. The estimated fair value of the RSUs granted to employees in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $3873 per share, $3921 per share and $2665 per share, respectively, with the following assumptions: September 30 September 30 September 30 2011 2010 2009 Expected volatility 3932 4082 4141 Risk-free interest rate 037 051 140 Expected dividend yield 108 107 153 Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the 12 months
ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is based on RSUs and options ultimately expected to vest, and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Estimates for forfeiture rates are based upon historical experience and are evaluated quarterly. We
expect our forfeiture rate for stock option awards to be approximately 16% annually. We estimated a 0% forfeiture rate for our RSUs and restricted stock due to the limited number of recipients and historical experience for these awards.

million, respectively, of corporate bonds. These bonds are classified as available-for-sale and had an average duration of 08 years at December31, 2011. At December31, 2011, approximately 1% of our corporate bond portfolio had a credit
rating of AAA, 11% had a credit rating of AA, 50% had a credit rating of A, and 38% had a credit rating of BBB.

At December31, 2011 and 2010, we held $1748 million and $715 million, respectively,
of municipal fixed-rate bonds. These bonds are classified as available-for-sale investments and had an average duration of 13 years at December31, 2011. At December31, 2011, approximately 19% of our municipal fixed-rate bond portfolio
had a credit rating of AAA, 64% had a credit rating of AA, 15% had a credit rating of A, and 2% had a credit rating of BBB. Because our bond portfolio has a high quality rating and contractual maturities of a short duration, we are able to obtain
prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market, on a daily basis. As of
December31, 2011, corporate and municipal fixed-rate bonds had the following contractual maturities:  September 30 September 30 In thousands

At December31, 2011 and 2010, we held $697 million and $1167 million, respectively, of municipal
variable rate demand notes, all of which were classified as available-for-sale short-term investments. At December31, 2011, 18% of our municipal variable rate demand notes had a credit rating of AAA, 58% had a credit rating of AA, 24% had a
credit rating of A, and all contained put options of seven days. Despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, we routinely buy and sell these securities and we believe that we have the ability to quickly liquidate them. Our
investments in these securities are recorded at fair value, and the interest rates reset every seven days. We believe we have the ability to sell our variable rate demand notes to the remarketing agent, tender agent or issuer at par value plus
accrued interest in the event we decide to liquidate our investment in a particular variable rate demand note. At December31, 2011, approximately 34% of our variable rate demand notes were supported by letters of credit from banks that we
believe to be in good financial condition. The remaining 66% of our variable rate demand notes were supported by standby purchase agreements. As a result of these factors, we had no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains losses or gross
realized gains losses from these investments. All income generated from these investments was recorded as interest income. We have not been required to record any losses relating to municipal variable rate demand notes. 
At December31, 2011 and 2010, we held $07 million of a fixed income bond fund. This bond fund had unrealized gains of $02 million
at December31, 2011 and 2010. At December31, 2011, we held $313 million of marketable equity securities,
including a single security, of which we held 11million shares, carried at a fair value of $173 million. We sold 05million shares of this security during the 12 months ended December31, 2011. The sales resulted in proceeds of
$92 million and a realized gain of $91 million. This single security traded approximately 08million shares per day in 2011, in an active market on a European stock exchange. This single security comprises $169 million of the gross
unrealized gains included in the fair value of our marketable equity securities at December31, 2011. The remaining $22 million of gross unrealized gains and $06 million of gross unrealized losses at December31, 2011 were spread amongst
more than 400 equity securities. At December31, 2010, we held $480 million of marketable equity securities, including the single security mentioned above, of which we held 15million shares, carried at a fair value of $342 million.
This single security comprised $337 million of the gross unrealized gains included in the fair value of our marketable equity securities at December31, 2010. The remaining $30 million of unrealized gains and $01 million of gross unrealized
losses at December31, 2010 were spread amongst more than 415 equity securities. At December31, 2011 and 2010, we
held a $483 million restricted certificate of deposit, which is carried at cost. This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development
Authority revenue bond the Bond. At December31, 2011, the estimated fair value of the Bond was approximately $469 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard Poors credit
rating of A. We have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. For more information on the Bond, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December31, 2011 and 2010, we held $21 million of other investments carried at cost, consisting of interests in two
private equity funds and an investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer. The fair value of these investments was estimated to be approximately $100 million at December31, 2011, based on unobservable inputs
including information supplied by the company and the fund managers. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $79 million in the two private equity funds, and we have contributed $84 million as of December31, 2011, of which $77
million has been applied toward these commitments. As of December31, 2011 we have received distributions related to these two private equity funds of $88 million, of which $22 million was recorded as investment income. These investments are
carried at cost, net of distributions, with distributions in excess of our investment recorded as investment income. The duration of each of these commitments is ten years with $01 million expiring in 2013 and $01 million expiring in 2012. We have
not been required to record any impairment losses related to these investments during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration, which limits, at the
time of purchase, the concentration in any one issuer to 5% of the market value of our total investment portfolio. We review
our investment portfolio for potential other-than-temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if
necessary, recognize and record the appropriate charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following:
the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary
impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% or more for six or more consecutive months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors
to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. As a result of our review, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $36 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2011. For each of the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
we recorded a charge of $68 thousand, $43 thousand and $29 million, respectively, related to the other-than-temporary impairment of certain marketable equity securities, a fixed income bond fund and deferred compensation plan assets.

The increase in unrealized losses during 2011, as reflected in the table above, is primarily due to
credit yield spreads widening during the second half of 2011 primarily impacting our corporate bonds. At December31, 2011, a total of 128 of our marketable equity securities were in an unrealized loss position. 
In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, we have categorized our cash equivalents held in
money market funds and our investments held at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows: Level 1Values based on
unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market; Level 2Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; Level 3Values based
on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs include information supplied by investees.

As of December31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the investments in available-for-sale Level 2
corporate bonds and municipal fixed-rate bonds was $3316 million and $1985 million, respectively. The fair value of these securities is calculated using a weighted average market price for each security. Market prices are obtained from a variety
of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple market prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market
value of each security. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the investments in available-for-sale Level
2 municipal variable rate demand notes was $697 million and $1167 million, respectively. These securities have a structure that implies a standard expected market price. The frequent interest rate resets make it reasonable to expect the price to
stay at par. These securities are priced at the expected market price.

Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
The changes in the carrying value of goodwill, all of which is included in our Enterprise Networks division, for the

Total goodwill 3,492 
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual
evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit
to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss is measured. There were no impairment
losses during 2011.

Note 8 Alabama State Industrial Development Authority Financing and Economic Incentives 
In conjunction with an expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama, facility, we were approved for participation in an
incentive program offered by the State of Alabama Industrial Development Authority the Authority. Pursuant to the program, on January13, 1995, the Authority issued $200 million of its taxable revenue bonds and loaned the
proceeds from the sale of the bonds to ADTRAN. The bonds were originally purchased by AmSouth Bank of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama the Bank. Wachovia Bank, N.A., Nashville, Tennessee formerly First Union National Bank of Tennessee
the Bondholder, which was acquired by Wells Fargo Company on December31, 2008, purchased the original bonds from the Bank and made further advances to the Authority, bringing the total amount outstanding to $500
million. An Amended and Restated Taxable Revenue Bond Amended and Restated Bond was issued and the original financing agreement was amended. The Amended and Restated Bond bears interest, payable monthly. The interest rate is
5%per annum. The Amended and Restated Bond matures on January1, 2020. The estimated fair value of the bond at December31, 2011 was approximately $469 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity
and a Standard Poors credit rating of A. We are required to make payments to the Authority in amounts necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the Amended and Restated Bond. Included in long-term investments at
December31, 2011 is $483 million which is invested in a restricted certificate of deposit. These funds serve as a collateral deposit against the principal of this bond, and we have the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the
collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings that we are
required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under the program. For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we realized economic incentives related to payroll withholdings totaling $19 million, $15
million and $15 million, respectively. Due to continued positive cash flow from operating activities, we made a business
decision in 2006 to begin an early partial redemption of the Bond. We made principal payments of $10 million and $03 million for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. It is our intent to make annual principal payments in
addition to the interest amounts that are due. In connection with this decision, $05 million of the bond debt has been reclassified to a current liability in accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2011 and 2010.

At December31, 2011 and 2010, non-current deferred tax liabilities and non-current deferred tax
assets, respectively, related to investments reflect deferred taxes on unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these investments, a deferred tax benefit of $78
million in 2011 and a deferred tax provision of $46 million in 2010, is recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income, presented in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income. 
66 Table of Contents
We have deferred tax assets for both foreign and domestic loss, unamortized research and
development cost and state credit carry-forwards of $227 million which will expire between 2012 and 2030. These carry-forwards were caused by tax credits in excess of our annual tax liabilities to an individual state where we no longer generate
sufficient state income, net operating loss carry-forwards acquired through the acquisition of a foreign entity and net operating losses and research and development cost acquired through the acquisition of a domestic entity. In accordance with the
Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC, we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize the full benefits of the deferred tax asset arising from these losses and credits, and accordingly, have provided a valuation allowance against these
assets. We do not provide for U.S. income tax on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations, whose earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested. For years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, foreign profits before income taxes
were not material. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $105 million, $49 million and $15
million, respectively, as an adjustment to equity in accordance with the Stock Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC. This deduction is calculated on the difference between the exercise price of stock option exercises and the market price of the
underlying common stock upon exercise. The change in the unrecognized income tax benefits for 2011, 2010 and 2009 is reconciled below:

Balance at end of period 2,970 2,593 2,919 
As of December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $30
million, $26 million, and $29 million, respectively, of which $24 million, $20 million, and $23 million, respectively, would reduce our effective tax rate if we were successful in upholding all of the uncertain positions and recognized the
amounts recorded. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the balances of accrued interest and penalties were $12 million, $10
million and $12 million, respectively. We do not anticipate a single tax position generating a significant increase or
decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this reporting date. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions and several foreign jurisdictions. We have been audited by the Internal
Revenue Service and the state of Alabama through the 2007 tax year. Generally, we are not subject to changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years prior to 2008. 
Note 10 Employee Benefit Plans 
401k Savings Plan We maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. 401k Retirement Plan Savings Plan for the benefit of our eligible employees. The Savings Plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401a and 401k of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Code, and is intended to be a safe harbor 401k plan under Code Section401k12. The Savings Plan allows employees to save for retirement by contributing part of their compensation to the plan
on a tax-deferred basis. The Savings Plan also requires us to contribute a safe harbor amount each year. We match up to 4% of employee contributions 100% of an employees first 3% of contributions and 50% of their next 2% of
contributions, beginning on the employees one year anniversary date. In calculating our matching contribution, we only use compensation up to the statutory maximum under the Code $245 thousand for 2011. All contributions under the Savings
Plan are 100% vested. Expenses recorded for employer contributions and plan administration costs for the Savings Plan amounted to approximately $43 million, $46 million and $42 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Deferred Compensation Plans We maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan Deferred Compensation Plan. This plan is offered as a supplement to our tax-qualified 401k plan and is available to certain executive management
employees who have been designated by our Board of Directors. The deferred compensation plan allows participants to defer all or a portion of certain specified bonuses and up to 25% of remaining cash compensation, and permits us to make matching
contributions on a discretionary basis, without the limitations that apply to the 401k plan. To date, we have not made any matching contributions under this plan. 
67 Table of Contents
We also maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Equity Deferral Program for Employees for the purpose of
providing deferred compensation for certain executive management employees. Participants may elect to defer all or a portion of their vested Performance Share awards to the Plan. Such deferrals shall continue to be held and deemed to be invested in
shares of ADTRAN stock unless and until the amounts are distributed or such deferrals are moved to another deemed investment pursuant to an election made by the Participant. We have set aside the plan assets for both plans in a rabbi trust Trust and all contributions are credited to bookkeeping accounts for the participants. The Trust assets are subject to the claims of our
creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The assets of the Trust are deemed to be invested in pre-approved mutual funds as directed by each participant, and the participants bookkeeping account is credited with the earnings and
losses attributable to those investments. Benefits are scheduled to be distributed six months after termination of employment in a single lump sum payment or annual installments paid over a three or ten year term. Distributions will be made on a pro
rata basis from each of the hypothetical investments of the Participants account in cash. Any whole shares of ADTRAN, Inc. common stock that are distributed will be distributed in-kind. 
Assets of the Trust are deemed invested in mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum ranging from equities to money market
instruments. These mutual funds are publicly quoted and reported at fair value. The fair value of the assets held by the Trust and the amounts payable to the plan participants are as follows: September 30 September 30 In thousands
