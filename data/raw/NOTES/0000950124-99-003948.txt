INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
TALX Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TALX
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1998 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 1999. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TALX
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended March 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Description of Business
TALX Corporation TALX or the Company provides interactive Web,
interactive voice response IVR, computer telephony integration CTI
software and services to large organizations such as Fortune 500 companies and
federal government agencies. The Company software and services enable an
organization employees, customers, vendors and business partners Users to
access, input and update information without human assistance. The Company
software and services enhance service levels, improve productivity and reduce
costs by enabling Users to perform self-service transactions. Historically, the
Company has designed and implemented tailored systems that provide an
organization Users with access to databases of information relating to that
organization.
The Work Number NumberR is a national service providing automated access
to information from multiple organizations. The Work Number provides automated
responses to requests by mortgage lenders or other verifiers for confirmation of
employment information about a participating employer current and former
employees.
Tailored software and services are offered by TALX to its customers either
installed on customers' premises or on an outsourced services basis. The Company
has provided tailored software and services installed at customers' premises
since the early 1980s. In 1993, the Company introduced its outsourced services
business which allows a client to realize the benefits of the Company software
and services without incurring the administrative or maintenance
responsibilities of operating such a system. For outsourced services customers,
the Company maintains the client database on a system at the Company
facilities, where incoming requests for access to the information are received.
In addition to providing software and services described above, the Company
has historically provided database and document services. Database services
include providing sales leads and prepress services for directory publishers.
Document services include the preparation and mailing of invoices, statements,
and confirmation letters for organizations with high-volume requirements. See
Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
b Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TALX
Corporation and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
d Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost average or market.
Inventories consist primarily of hardware and spare parts.
e Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is computed using straight-line and accelerated
methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
34
35
TALX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
MARCH 31, 1999 AND 1998
Amortization of leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases
is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the useful life of
the asset or lease term.
f Product Development and Capitalized Software Development Costs
Product development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Software
development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is
achieved, after which they are capitalized on a product-by-product basis.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is the greater of the
amount computed using i the ratio that current gross revenues for a product
bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that
product or ii the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic
life of the product. Amortization of capitalized software development costs
starts when the product is available for general release to customers.
g Revenue Recognition, Work in Progress and Progress Billings
Revenues from The Work Number are recognized from fees charged to Users for
verifications of employment history and salary and from employer conversion and
maintenance fees. Prior to April 1, 1998, customer premises systems revenue was
generally recognized upon shipment of the system. For all transactions entered
into subsequent to April 1, 1998, the Company has adopted the American Institute
of CPA Statement of Position 97-2 SOP 97-2. Under SOP 97-2, the Company
recognizes hardware and software license revenue upon shipment. Revenues for
customization services are recognized by the contract method of accounting using
percentage of completion for larger, more complex systems and the completed
contract method for smaller systems. Outsourced services revenue is recognized
as the services are provided. Revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and
recognized ratably over the maintenance period. Deferred maintenance revenue
represents the unearned portion of maintenance fees.
h Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company sells its software and services in a variety of industries. One
customer represented approximately 12% of revenues in fiscal 1997. No customer
represented over 10% of revenues in fiscal 1998 or 1999. The Company performs
periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally
does not require collateral; however, it maintains a security interest in
hardware until payment is received. Credit losses from customers have been
within management expectations, and management believes the allowance for
doubtful accounts adequately provides for any expected losses.
i Income Taxes
The Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
j Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company discloses estimated fair values for its financial instruments.
A financial instrument is defined as cash or a contract that both imposes on one
entity a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another
35
36
TALX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
MARCH 31, 1999 AND 1998
financial instrument to a second entity and conveys to that second entity a
contractual right to receive cash or another financial instrument from the first
entity.
k Stock Option Plans
The Company records stock-based compensation over the vesting period for
the difference between the quoted market price of an award at the date of grant
and the exercise price of the option, if any. The Company provides pro forma net
income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option
grants made in 1995 and later years as if the fair-value-based method had been
applied.
l Management Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
m Net Earnings Loss Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects
the incremental increase in common shares outstanding assuming the exercise of
all employee stock options and warrants that would have had a dilutive effect on
earnings per share. For all years presented, basic and diluted earnings per
share are the same. Earnings loss per share has been computed using the number
of shares of common stock and common stock options and warrants outstanding,
assuming conversion of all outstanding preferred stock to 751,111 shares of
common stock. The weighted average number of shares is based on common stock
outstanding for basic earnings loss per share and common stock outstanding and
common stock options and warrants for diluted earnings loss per share in
periods when such common stock options and warrants are not antidilutive.
2 RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
During the quarter ended December 31, 1998, the Company reorganized its
sales and delivery operations and refocused its product line, related to its
customer premises systems line of business. In conjunction with the
reorganization, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately 8% and closed
certain regional sales offices. As a result of these actions, the Company
incurred restructuring charges of $318,000 related to employee severance costs
and $178,000 of other costs. These items are reflected in the line item
restructuring charge on the statement of operations and $159,000 is reflected
in accrued expenses on the balance sheet at March 31, 1999.
3 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In August 1996, the Company determined to pursue the divestiture of the
database and document services businesses and, accordingly, has reflected the
results of operations of such businesses as discontinued operations. A provision
of $350,000 was made as of June 30, 1996 to reflect the anticipated loss from
operations until the time of disposal. On January 31, 1997, the Company sold
substantially all of the assets of the document services business to Sterling
Direct, Inc., the largest customer of the division. The sales price, after
giving effect to the post-closing adjustments, was $1,241,000. Of the amount 200,000 is in the form of an 8%, three-year subordinated note and the remainder
was paid in cash. The net assets related to this sale were approximately
$566,000. As of March 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company provided additional
provisions
36
37
TALX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
MARCH 31, 1999 AND 1998
for loss, net of tax, in the amount of $550,000 and $374,000, respectively. No
additional provision for loss was necessary as of March 31, 1999. The Company
anticipates disposition of the remaining operations through sale during fiscal
2000.
The Company has classified the database business as a discontinued
operation and has reclassified the prior period statements of operations to
reflect this change.
Summary balance sheet data as of March 31, 1999 and 1998 is as follows                                  MARCH 31,

8 FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
In June 1996, the Company entered into a loan agreement to secure
additional debt of $4,000,000, through a subordinated note payable, $3,350,000
of which was funded as of June 30, 1996 and $650,000 of which was funded August
15, 1996. The loan, which was due and payable on July 1, 2001, bore interest at
1325% with an effective interest rate of 1925% and required the granting of
a security interest in the Company tangible and intangible assets. In
connection with this loan, the Company issued warrants for 138,142 shares of
common stock, exercisable at $01 per share, for which $879,000 of value was
ascribed.
The Company used a portion of the net proceeds of its initial public
offering to repay the amounts outstanding under its various financing
arrangements. The repayment of the subordinated note payable resulted in an
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1,180,000 and a related
tax benefit of $209,000.
The Company has a $5,000,000 line of credit facility with a commercial
bank. Outstanding borrowings, if any, will bear interest at LIBOR plus 225% and
are secured by accounts receivable and inventory. During the fiscal year ended
March 31, 1999, the average outstanding borrowings under this facility were
$604,000, with a maximum balance outstanding of $21 million.
9 LEASES
The Company has noncancellable operating leases, primarily for office space
and office equipment, that expire through 2004 and provide for purchase or
renewal options.
Total rent expense for operating leases, including contingent rentals, was
$932,000, $708,000, and $578,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases as of
March 31, 1999 are as follows                                IN THOUSANDS

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Certain net operating
loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income of TALX. In
order to fully realize the deferred tax assets, TALX will need to generate
future taxable income of approximately $3,400,000 prior to the expiration of the
net operating loss carryforwards in 2013. Taxable income loss of TALX for the
years ended March 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 was $425,000, $3,294,000 and
$608,000, respectively. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and
projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax
assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the
Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
At March 31, 1999, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of $6,062,000, which are available to offset future
federal taxable income, if any, through 2013. In addition, the Company has
alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $22,000 and
general business credit carryforwards of approximately $53,000, which are
available to reduce future federal regular income taxes, if any, over an
indefinite period.

TALX has adopted two incentive stock option plans for employees which

TALX has adopted a stock option plan for outside directors which provides
for the issuance of a maximum of 80,000 shares of common stock. Options are
granted in the amount of 1,500 shares each to outside directors at prices not
less than fair market value as of the date of the grant, which is April 1 of
each year. The options vest one year from the date of grant. Options outstanding
amount to 6,000 and 12,000 at March 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for the stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the
grant date for awards in fiscal 1997 and 1998 consistent with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123, the Company net earnings loss and net earnings loss per
share would have been impacted by an immaterial amount less than $01 per
share in each year. The effect for fiscal 1999 would be to reduce net earnings
by $235,000 or $04 per share, based on the weighted average fair value of
options granted of $310 per option.

MARCH 31, 1999 AND 1998
The Company made calculations under SFAS No. 123 reflecting only options
granted in fiscal 1997, 1998 and 1999. Therefore, the full impact of calculating
compensation cost for stock options under SFAS No. 123 was not reflected in the
determination of the impact, because compensation cost is reflected over the
options' vesting period of six to 10 years and compensation cost for options
granted prior to April 1, 1995 is not considered. The fair value of option
grants for fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: expected volatility of 65%, 85% and 65% in fiscal 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively; risk-free interest rate of 500%, 619% and 644% in fiscal
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively; expected life of 45 years for 1999, and six
years for 1998 and 1997; and an expected dividend yield of 00% in all periods.                       OPTIONS OUTSTANDING          OPTIONS EXERCISABLE

During fiscal 1997, shareholders approved the TALX Corporation 1996
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees the
right to purchase common stock on a quarterly basis at the lower of 85% of the
market price at the beginning or end of each three-month offering period. As of
March 31, 1999, there were 200,000 shares of common stock reserved for the ESPP
with 61,254, 34,901 and 3,285 shares issued in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
12 DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts for the Company cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, trade receivables, income tax refund receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the
short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of notes payable
to bank, long-term debt, and capital lease obligations approximate fair value
because the interest rates vary with or approximate market rates.
13 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
The Company sponsors a profit-sharing/401k plan. The plan covers
substantially all of the Company employees. The Company makes contributions to
the plan, subject to ERISA limitations, up to 2% of employees' earnings. Total
expense under the plan for the years ended March 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 was
$197,000, $146,000, and $100,000, respectively.
14 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in certain litigation matters arising in the normal
course of business. In the opinion of Company management, these matters will not
