Penn National Gaming,Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    
1.Business and Basis of Presentation 
Penn National Gaming,Inc. Penn and subsidiaries collectively, the Company is a diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and operator of gaming and
pari-mutuel properties. Penn is the successor to several businesses that have operated as Penn National Race Course since 1972. Penn was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982 as PNRC Corp.
and adopted its current name in 1994, when the Company became a public company. In 1997, the Company began its transition from a pari-mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with
the acquisition of the Charles Town property and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. From 2000 to 2003, the Company acquired seven other gaming properties through its
Mississippi Casino Magic-Bay St. Louis and Boomtown Biloxi, CRC Holdings,Inc. Casino Rouge and Casino Rama management service contract, Bullwhackers properties and Hollywood
Casino Corporation Aurora and Tunica acquisitions. On October3, 2005, the Company acquired Argosy Gaming Company Argosy, which included seven properties, of which one has been divested. The
Company now owns or operates, through its subsidiaries, fourteen gaming properties located in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Ontario and
West Virginia that are focused primarily on serving customers within driving distance of the properties. The Company also owns or operates one racetrack and six off-track wagering OTW
facilities in Pennsylvania, one racetrack in each of West Virginia, Maine, and Ohio, and, through a joint venture, own 50% of a racetrack in New Jersey. 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
For
purposes of comparability, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
2.Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Penn and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Investment in and advances to an unconsolidated affiliate
that is 50% owned is accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
3.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all cash balances and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. 
The
Company policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution, and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being creditworthy, or in
short-term 
64  money
market and tax-free bond funds which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risk. The Company has bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements that exceed federally-
insured limits. 
Concentration
of credit risk, with respect to casino receivables, is limited through the Company credit evaluation process. The Company issues markers to approved casino customers only
following background checks and investigations of creditworthiness. 
The
Company receivables of $476million primarily consist of $162million due from the West Virginia Lottery for gaming revenue settlements at Charles Town and
$136million for reimbursement of expenses paid on behalf of Casino Rama as of December31, 2005. Accounts
are written off when management determines that an account is uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An allowance for doubtful
accounts is determined to reduce the Company receivables to their carrying value, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on historical collection experience, specific review
of individual customer accounts, and current economic and business conditions. Historically, the Company has not incurred any significant credit-related losses. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate: Cash
and Cash Equivalents: The carrying amount approximates the fair value, due to the short maturity of the cash equivalents. 
Long-term
Debt: The fair value of the Company senior secured credit facility approximates its carrying value, as it is variable-rate debt. The fair value of the Company
fixed-rate bonds is $6334million, and the carrying value is $6252million, and is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current
rates
offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of the Company capital leases approximates carrying value. Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repairs that neither add materially to the value of the asset nor
appreciably prolong its useful life are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment are included in the determination of income. Depreciation
of property and equipment and amortization of leasehold improvements are provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Land improvements
5 to 15 years Building and improvements
25 to 40 years Furniture, fixtures, and equipment
3 to 7 years Transportation equipment
5 years Leasehold improvements
10 to 20 years The
Company reviews the carrying values of its property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future operating cash flows. As of December31, 2005, the Company has recognized an impairment charge of $43million associated
with the Penn National Race Course building demolition. 
65  Goodwill 
Goodwill is recorded as part of the Company acquisitions of businesses where the purchase price exceeds the fair market value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets. The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS142, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB. SFAS142 establishes standards for the accounting of intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a
group of other assets and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. In accordance with SFAS No142,
amortization of goodwill is not required. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the
goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The Company has determined that the gaming and racing reportable segments, as defined by SFAS No131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS131, are its two reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. See Note15: Segment Information for further
information about the Company reportable segments. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, no impairment charges were required as a result of the annual impairment test. Other Intangible Assets 
The Company accounts for its other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS142. In accordance with SFAS142, the Company considers its gaming
license and trademark intangible assets as indefinite useful life intangibles that do not require amortization. Rather, these intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing
the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amounts of the gaming license and trademark intangible assets exceed their fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.
The Company has determined that the gaming and racing reportable segments, as defined by SFAS131, are its two reporting units for purposes of testing the gaming license and trademark
intangible assets for impairment. The customer relationship and computer software intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which
are five and three years, respectively. The management service contract for Casino Rama is amortized using the straight-line method through July2011, the expiration date of the
contract. 
Deferred Financing Costs 
Deferred financing costs that are incurred by the Company in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of
the underlying indebtedness using the straight-line method, adjusted to reflect any early repayments. Comprehensive Income 
The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS130, which established
standards for the reporting and presentation of comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements. The Company presents comprehensive income in its consolidated statements of changes in
shareholders' equity. 
Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS109. Under SFAS109, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the
prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized. SFAS109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a 
66  valuation
allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
Effective January1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS133,
which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. 
The
Company uses fixed and variable-rate debt to finance its operations. Variable-rate debt obligations expose the Company to variability in interest payments due
to changes in interest rates. The Company continuously monitors changes in interest rate exposures and evaluates hedging opportunities. The Company risk management policy permits the Company to use
any combination of interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps and similar instruments. The
Company objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. The Company currently achieves this by entering into interest rate swap agreements to
convert a percentage
of its debt from variable to fixed rates. Under interest rate swap contracts, the Company agrees to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount, and to
receive in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times a notional amount. Net settlements are made on a quarterly basis. If the contracts are terminated prior to maturity,
the amount paid or received in settlement is established by agreement at the time of the termination and usually represents the net present value, at current rates of interest, of the remaining
obligations to exchange payments under the terms of the contract. The Company accounts for these swaps as cash flow hedges. Generally, the Company does not issue or hold derivative contracts for
speculative purposes. 
The
Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these interest rate swap agreements, but it does not expect any of the
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. To manage credit risks, the Company selects counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty under defined Company
guidelines, and monitors the market position with each counterparty. 
The
fair value of derivatives is included in the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is
designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of
the hedged transaction e.g., until periodic settlements of a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness which represents the amount by which
the changes in the fair value of the derivative exceed the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction is recorded in current period earnings. 
The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in
offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in the future periods. When it is determined that a derivative is not or
has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below. 
The
Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when 1it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item
including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions, such as future variable rate interest payments; 2the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised;
3it is no longer probable 
67  that
the forecasted transaction will occur; or 4management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. 
When
the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, the gain or loss on the
derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However, if it is probable that a forecasted
transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in
other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the
derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value in current-period earnings. For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash flows from
derivative instruments designated and qualifying as hedges are classified with the cash flows from the hedged item. Revenue Recognition and Promotional Allowances 
Gaming revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play
occurs and for chips in the customers' possession. Food, beverage and other revenue is recognized as services are performed. 
Revenues
are recognized net of certain sales incentives in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF consensus on Issue 01-9, Accounting for Consideration
Given by a Vendor to a Customer Including a Reseller of the Vendor products EITF 01-9. The consensus in EITF 01-9 requires that sales incentives and points earned in
point-loyalty programs be recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company recognizes incentives related to gaming play and points earned in point-loyalty programs as a direct reduction of gaming
revenue. 
The
retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenues and then deducted as promotional allowances.
The estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is primarily included in gaming expenses. The amounts included in promotional allowances are as follows: Year ended December 31,

revenue includes the Company share of pari-mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers, and the Company share of wagering
from import and export simulcasting, as well as its share of wagering from its OTWs. 
Revenue
from the management service contract for Casino Rama is based upon contracted terms and is recognized when services are performed. 
68  Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS reflects the additional dilution for all potentially-dilutive securities such as stock options. The
following table reconciles the weighted-average common shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic earnings per share to the weighted-average common shares outstanding used
in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Options to purchase 125,000, 220,000 and 260,000 shares of common stock were outstanding during the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and,
therefore the effect would be antidilutive. Year ended December 31,

The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the shares at the
date of grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants using the intrinsic-value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB 25, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation. Under the intrinsic-value method, because the
exercise price of the Company employee stock options is equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. 
The
Company accounts for the plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25 and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net
income for options granted since all options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. However, there are situations
that may occur, such as the accelerated vesting of options or the issuance of restricted stock, that require a current charge to income. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for

Segment Information 
Segment information has been prepared in accordance with SFAS131. In accordance with SFAS131, the Company views each property as an operating
segment. In addition, in accordance with SFAS131, the Company has aggregated its gaming properties that are economically similar, offer similar types of products and services table games
and/or slot machines, cater to the same types of customers local patronage and are similarly regulated into one reportable segment called gaming, and has aggregated its racing properties that are
economically similar, offer similar products and services live and simulcast racing, cater to the similar types of customers local patronage and are similarly regulated into one reportable segment
called racing. 
Statements of Cash Flows 
The Company has presented the consolidated statements of cash flows using the indirect method, which involves the reconciliation of net income to net cash flow
from operating activities. Beginning with the year ended December31, 2005, the Company changed the presentation of its cash flows to separately disclose the operating, investing and financing
portions of cash flows attributable to the Company discontinued operations. The Company had previously reported these amounts on a combined basis. This change is in response to public statements by
the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff concerning the classification of discontinued operations within the statements of cash 
70  flows.
For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, cash flows relating to discontinued operations have been separately disclosed within operating and investing activities. For the
years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there were no cash flows relating to discontinued operations that were financing activities. 
Acquisitions 
The Company accounts for acquisitions made subsequent to June30, 2001 in accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations. The Company
accounted for acquisitions made prior to June30, 2001 in accordance with APB Opinion No16, Business Combinations. The results of operations of acquisitions are included in the
consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Certain Risks and Uncertainties 
The Company operations are dependent on its continued licensing by state gaming commissions. The loss of a license, in any jurisdiction in which the Company
operates, could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations. 
The
Company is dependent on each gaming property local market for a significant number of its patrons and revenues. If economic conditions in these areas deteriorate or additional
gaming licenses are awarded in these markets, the Company results of operations could be adversely affected. The
Company is also dependent upon a stable gaming and admission tax structure in the states that it operates in. Any change in the tax structure could have a material adverse affect on
future results of operations. 
4.New Accounting Pronouncements 
In April2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule delaying the effective date of SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment SFAS123R for public companies. SFAS123R was to be effective for public companies for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June15, 2005,
however, it is now effective for public companies for the first interim or annual reporting period of the registrant first fiscal year beginning on or after June15, 2005. The rule does not
change the accounting required by SFAS123R. In accordance with the rule, on January1, 2006, the Company will begin to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for
an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The financial statement impact for the year ended December31, 2006 is expected to reduce both
earnings per share and earnings per share-assuming dilution by approximately $14 per share. 
5.Acquisitions 
Argosy Gaming Company 
On October3, 2005, the Company acquired 100% of the voting stock of Argosy. The acquisition, which was accretive to the Company results of operations,
reflects the continuing efforts of the Company to diversify by reducing our dependency on individual properties and legislative jurisdictions. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase
transaction, in accordance with SFAS141. As a result, the net assets of Argosy were recorded at their fair value, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets
acquired allocated to goodwill. The total purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $2,3202million, including transaction fees of $445million. The price of $4700 per
share represented an approximate 16% premium over the closing price of Argosy on November2, 2004, and an approximate 30% premium over the average closing share price of Argosy over the ninety
days preceding November2, 2004. The purchase price of the acquisition was funded by 
71  the
proceeds of the Company new $2725billion senior secured credit facility. See Note9: Long-term Debt for further information about the Company new senior secured
credit facility. 
The
Company acquired six Argosy casino entertainment facilities and one racetrack, although the Company agreed to enter into sale agreements for three of those properties to expedite the
receipt of the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger. The Company completed the sale of Argosy Casino Baton Rouge to Columbia Sussex for approximately $1486million, and the
Company had until December31, 2006 to enter into definitive sale agreements for the Argosy Casino Alton and the Empress Casino Hotel. See Note22: Subsequent Events for further
information about Argosy Casino Alton and the Empress Casino Hotel. The
following table sets forth the determination of the consideration paid for Argosy at the effective date of acquisition, October1, 2005, and the purchase price allocation in
thousands, except share amounts: Argosy purchase price $47 per share, 29,591,087 shares 1,390,781 Argosy bond payment 594,237 Wells Fargo payment 241,418 Purchase price of stockholders' options 32,974 Acquisition fees and other charges Transaction fees 44,547 Legal/environmental liability 7,535 Severance 8,746 60,828 Total purchase price 2,320,238 Purchase price allocation Current assets 116,895 Property and equipment 557,280 Other assets 689,389 Goodwill 1,338,979 Current liabilities 154,696 Long-term liabilities 260,583 Total net assets acquired 2,287,264 Costs paid by seller prior to close 32,974 Total purchase price 2,320,238 In
order to assist the Company in assigning values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in this transaction, the Company obtained a third-party valuation of
significant identifiable intangible assets acquired as well as other assets acquired. In addition, the Company recorded an estimate for the deferred tax liability arising from the merger due to the
difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the net assets acquired. This deferred tax liability estimate of approximately $226million increased the estimated amount of goodwill
recorded in the merger. As the deferred tax liability is an estimate, it is subject to change as the Company finalizes certain valuations and tax analyses. Changes to this estimate, if any, will also
affect goodwill and will not have a material impact on the Company consolidated statements of income. 
As
part of the Argosy acquisition, the Company acquired $20billion in goodwill and other intangible assets. The other intangible assets primarily consisted of a gaming license
intangible asset, a trademark intangible asset, a customer relationship intangible asset, and a computer software intangible asset. In accordance with SFAS142, the Company considers its gaming
license and trademark intangible assets as indefinite-useful life intangibles that do not require amortization. The customer relationship and computer software intangible assets are amortized using
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which are five and three years, respectively. As the acquisition of Argosy is 
72  treated
as a tax-free stock purchase, the estimated goodwill balance and the other intangible assets described above are not expected to be amortized for tax purposes. Excluding the impact
of Hurricane Katrina expenses and settlement costs of $211million $137million after-tax and $282million $168million after-tax,
respectively, the Argosy acquisition was accretive to the Company. 
The pro forma consolidated results of operations, as if the acquisition of Argosy had occurred on January1, 2004, are as follows 2005
2004 in thousands, except
per share data Pro Forma Net revenues 2,189,427 2,138,996 Income from continuing operations 391,940 406,400 Net income from continuing operations 111,388 128,639 Basic earnings per share 134 160 Diluted earnings per share 130 154 Included
in the Company fourth quarter results were net revenues of $900million, income from continuing operations of $176million and net income of
$49million for Argosy Casino Alton and the Empress Casino Hotel. 
6.Hurricane Katrina 
As a result of Hurricane Katrina direct hit on the Mississippi Gulf Coast on August29, 2005, two of the Company casinos, Casino MagicBay
St. Louis and Boomtown Biloxi, were significantly damaged, many employees were displaced and operations ceased at the two properties. The
Company has significant levels of insurance in place to cover the losses resulting from Hurricane Katrina including an all risk insurance policy covering named windstorm damage,
flood damage, debris removal, preservation of property expense, demolition and increased cost of construction expense, losses resulting from business interruption and extra expenses as defined in the
policy. The comprehensive business interruption and property damage insurance policies have an overall limit of $400million and are subject to property damage deductibles for Casino
MagicBay St Louis and Boomtown Biloxi of approximately $60million and $35million, respectively. The business interruption insurance component of this policy is subject
to a five-day deductible. 
The
Company recognized a pre-tax charge of $211million $137million after-tax associated with the expenses incurred from Hurricane Katrina. The
costs include property insurance and business interruption policy deductible expense approximately $102million, compensation being paid to employees through November30, 2005 that
exceeds the ordinary payroll limits under the business interruption policy approximately $61million, the purchase of replacement flood insurance for coverage during the remaining insurance
policy term approximately $36million, contributions to the Penn National Gaming Foundation for the Hurricane Katrina relief project approximately $10million and costs for
insurance claim consultants approximately $2million. 
The
charge does not reflect any loss resulting from the damage to the land-based facilities and casino barges at Casino MagicBay St. Louis and Boomtown Biloxi,
as this amount is not yet known. However, the Company believes that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to fund replacement costs. 
The
$512million insurance receivable recorded at December31, 2005 has been limited to the net historical book value of assets believed to be damaged, destroyed or
abandoned, fixed business expenses and out-of-pocket costs for certain additional expenses incurred
during the period as a direct result of the hurricane. Through December31, 2005, the Company received $273million from its insurance carriers relating to Hurricane Katrina.

December31, 2005, the Company was contingently obligated under letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior secured credit facility with face amounts aggregating
$725million. 
Senior Secured Credit Facility 
In the first quarter of 2005, the Company paid down $1107million of principal on the Term Loan D of the 2003 senior secured credit facility from
available cash flow and the proceeds of the $250million 63/4% senior subordinated notes due 2015. As a result of the accelerated principal 
75  payments
on the 2003 credit facility, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $18million for the write-off of the associated deferred finance fees. 
On
March30, 2005, the Company made an optional prepayment in the aggregate amount of $1593million to the Term Loan D facility loans to pay off all remaining loans under
the 2003 senior secured credit facility. As part of this transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $26million for the early extinguishment of debt which was offset by a $17million pre-tax gain for the termination of swap contracts related to the repaid loans. On
October3, 2005, the Company entered into a $2725billion senior secured credit facility to fund the Company acquisition of Argosy, including payment for all of
Argosy outstanding shares, the retirement of certain long-term debt of Argosy and its subsidiaries and the payment of related transaction costs, and to provide additional working
capital. Concurrent with this financing, the Company 2003 senior credit facility was terminated, which resulted in an early extinguishment of debt charge of $40million. The
$2725billion senior secured credit facility consists of three credit facilities comprised of a $750million revolving credit facility of which $1780million was drawn at
December31, 2005, a $325million Term Loan A facility and a $165billion Term Loan B facility. The 2005 credit facility also allows the Company to raise an additional
$300million in senior secured credit for project development and property expansion as well as to satisfy, if necessary, the post-closing termination rights related to the
Company pending sale of The Downs RacingInc. and its subsidiaries to the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority MTGA, which arise only in the event of certain materially adverse legislative or
regulatory events. 
The
senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. 
Redemption of 111/8% Senior Subordinated Notes 
On February8, 2005, the Company called for redemption of all the $200million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 111/8%
senior subordinated notes due March1, 2008, in accordance with the related indenture. The redemption price was $1,05563 per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
payment was made on March10, 2005. 
Interest Rate Swap Contracts 
The Company has a policy designed to manage interest rate risk associated with its current and anticipated future borrowings. This policy enables the Company to
use any combination of interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps and similar instruments. To the extent the Company employs such financial instruments pursuant to this policy, they are generally
accounted for as hedging instruments. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the underlying hedged item must expose the Company to risks associated with market fluctuations and the financial
instrument used must be designated as a hedge and must reduce the Company exposure to market fluctuations throughout the hedge period. If these criteria are not met, a change in the market value of
the financial instrument is recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change. Net settlements pursuant to the financial instrument are included as interest expense in the period. 
On
March27, 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $3750million in accordance with the terms of the
$800million senior secured credit facility. There were three two-year swap contracts totaling $175million with an effective date of March27, 2003 and a termination
date of March27, 2005. Under these contracts, the Company paid a fixed rate of 192% and received a variable rate based on the 90-day LIBOR rate. The Company also entered into
three three-year swap contracts totaling $200million with a termination date of March27, 2006. The Company accounted for these effective interest rate swap agreements as
cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair values of effective interest rate swaps were recorded as adjustments to accrued interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the offset
recorded in accumulated other 
76 
comprehensive
loss. The amount of ineffectiveness related to the cash flow hedges in 2003 was immaterial. Under these contracts, the Company paid fixed rates of 248% to 249% against a variable rate
based on the 90-day LIBOR rate. The difference between amounts received and amounts paid under such agreements, as well as any costs or fees, was recorded as a reduction of, or addition
to, interest expense as incurred over the life of the swap. 
On
September3, 2004, the Company terminated its $55million notional amount interest rate swap originally scheduled to expire on March27, 2005. The Company paid
$27,500 to terminate the swap agreement. On December5, 2004, the Company terminated its $65million notional amount interest rate swap originally scheduled to expire on March27,
2006. The Company received $379,000 to terminate the swap agreement. The Company terminated its swap agreements early in conjunction with accelerated payments of principal on the senior secured credit
facility Term D loans. On March26, 2005, the Company two-year swap contracts in the amount of $120million expired and were not renewed. The remaining $135million
of the three-year swap contracts were terminated when the associated bank debt was paid in full on April4, 2005. 
In
accordance with the terms of its new $2725billion senior secured credit facility, the Company is required to enter into interest rate swap agreements in amount equal to 50%
of the outstanding term loan balances within 100days of the closing date of the credit facility. On October27, 2005, the Company entered into four interest rate swap contracts with
terms from three to five years, notional amounts of $224million, $274million, $225million, and $237million for a total of $960million and fixed interest rates
ranging from 4678% to 4753%. The annual weighted average interest rate of the four contracts is 471%. Under these contracts, the Company pays a fixed interest rate against a variable interest rate
based on the 90-day LIBOR rate. The 90-day LIBOR rate on December31, 2005 was 453%. 
87/8% Senior Subordinated Notes 
On February28, 2002, the Company completed an offering of $175million of its 87/8% senior subordinated notes that mature on
March15, 2010. Interest on the 87/8% notes is payable on March15 and September15 of each year, beginning September15, 2002. The Company used the net
proceeds from the offering, totaling approximately $1700million after deducting underwriting discounts and related expenses, to repay term loan indebtedness under its previous senior secured
credit facility. 
The
Company may redeem all or part of the 87/8% notes on or after March15, 2006 at certain specified redemption prices. Prior to March15, 2005, the Company
may redeem up to 35% of the 87/8% notes from proceeds of certain sales of its equity securities. The 87/8% notes also are subject to redemption requirements imposed by
state and local gaming laws and regulations. 
The
87/8% notes are general unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by certain of the Company current and future wholly-owned domestic
subsidiaries. The 87/8% notes rank equally with the Company future senior subordinated debt and the 111/8% senior subordinated notes, and junior to its senior debt,
including debt under the Company senior credit facility. In addition, the 87/8% notes will be effectively junior to any indebtedness of Penn non-U.S. subsidiaries or
Unrestricted Subsidiaries, none of which have guaranteed the 87/8% notes. In
February2006, the Company called for the redemption of these senior subordinated notes. See Note22: Subsequent Events for further information about the call for
redemption. 
67/8% Senior Subordinated Notes 
On December4, 2003, the Company completed an offering of $200million of its 67/8% senior subordinated notes that mature on
December1, 2011. Interest on the notes is payable on June1 and December1 of each year, beginning June1, 2004. The Company used the net proceeds from the 
77  offering,
totaling approximately $1966million after deducting underwriting discounts and related expenses, to repay term loan indebtedness under its previous senior secured credit facility. 
The
Company may redeem all or part of the notes on or after December1, 2007 at certain specified redemption prices. Prior to December1, 2006, the Company may redeem up to
35% of the notes from
proceeds of certain sales of its equity securities. The notes are also subject to redemption requirements imposed by state and local gaming laws and regulations. The
67/8% notes are general unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by certain of the Company current and future wholly-owned domestic
subsidiaries. The 67/8% notes rank equally with the Company future senior subordinated debt and junior to its senior debt, including debt under the Company senior secured credit
facility. In addition, the 67/8% notes will be effectively junior to any indebtedness of Penn non-U.S. Unrestricted Subsidiaries. 
The
67/8% notes and guarantees were originally issued in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. On
August27, 2004, the Company completed an offer to exchange the notes and guarantees for notes and guarantees registered under the Securities Act having substantially identical terms. 
63/4% Senior Subordinated Notes 
On March9, 2005, the Company completed an offering of $250million of 63/4% senior subordinated notes. Interest on the notes is
payable on March1 and September1 of each year, beginning September1, 2005. These notes mature on March1, 2015. The 63/4% notes are general unsecured
obligations and are not guaranteed by the Company subsidiaries. The 63/4% notes were issued in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem the $200million 111/8% senior subordinated notes due March1, 2008 and repay a portion of
the term loan indebtedness under the previous senior secured credit facility. 
Sale of Argosy Casino Baton Rouge 
On October25, 2005, the Company completed the sale of Argosy Casino Baton Rouge to an affiliate of Columbia Sussex Corporation for approximately
$1486million. The Company used the net after-tax proceeds from the sale to reduce debt. Covenants 
The Company 2005 senior secured credit facility requires it, among other obligations, to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial
tests, including interest coverage, senior leverage
ratios and total leverage ratios. In addition, the 2005 senior secured credit facility restricts, among other things, the Company ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur guarantee
obligations, amend debt instruments, pay any dividends, create liens on assets, make investments, make acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, make capital expenditures, or engage in
certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates and otherwise restricts corporate activities. At December31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all required financial covenants. 
10.Commitments and Contingencies 
Litigation 
The Company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings relating to personal injuries, employment matters, commercial transactions and other
matters arising in the normal course of business. The Company does not believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial
position or results of operations. In addition, 
78  the
Company maintains what it believes is adequate insurance coverage to further mitigate the risks of such proceedings. However, such proceedings can be costly, time consuming and unpredictable and,
therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings may not materially impact the Company consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Further, no assurance
can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from such matters. 
The
following proceedings could result in costs, settlements or damages that materially impact the Company consolidated financial condition or operating results. In each instance, the
Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and/or counter-claims and intends to defend itself. 
In
October2002, in response to the Company plans to relocate the river barge underlying the Boomtown Biloxi casino to an adjacent property, the lessor of the property on which
the Boomtown Biloxi casino conducts a portion of its dockside operations filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi seeking a declaratory
judgment that ithe Company must use the leased premises for a gaming use or, in the alternative, iiafter the move, the Company will remain obligated to make the revenue-based rent
payments to plaintiff set forth in the lease. The plaintiff filed this suit immediately after the Mississippi Gaming Commission approved the Company request to relocate the barge. Since such
approval, the Mississippi Department of Marine
Resources and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have also approved the Company plan to relocate the barge. In March2004, the trial court ruled in favor of the Company on all counts. The
plaintiff appealed the decision to the Fifth Circuit, and on May3, 2005, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the trial court decision should be affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.
In its decision, the Fifth Circuit upheld the tenant right to relocate but remanded the case to the trial court because there was insufficient evidence in the record to determine whether the casino
barge would be relocated to a place which would trigger the increased rent obligation under the lease. After the remand, the Mississippi Supreme Court issued a decision dealing with analogous
landlord/tenant issues which the Company has argued disposes of the remaining dispute in this litigation. The trial court has not made a ruling regarding the effect of the Mississippi Supreme Court
decision on this litigation and instead, after Hurricane Katrina, the court requested the parties to decide whether they desire to stay the case until the Company informs the court of any new
relocation plans and whether a decision by the Court is even required to pursue such relocation plans. The Company is currently considering its relocation options in light of the damage caused by the
hurricane. 
In
November2005, Capital Seven, LLC and Shawn A. Scott Capital Seven, the sellers of Bangor Historic Track BHT, filed a demand for arbitration with the American
Arbitration Association seeking $302million plus interest and other damages. Capital Seven alleges a breach of contract by the Company based on the Company payment of a $51million
purchase price for the purchase of BHT instead of an alleged $81million purchase price the sellers claim is due under the purchase agreement. The parties had agreed that the purchase price of
BHT would be determined, in part, by the applicable gaming taxes imposed by Maine on our operations, and currently are disputing the effective tax rate. The dispute is currently in its initial stages.
The Company filed a Counter-Statement and Answer on December15, 2005, and the parties are in the process of choosing arbitrators. 
In
conjunction with the Company merger with Argosy, the Company became responsible for litigation initiated over eight years ago related to the Baton Rouge property formerly owned by
Argosy. On November26, 1997, Capitol House filed an amended petition in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for East Baton Rouge Parish, State of Louisiana, amending its previously filed
but unserved suit against Richard Perryman, the person selected by the Louisiana Gaming Division to evaluate and rank the applicants seeking a gaming license for East Baton Rouge Parish, and adding
state law claims against Jazz, the Former Jazz Shareholders, Argosy Gaming Company, Argosy of Louisiana,Inc. and Catfish Queen Partnership in Commendam, d/b/a the Belle of Baton Rouge Casino.
This suit alleges 
79  that
these parties violated the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act in connection with obtaining the gaming license that was issued to Jazz Enterprises,Inc./Catfish Queen Partnership in
Commendam. The plaintiff, an applicant for a gaming license whose application was denied by the Louisiana Gaming Division, seeks to prove that the gaming license was invalidly issued and seeks to
recover lost gaming revenues that the plaintiff contends it should have earned if the gaming license had been properly issued to the plaintiff. In June2003, the Louisiana trial court dismissed
this lawsuit. The trial court decision was affirmed by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, but subsequently reversed by the Louisiana Supreme Court on March24, 2005, which remanded the case
back to the trial court for further proceedings. 
The
Company has the right to seek indemnification from the former Jazz shareholders for any liability suffered as a result of such cause of action, however, there can be no assurance
that the former Jazz shareholders will have assets sufficient to satisfy any claim in excess of Argosy recoupment rights. One of the three former Jazz shareholders has filed for bankruptcy in Reno,
Nevada, and the Company is currently involved in litigation in the bankruptcy court with certain creditors who dispute the Company legal right to recoup certain indebtedness and obligations owed it
against the deferred payments otherwise payable to the former Jazz shareholders, including Argosy right to indemnity for legal fees and any possible adverse judgment rendered in connection with the
Capitol House litigation. 
Operating Lease Commitments 
The Company is liable under numerous operating leases for an airplane, automobiles, other equipment and buildings, which expire through 2014. Total rental expense
under these agreements was $52million, $43million, and $35million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The
Company is also liable for several land leases for the property on which some of its casinos operate. The lease terms are from one to eighty-seven years. The leases consist of annual
base lease rent payments, which are included in the table below, plus a percentage rent based on a percent of adjusted gaming wins, as described in the respective leases. For the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company paid land lease rent under these agreements of $107million, $112million, and $115million, respectively. 
The
Company has an operating lease with the City of Bangor for a permanent facility which the Company plans to open in the second quarter of 2008, at a budgeted cost of
$710million. This permanent facility is subject to a percentage rent: 3% of the first $50million of gross slot revenue, 4% of the next $200million, 5% of the next
$300million and 6% thereafter. The lease is for an initial term of ten years with four ten-year renewal options. The initial term begins with the opening of the permanent facility. During
2005, the Company made lease payments to the City of Bangor of $35,000. An agreement with the City of Bangor calls for a two-year rent moratorium for 2006 and 2007. 
The
future minimum lease commitments relating to noncancelable operating leases at December31, 2005 are as follows in thousands: Year ending December 31, 2006 15,908 2007 14,000 2008 13,411 2009 11,033 2010 11,043 Thereafter 13,678 Total 79,073 80  Capital Expenditure Commitments 
At December31, 2005, the Company is contractually committed to spend approximately $504million in capital expenditures for projects in progress. Employee Benefit Plans 
The Company has two profit sharing plans under the provisions of Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which covers all eligible
employees. The plans enable participating employees to defer a portion of their salary in a retirement fund to be administered by the Company. For the Penn National Gaming,Inc. 401k Plan,
the Company makes a discretionary match contribution of 50% of employees' elective salary deferrals, up to a maximum of 6% of eligible employee compensation. For the Argosy Gaming Company Employees
Savings Plan, the Company makes a discretionary match contribution of 50% of employees' elective salary deferrals up to the lesser of 3% of eligible employee compensation, or $2,000 per year. The
Company also has a defined contribution plan, the Charles Town Races Future Service Retirement Plan, covering substantially all of its union employees at the Charles Town
Entertainment Complex. The Company makes annual contributions to this plan for the eligible union employees and to the Penn National Gaming,Inc. 401k Plan for the eligible
non-union employees for an amount equal to the amount accrued for retirement expense, which is calculated as 0025% of the daily mutual handle and 1% up to a base of the net video lottery
revenues and, after the base is met, it reverts to 005%. Total contributions to the plans for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $27million, $38million and
$28million, respectively. 
The
Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that covers most management and other highly compensated employees. This plan was effective March1,
2001. The plan allows the participants to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion of their base annual salary and bonus and earn tax-deferred earnings on these deferrals. The plan
also provides for matching Company contributions that vest over a five-year period. The Company has established a Trust and transfers to the Trust, on a periodic basis, an amount necessary
to provide on a present value basis for its respective future liabilities with respect to participant deferral and Company contribution amounts. Company contributions in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
$11million, $8million and $6million, respectively. 
Agreements with Horsemen and Pari-Mutuel Clerks 
The Company is required to have agreements with the horsemen at each of its racetracks to conduct its live racing and simulcasting activities. In addition, in
order to operate gaming machines in West Virginia, the Company must maintain agreements with each of the Charles Town horsemen, pari-mutuel clerks and breeders. 
At
the Charles Town Entertainment Complex, the Company has an agreement with the Charles Town horsemen that expires on December31, 2007 and an agreement with the breeders that
expires on June30, 2006. The pari-mutuel clerks at Charles Town were represented under a collective bargaining agreement with the West Virginia Division of Mutuel Clerks that
expired in June2005. We have subsequently reached a new agreement that has been ratified by the membership of the West Virginia Division of Mutuel Clerks. We are in the process of documenting
the final agreement and are currently operating under a combination of some elements of the prior agreement and the new agreement. 
Throughout
the Argosy properties, the Seafarers Entertainment and Allied Trade Union represents 2,153 employees. Additionally, at the Alton property, the Seafarer International Union of
North America, Atlantic, Gulf, Lakes and Inland Waters District/NMU, AFL-CIO represents eight of the Company employees, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers represents
nine of the Company employees and the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America represents sixty-three 
81  of
the Company employees. At the Company Indiana and Iowa properties, the American Maritime Officers Union represents twenty of the Company employees. The Company has collective bargaining
agreements with these unions that expire at various times between July2007 and June2011. At the Empress Casino Hotel, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees HERE Union, Local
1 represents three hundred employees. The HERE Joliet labor agreement expires on March31, 2010. At Raceway Park, the pari-mutuel tellers are represented by the Service Employees
International Union SEIU Local 47, which has subcontracted with HERE Local 10 to handle the business affairs of the pari-mutuel tellers, and the current contract expires on
May31, 2007. 
The
Company agreement with the Pennsylvania thoroughbred horsemen at Penn National Race Course expires on September30, 2011. The Company has an agreement with Local 137 at Penn
National Race Course with respect to pari-mutuel clerks and admissions and Telebet personnel that expires on December31, 2007. The Company also has an agreement in place with the
Sports Arena Employees Local 137 AFL-CIO with respect to
pari-mutuel clerks and admission personnel at the OTWs. That agreement, which the Company is currently renegotiating, expires on March30, 2006. 
We
expect to enter into a new, long-term, agreement with the Maine Harness Horsemen Association prior to the start of the 2006 racing season. Pennwood Racing also has an agreement in
effect with the horsemen at Freehold Raceway which expires in May2006. 
If
the Company fails to maintain agreements with the horsemen at a track, it will not be permitted to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting at that track and where
applicable, the OTWs. In West Virginia, the Company will not be permitted to operate its gaming machines if it fails to maintain agreements with the Charles Town horsemen, pari-mutuel
clerks and breeders. In addition, the simulcasting agreements are subject to the horsemen approval. If the Company fails to maintain necessary agreements, this failure could have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Except for the closure of the facilities at Penn National Race Course and its OTWs from February16, 1999 to
March24, 1999 due to a horsemen strike, and a few days at other times and locations, the Company has been able to maintain the necessary agreements. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to maintain the required agreements. 
New Jersey Joint Venture 
On January28, 1999, the Company, along with its joint venture partner, Greenwood New Jersey,Inc. Greenwood, purchased certain assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Freehold Racing Association, Garden State Racetrack and related entities, in a transaction accounted for as a purchase transaction. 
The
Company made an $113million loan to the joint venture and an equity investment of $3million. The loan is evidenced by a subordinated secured note, which has been
included in investment in and advances to an unconsolidated affiliate in the consolidated financial statements. The note bears interest at prime plus 225% or a minimum of 10% at December31,
2005, the interest rate was 10%. The Company has recorded interest income in the consolidated statements of income of $11million for each of the years ended December31, 2005, 2004
and 2003. 
The
joint venture, through Freehold Racing Association, is part of a multi-employer pension plan. For collectively bargained, multi-employer pension plans, contributions are made in
accordance with negotiated labor contracts and generally are based on days worked. With the passage of the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, the joint venture may, under certain
circumstances, become subject to liabilities in excess of contributions made under collective bargaining agreements. Generally, these liabilities are contingent upon the termination, withdrawal, or
partial withdrawal from the plans. At December31, 2005, the most recent date for which information is available, the joint venture has been informed that its withdrawal liability was
approximately $31million. These amounts, and the joint venture obligation to fund any portion of it, are subject to many factors outside of the 
82  joint
venture control, including actuarial experience and investment performance of the underlying multi-employer pension plan. 
The
Company and Greenwood entered into a Debt Service Maintenance Agreement with a bank in which each joint venture partner has guaranteed up to 50% of a $230million term loan
to the joint venture. The guarantee remains in effect for the life of the loan and is due to expire on September30, 2009. At December31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the loan to
the joint venture amounted to $146million of which the Company obligation under its guarantee of the term loan was limited to approximately $73million. The Company investment in
the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. The original investment was recorded at cost and has been adjusted by the Company share of income of the joint venture and distributions
received. The Company 50% share of the income of the joint venture is included in other income expenses in the consolidated statements of income. 11.Income Taxes 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following in thousands: December 31,

valuation allowance represents the income tax effect of state net operating loss carryforwards of the Company, which are not presently expected to be utilized. 
For
income tax reporting, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards aggregating approximately $1415million available to reduce future state income taxes primarily for the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as of December31, 2005. Due to Pennsylvania tax statute on annual net operating loss utilization limit, a valuation allowance has been recorded to reflect the
net operating losses which are not presently expected to be realized. If not used, substantially all the carryforwards will expire at various dates from December31, 2006 to December31,
2024. 
The
federal net operating loss and general business credits resulted from the acquisition of Hollywood Casino Corporation during 2003. They have been fully utilized by
December31, 2005.

Stock Split 
On February3, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 split of the Company common stock. The
stock split was in the form of a stock dividend of one additional share of the Company common stock for each share held. The additional shares were distributed on March7, 2005 to
shareholders of record on February14, 2005. As a result of the stock dividend, the number of outstanding shares of the Company common stock increased to approximately 828million.
All references in the consolidated financial statements to
number of shares and net income per share amounts of the Company common stock have been retroactively restated to reflect the increased number of common stock shares outstanding. 
Shareholder Rights Plan 
On May20, 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one Preferred Stock purchase right the Right
or Rights for each outstanding share of the Company common stock, par value $01 per share the Common Shares, payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on March19,
1999. Each Right entitles the registered 
84  holder
to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share a Preferred Stock Fraction, or a combination of securities and assets of equivalent value, at a purchase price of
$1000 per Preferred Stock Fraction, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement the Rights Agreement dated March2, 1999 between the
Company and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company as Rights Agent. All terms not otherwise defined herein are used as defined in the Rights Agreement. 
The
Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the Company common stock the Stock Acquisition Date, announces a tender or exchange offer that will
result in such person or group acquiring 20% or more of the outstanding common stock or is a beneficial owner of a substantial amount of Common Shares at least 10% whose ownership may have a
material adverse impact Adverse Person on the business or prospects of the Company. The Company will be entitled to redeem the Rights at a price of $01 per Right payable in cash or stock at any
time until 10days following the Stock Acquisition Date or the date on which a person has been determined to be an Adverse Person. If the Company is involved in certain transactions after the
Rights become exercisable, a Holder of Rights other than Rights owned by a shareholder who has acquired 15% or more of the Company outstanding common stock or is determined to be an Adverse Person,
which Rights become void is entitled to buy a number of the acquiring company Common Shares or the Company common stock, as the case may be, having a market value of twice the exercise price of
each Right. A potential dilutive effect may exist upon the exercise of the Rights. Until a Right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without
limitations, the right to vote as a stockholder or to receive dividends. The Rights are not exercisable until the distribution date, and will expire at the close of business on March18, 2009,
unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company. 
14.Stock-Based Compensation 
In April1994, the Company Board of Directors and shareholders adopted and approved the 1994 Stock Option Plan the 1994 Plan. The 1994 Plan permitted
the grant of options to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to antidilution adjustments, at a price per share no less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on
the date an option is granted with respect to incentive stock options only. The price would be no less than 110% of fair market value in the case of an incentive stock option granted to any individual
who owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of outstanding stock. The 1994 Plan provided for the granting of both incentive stock options intended to qualify under
Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and nonqualified stock options, which do not so qualify. The 1994 Plan terminated in April2004. 
On
April16, 2003, the Company Board of Directors adopted and approved the 2003 Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan the 2003 Plan. On May22, 2003, the Company
shareholders approved the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan was effective June1, 2003 and permits the grant of options to purchase Common Stock and other market-based and performance-based awards. Up
to 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock are available for awards under the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan provides for the granting of both incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and nonqualified stock options, which do not so qualify. The exercise price per share may be no less than i100% of the fair market value of
the Common Stock on the date an option is granted for incentive stock options and ii85% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date an option is granted for nonqualified stock
options. Unless this plan is extended, no awards shall be granted or exchanges effected under this plan after May31, 2013. At December31, 2005, there were 6,169,500 options available
for future grants under the 2003 Plan. 
Stock
options that expire between February8, 2007 and January16, 2015 have been granted to officers, directors and employees to purchase Common Stock at prices ranging
from $203 to $3795 per share. All options were granted at market prices at date of grant.

On August27, 2004, the Company unrestricted subsidiary, Hollywood Casino Shreveport HCS, in cooperation with an Ad Hoc Committee representing a
majority of its noteholders, entered into an agreement with Eldorado Resorts LLC Eldorado providing for acquisition of HCS by certain affiliates of Eldorado Eldorado Transaction. On
September10, 2004, a group of HCS creditors, led by Black Diamond Capital Management, LLC, filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Western District of Louisiana U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
located in Shreveport, Louisiana, an involuntary petition against HCS for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October18, 2004, HCS, acting by and through HCS
I,Inc., entered into the Eldorado Agreement with Eldorado and certain affiliates of Eldorado providing for the acquisition of the reorganized HCS by certain affiliates of Eldorado. On
October28, 2004, HCS filed a joint plan and disclosure statement that incorporated the Eldorado Transaction. On October30, 2004, HCS agreed to the entry of an order for relief in the
Chapter 11 case that had been filed against it, and HCS I,Inc., HCS II,Inc., HWCC-Louisiana,Inc. and Shreveport Capital Corporation commenced voluntary cases under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. HCS debt was non-recourse to the Company and its other subsidiaries. 
HCS
filed a revised Chapter 11 plan and disclosure statement with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on March3, 2005. Subsequently, the Official Bondholder Committee in the Chapter 11
case joined HCS as a proponent of the plan. Black Diamond Capital Management, LLC and KOAR International both expressed interest in acquiring the hotel and casino and asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for permission to file their own competing plan, but on April15, 2005, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court ruled against allowing them to submit their competing reorganization plan to the creditors. On
April21, 2005, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the disclosure statement for HCS plan and on June19, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement agreement announced in open
court for the confirmation of the joint plan proposed by HCS and the Bondholders Committee the Joint Plan, as modified based on the announced settlement. The terms of the Eldorado Agreement were
incorporated in the Joint Plan. 
On
July6, 2005, HCS filed the Joint Plan with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, as amended, to reflect the settlement reached by the parties, and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court entered an
order confirming the amended Joint Plan. The Joint Plan provided for the acquisition of HCS by certain affiliates of Eldorado and, on July22, 2005, the acquisition was completed. As a result,
the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax gain of approximately $583million representing the aggregate amount of previously recorded losses. The after-tax
effect of the gain is approximately $379million. 
The
Company has reflected the results of this transaction by classifying the assets, liabilities and results of operations of HCS as assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued
operations in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS144. Financial information for HCS was
previously reported as part of the gaming reportable segment.

In
January2005, the Company received $280million from the MTGA, and transferred the operations of The Downs Racing,Inc. and its subsidiaries to the MTGA. The sale
is not considered final, as the MTGA received certain post-closing termination rights that remain outstanding. Reflecting taxes, post closing adjustments, fees and other expenses, the
Company realized net proceeds of approximately $175million, which, in accordance with the Company credit agreement, were used to retire debt or to reinvest in capital expenditures. The
Company recorded the net proceeds, after paying down approximately $60million of the senior credit facility, as restricted cash. The Company applied the remaining balance of the restricted
cash, of approximately $970million, to senior debt reduction in April2005. Under the terms of the agreement, MTGA acquired The Downs Racing,Inc. and its subsidiaries,
including Pocono Downs a standardbred horse racing facility located on 400 acres in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and five Pennsylvania off-track wagering facilities located in Carbondale,
East Stroudsburg, Erie, Hazelton and Lehigh Valley Allentown. The sale agreement also provides the MTGA with certain post-closing termination rights in the event of certain materially
adverse legislative or regulatory events. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the net book gain on this transaction of approximately $1259million net of $977million of
income taxes will not be recorded as a sale until the post closing termination rights have expired.

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
controls and procedures. 
Based
upon the evaluation of the Company disclosure controls and procedures by the Company management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as of December31, 2005, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in Rule13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 
Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15f. There are inherit limitations in the effectiveness of any internal controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Our internal
control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2005 to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We
have excluded the operations of Argosy Gaming Company from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, because it was acquired by the Company in a
purchase business combination during fiscal year 2005. The Argosy operation total assets excluding goodwill and total net revenues represented approximately $1,2636million and
$2531million, respectively, included in our consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2005. Our management assessment of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is
included below. 
95  Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
There were no significant changes in the Company internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company internal controls over financial reporting. 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
To The Board of Directors of Penn National Gaming,Inc. and subsidiaries: 
We
have audited management assessment, included in Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Penn National Gaming,Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
As
indicated in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included in Item9A, management assessment of and conclusion on the
effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting excludes the internal controls of the Argosy Gaming Company, which is included in the consolidated financial statements of Penn National Gaming, Inc the Company, and
constituted $1,2636million of total assets as of December31, 2005 and $2531million of total net revenues for the year then ended. Management did not assess the effectivenes
of internal control over financial reporting at Argosy Gaming Company because it was acquired on October3, 2005. Our audit of the internal control over financial reporting of the Company also
did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Argosy Gaming Company. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that Penn National Gaming,Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. 
96 
We
have also audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Penn National Gaming,Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2005, and our report dated March7, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/BDO SEIDMAN LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
