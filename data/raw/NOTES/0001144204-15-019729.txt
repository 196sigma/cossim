PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Empire Resources, Inc.
Fort Lee, New Jersey We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Empire Resources, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of
December31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and
stockholders' equity for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our
audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Empire
Resources, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. s/ EisnerAmper LLP New York, New York

Empire Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements In thousands, except per share amounts Note A Business Empire Resources, Inc. the Company
is engaged principally in the purchase, sale and distribution of value added semi-finished aluminum and steel products to a diverse
customer base located throughout the Americas, Australia, Europe and New Zealand. The Company sells its products through its own
marketing and sales personnel and through independent sales agents located in the U.S., Australia and Europe who receive commissions
on sales. The Company purchases from several suppliers located throughout the world see Note B [14]. Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies 1]Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Empire Resources Pacific Ltd., the
Companys sales agent in Australia, 6900 Quad Avenue LLC, the owner of the warehouse facility in Baltimore, Maryland,
Empire Resources de Mexico, the Companys subsidiary in Mexico, and Imbali Metals BVBA, the Companys operating
subsidiary in Europe. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. 2]Revenue recognition Revenue on product sales is recognized
at the point in time when the product has been shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer,
and the following conditions are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability
of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. 3]Accounts receivable
and allowance policy Accounts receivable are stated as the outstanding
balance due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains a credit insurance policy with a 10%
co-pay provision for most accounts receivable. The Company will provide an allowance for doubtful accounts in the event that it
determines there may be probable losses beyond the credit insurance coverage. 4]Inventories Inventories which consist of purchased
semi-finished metal products are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the specific-identification method.
Inventory has generally been purchased for specific customer orders. The carrying amount of inventory which is hedged by futures
contracts designated as fair value hedges is adjusted to fair value. 5]Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost
and depreciated by the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Impaired assets are written down to their fair value. 6]Derivatives The Company recognizes all derivatives
in the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative
is a hedge, depending upon the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change
in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings fair value hedge, or recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings cash flow hedge. The ineffective portion of a derivatives
change in fair value, if any, is immediately recognized in earnings. When a hedged item in a fair value hedge is sold, the adjustment
in the carrying amount of the hedged item is recognized in earnings see Note E.   - 29 -
7]Foreign currency translation The functional currency of Empire Resources
Pacific Ltd., a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary which acts as a sales agent in Australia and New Zealand, is the Australian dollar.
The Company also has a wholly owned foreign subsidiary incorporated in Belgium which sells semi-finished metal products in Europe.
The functional currency of this subsidiary is the Euro. Cumulative translation adjustments, which are charged or credited to accumulated
other comprehensive income, arise from translation of functional currency amounts into U.S. dollars. 8]Income taxes The Company follows the asset and liability
approach for deferred income taxes. This method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded, using currently
enacted tax rates, based upon the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial
statement purposes. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances
are recorded when management does not believe that it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized. 9]Per share data Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share give
effect to all dilutive outstanding stock options, using the treasury stock method and assumed conversion of subordinated debt see
Note O. 10]Stock - based compensation Stock-based compensation expense for an
award of equity instruments, including stock options, is recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award
at the grant date. 11]Newly Effective Accounting
Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued new accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09,Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, on revenue recognition. The new standard provides for a single five-step model to be applied to all revenue contracts
with customers as well as requires additional financial statement disclosures that will enable users to understand the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. Companies have an option to use either
a retrospective approach or cumulative effect adjustment approach to implement the standard. There is no option for early adoption.
For public entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15,
2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 12]Fair Value Authoritative guidance defines fair value
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, as described below Level
1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
liabilities. 
Level
2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.
Level
3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. Derivative contracts consisting of aluminum
contracts, foreign currency contracts, and interest rate swaps are valued using quoted market prices and significant other observable
inputs. These financial instruments are typically exchange-traded and are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the
fair value hierarchy depending on whether the exchange is deemed to be an active market or not. The conversion option embedded
in convertible subordinated notes issued in 2011 was valued using Level 3 inputs.   - 30 -
Major categories of assets and liabilities
measured at fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013 are classified as follows

13]Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
these estimates. 14]Significant customers
and concentration of suppliers No customer accounted for sales in excess
of 10% during 2014 or 2013. The Companys purchase of metal products
is from several suppliers located throughout the world. Two suppliers, PT. Alumindo and Hulamin Ltd, accounted for 37% of total
purchases for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 51% of total purchases during the year ended December 31, 2013. The
Companys loss of any of its largest suppliers or a material default by any such supplier in its obligations to the Company
would have at least a short-term material adverse effect on the Companys business. Note C Fair Value of Financial
Instruments The carrying amounts of variable rate notes
payable to the banks and the variable rate mortgage payable approximate fair value as of December31, 2014 and 2013 because
these notes reflect market changes to interest rates. The fair value of the subordinated convertible debt approximates its principal
amount of $11,000 at December 31, 2014 and $12,000 at December 31, 2013, which exceeds its carrying amount as a result of the unamortized
discount related to the bifurcation of the embedded conversion option. The carrying amount of the advance to supplier approximates
its fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013. Fair value of financial instruments are based on level 2 inputs. Derivative financial
instruments are carried at fair value see Note B [12].   - 31 -

Instruments and Risk Management The Company uses derivative financial instruments
designated as fair value hedges to manage its exposure to commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk inherent in its
operations. It is the Companys policy to hedge such risks to the extent practicable. The Company enters into high-grade
aluminum futures contracts to limit its gross margin exposure by hedging the metal content element of firmly committed purchase
and sales commitments. The Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its exposure related to commitments
to buy and sell its products denominated in international currencies, primarily the Australian dollar. The Companys unrealized assets and
liabilities in respect of its fair value hedges measured at fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows   Derivatives designated

$1,363 For the years ended December 31, 2014,
and 2013, hedge ineffectiveness associated with derivatives designated as fair value hedges was insignificant, and no fair value
hedges were derecognized. As discussed in Note G, the Company entered
into an interest rate swap to convert a mortgage from a variable rate to a fixed rate obligation. This swap was designated as a
cash flow hedge and the Companys unrealized liabilities relating to the swap measured at fair value at December 31, 2014

$2,844 Note G Mortgage Payable In December 2004, the Company entered into
a mortgage in connection with the purchase of a warehouse. The mortgage required monthly payments of approximately $216 including
interest, at LIBOR + 175% and matured in December 2014. In connection with the mortgage, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap with a bank which was designated as a cash flow hedge. Effective 2004 through December 29, 2014,
the Company paid a fixed interest rate of 637% to the bank on a notional principal equal to the outstanding principal balance
of the mortgage. In return, the bank paid the Company a floating rate, namely, LIBOR, to reset monthly plus 175% on the same notional
principal amount. This interest rate swap expired in December 2014. Note H - Notes Payable Prior to June 19, 2014, we were a party
to credit agreement with Rabobank International, for itself and as lead arranger and agent, JPMorgan Chase, for itself and as syndication
agent, and ABN AMRO, BNP Paribas, RBS Citizens, Socit Gnrale, and Brown Brothers Harriman which
provided for a $200,000 revolving line of credit, including a commitment to issue letters of credit and a swing-line loan sub facility,
with a maturity date of June 30, 2014. On June 19, 2014 we entered into an amended
and restated committed credit agreement with Rabobank International, for itself and as lead arranger and agent, BNP Paribas, for
itself and as syndication agent, and Socit Gnrale, ABN AMRO, RB International, and Brown Brothers
Harriman as well as a new uncommitted line of credit with Rabobank International, BNP Paribas and Socit Gnrale.
Both credit lines are secured, asset-based credit facilities. The committed credit facility provided for amounts up to $150,000,
and the uncommitted facility provided for a maximum amount of $75,000. The agreement also allowed for an additional increase in
the committed credit facility of $75,000, for a total of $300,000, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. On December
18, 2014, we amended and increased this working capital credit agreement by $50 million increasing our overall line of credit to
$275 million. The amended committed credit agreement has been increased by $35 million to $185 million, and the uncommitted credit
facility, increased by $15 million to $90 million. There are no changes to the interest rate or to the maturity date of the committed
facility, which remains June 19, 2017. Subsequent to these amendments the additional increase available under the term of these
agreements is $25,000, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. Our borrowings under this line of credit are secured by
substantially all of our assets.   - 33 -
Amounts borrowed bear interest at Eurodollar,
money market or base rates, at our option, plus an applicable margin.The credit agreements contain financial
and other covenants, including but not limited to, covenants requiring maintenance of minimum tangible net working capital and
compliance with leverage ratios, as well as an ownership minimum and limitations on other indebtedness, liens, distributions or
dividends, and investments and dispositions of assets.The Company is in compliance with all
covenants under this credit agreement. Both credit agreements provide that amounts
under the facilities may be borrowed and repaid, and re-borrowed, subject to a borrowing base test. The committed line of credit
matures June 19, 2017 and the uncommitted credit agreement must be repaid by the Company on or before June 19, 2015 unless otherwise
agreed to.As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the credit utilized amounted to, respectively, $229,386 and
$174,605 including approximately $36,586 and $71,105 of outstanding letters of credit. The Companys wholly owned Belgian
subsidiary, Imbali Metals BVBA, Imbali operates under a line of credit with ING Belgium S.A./N.V., with a EUR 8,000
$9,679 commitment for loans and documentary letters of credit. Loan advances are limited to a percentage of Imbalis pledged
accounts receivable and inventory. This secured credit arrangement is unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. As of December
31, 2014, Imbali had borrowings of EUR 6,850$8,288 under this line of credit bearing interest at EURIBOR plus 175%, and was
in compliance with all financial covenants. As of December 31, 2013, Imbali had borrowings of EUR 3,217$4,422 under this line
of credit, bearing interest at EURIBOR plus 175%, and was in compliance with all financial covenants. Note I Convertible Subordinated
Debt On June 3, 2011, the Company sold $12,000

declared on common stock subsequent to the issuance of the notes through such date.In addition, if the last reported
sale price of the Companys common stock for 30 consecutive trading days is equal to or greater than $700, and a registration
statement is effective covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, the Company has

rate.Interest on the notes is payable in arrears on the first day of June and December every year the notes are outstanding.
The note contains covenants, including restrictions on the Companys ability to incur certain indebtedness and create certain
liens. Officers and directors of the Company and certain affiliated entities purchased $4,000 principal amount of the notes. On August 18, 2014, a note holder converted $1,000 principal
amount of notes into 254 shares of common stock, having a fair value on such date of $1,507. The carrying value of the note converted
was $916, and the carrying value of the related embedded conversion option was $427 resulting in a loss on extinguishment of the
debt of $164.   - 34 -
The majority of proceeds of the convertible
subordinated debt was earmarked for a long term advance in connection with a supply agreement with the Indonesian company PT. Alumindo
Light Metal Industry Tbk, PT. Alumindo a leading producer of high quality semi-finished aluminum products, and its affiliates,
as described below. The agreement called for, and the Company provided a $10,000 non-interest bearing loan to an affiliate
of PT. Alumindo to enable the expansion of capacity within that group of companies production network.The agreements
also provide for a long term, multi-year substantial and preferential supply position from PT. Alumindo premier aluminum rolling
mill located in Surabaya, Indonesia. The loan is being repaid to the Company beginning on January 1, 2013 in monthly
installments of $278. If the Company and PT. Alumindo are unable to agree on a product price under the supply agreement for any
given quarter, the monthly re-payment obligation will increase to $556 and the outstanding balance will accrue interest, at the
one month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate plus 35% per annum, per month. The entire remaining balance, if any, must be repaid on January
1, 2016. The specific parties to the agreement, PT. Alumindo, Southern Aluminum Industry and Fung Lam Trading Company, are related
parties controlled by the Maspion Group - Indonesia. The Fung Lam Trading Company Ltd, which is wholly owned by the Maspion
Group, is a holding company for the groups investments in China, including 70% ownership of Southern Aluminum Industry.
The loan was made to Fung Lam Trading Company Ltd at the request of Maspion Group Indonesia. The purpose of the loan was
to allow the Maspion Group - Indonesia to increase their overall production capacity, specifically for regional markets and for
distribution in China. As consideration for this loan the Maspion Group - Indonesia agreed to make available a committed and significant
tonnage of production to the Company on a guaranteed and long-term basis, which will help the Company lessen the risk of an interruption
in the sources of its metal supply, from PT. Alumindos mill in Surabaya, Indonesia, with which the Company has had substantial
experience. The supply agreement calls for increased supply and minimum tonnages. Interest at the rate of 369%, based on
the interest rate chargeable in the agreement in the event the supplier does not meet its supply commitments, has been imputed
on the non-interest bearing advance and the resulting discount which amounted to $962, has been ascribed to the preferential supply
agreement. Imputed interest income is being recognized over the term of the advance by use of the interest method and amounted
to $177 and $293 during 2014 and 2013 respectively, and is included in interest expense, net. The preferential supply agreement
is being amortized by the straight line method over three years starting from January 1, 2013, the date that the increased supply
began. Amortization expense for each of the years 2014 and 2013 amounted to $321. As a result of transactions which cause
adjustments to the conversion rate, the embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and recorded as a separate derivative liability
at a fair value at issuance of the notes of $2,829, with a corresponding discount recorded on the notes. The derivative liability
is carried at fair value with changes therein recorded in income. The quarterly mark to market of the derivative liability will
result in non-operating, non-cash gains or losses based on decreases or increases in the Companys stock market price, respectively,
among other factors. The non-cash discount is being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the notes. During
the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the change in the fair value of the derivative liability resulted in a
loss of $1,113 and $52, respectively, and amortization of the discount amounted to $481 and $565 in the years ended December 31,
2014 and 2013, respectively. The derivative liability was valued using
a lattice model using Level 3 inputs. This technique was selected because it embodies all of the types of inputs that the Company
expects market participants would consider in determining the fair value of equity linked derivatives embedded in hybrid debt agreements. The following table summarizes the significant
inputs resulting from the calculations at issuance and year end

$3,432 Foreign income and related foreign income
taxes primarily relates to the Companys subsidiary companies Imbali, its Belgian subsidiary and Empire Resources de Mexico.
For US income tax purposes, the Company has elected to treat Imbali as a disregarded entity and include its taxable income in the
Companys consolidated federal income tax return and separate state income tax returns. Empire Resources de Mexico is taxed
as a corporation in Mexico. Due to U.S. tax rules dealing with constructive repatriation of earnings, such earnings are also currently
included in the Companys consolidated federal income tax return and separate state income tax return. Federal income taxes
attributable to the subsidiaries taxable income are offset by tax credits for foreign taxes paid by the subsidiaries. Undistributed
earnings of Imbali amounted to approximately $3,531 while those of Empire Resources de Mexico were approximately $506 at December
31, 2014. Upon distribution of Imbalis earnings in the form of dividends, the Company would be required to pay Belgian withholding
tax at the rate of 5%. As the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest such earnings, no provision for such withholding tax has
been provided. Mexico does not have a withholding tax on dividends paid from Mexican corporations. For federal income tax purposes,
foreign tax credits would be available to the Company for the withholding tax, subject to limitations. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from
an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement.   - 39 -

$249 aLiability included
in income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets. The total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits at December 31, 2014 and 2013 would impact the Companys effective tax rate, if recognized. During 2014 the
Company reversed $79 of the liability principally due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and reduced income
tax expense. During 2013, upon settlement of a tax assessment with the State of California covering the years 2007 through 2012,
the Company reversed $81 of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and reduced income tax expense. The Company
recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses. The
Company reversed approximately $41 and $148 of accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the years ended
December 31, 2014 and 2013 as the result of the reduction in unrecognized benefits and the California settlement,
respectively. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued in the Companys balance sheet at December 31, 2014
and 2013 amounted to approximately $66 and $107, respectively. The Company files a consolidated federal
income tax return and also files income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. With certain exceptions, the Company is no
longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years before 2011. Note N - Employee Retirement Benefits The Company has implemented a salary reduction
employee benefit plan, under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees may contribute up to the maximum amount allowable
by law and the Company will provide a matching contribution of 50% of employee contributions, limited to 2% of employee compensation.
The plan covers all employees who have attained age 18, and most of the eligible employees have elected to participate. Each employees pre-tax contributions
are immediately vested upon participation in the plan. The employees vesting of the Companys matching contribution
is based upon length of service as follows   Years of service

contributions. Employees in active service on the effective date of the plan were granted retroactive service credit for the purpose
of determining their vested percentage. Company matching contributions amounted to $75 in 2014 and $82 in 2013.   - 40 -

Item 5. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures Our management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of December 31, 2014. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the company management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily
applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2014 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded
that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Management Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Management, including our chief executive
officer and our chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013. Based on its assessment and those criteria, management
has concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting There was no change in our internal control
over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15d and 15d-15d of the Exchange
Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information. Not Applicable.   - 43 -
