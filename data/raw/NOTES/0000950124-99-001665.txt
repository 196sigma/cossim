ITEM 8
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The Board of Directors
Engineering Animation, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Engineering Animation, Inc. as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Technology Company
Ventures, LLC, which statements reflect total revenues constituting 11% in 1996
of the related consolidated total. Those statements were audited by other
auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it
relates to data included for Technology Company Ventures, LLC, is based solely
on the report of other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and report of other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors,
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Engineering Animation, Inc. at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                                Ernst & Young LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota

Engineering Animation, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BUSINESS
Engineering Animation, Inc. the Company develops, produces and
sells enterprise-wide software solutions and interactive software products that
address communication, animation and graphics needs of its customers in domestic
and international commercial markets.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements are presented giving retroactive
effect to the Company acquisitions of Technology Company Ventures, LLC
TCV, Cimtech, Inc. Cimtech, Variation Systems Analysis, Inc. VSA,
Transom Technologies, Inc. Transom, and DELTA Industrie Informatik GmbH
DELTA, which have been accounted for as a pooling of interests.
Sense8 which was acquired on June 17, 1998, has been accounted for as a
purchase. The consolidated financial statements include the results of Sense8
since the date of acquisition.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
carried at cost, which approximates market value.
RESTRICTED CASH
Restricted cash consists of cash committed as collateral for the notes
payable to the State of Iowa.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
Short-term investments consist primarily of U.S. Government or
governmental agencies debt securities and high-grade commercial paper.
Short-term investments are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which
approximates market value. The Company classifies its short-term investments as
available-for-sale.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, but applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25
and related interpretations in accounting for its stock plans. Under APB 25,
when the exercise price of an employee stock option equals the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from software products is recognized when an arrangement to
deliver software does not require significant production, modification or
customization and all four basic criteria in the Statement of 
- 38   39
Position 97-2 SOP 97-2, as issued by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, have been met. The four basic criteria are:
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, fee
is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable.
Revenue from service and customer support contracts is deferred and
recognized ratably over the period the services are provided.
Revenue is recognized in our software and interactive divisions based
upon labor and other costs incurred and progress to completion on development
contracts. Unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue earned but not yet
billable based on terms of the contract. Billings are made based on milestones
or as otherwise provided for in the contracts.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts
receivable. This risk is partially mitigated due to the large number, diversity
and financial strength of entities comprising the Company customer base.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
The Company international operations represent an increasingly
substantial portion of its overall operating results. Sales offices are located
in France, Italy, England and Malaysia. Sales and operating offices are located
in Germany.
During 1998, foreign revenues were $239 million or 22% of total
revenues compared with $128 million or 18% of total revenues in 1997 and $83
million or 17% of total revenues in 1996.
The Company international operations are subject to a number of risks
including currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in foreign governments
and their laws and policies, and expropriation or requirements of local or
shared ownership. The Company believes that the geographic dispersion of its
sales and assets and liabilities partially mitigates these risks. Certain
international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS
The functional currencies of the Company foreign subsidiaries are
considered to be the respective subsidiary local currency.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is carried at cost. Depreciation of property and
equipment and amortization of capital lease assets are computed principally by
the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives   years
- 7 years
Leasehold  of term of lease or life of asset                   - 39   40
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
The Company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. The capitalization
of these costs begins when a product technological feasibility has been
established and ends when the product is available for general release to
customers. The Company amortizes these costs over an estimated economic useful
life of three years or on the ratio of current revenue to total projected
product revenues, whichever is greater. Amortization expense was $521,000 219,000 and $194,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under
this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxes
are recorded based on enacted tax laws and tax rates. Changes in enacted tax
rates will be reflected in the tax provision as they occur.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the
combination of dilutive common share equivalents and the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information. Statement 131 superseded Statement No. 14, Financial
Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise. Statement 131 establishes
standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about
operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those
enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim
financial reports. Statement 131 also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.
The adoption of Statement 131 did not affect the Company results of operations
or financial position, but did affect its disclosure of segment information.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
As of January 1, 1998 the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Statement 130
established new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and
its components; however, the adoption of this Statement had no impact on the
Company net income or stockholders' equity. Statement 130 requires the foreign
currency translation adjustments, which prior to adoption were reported
separately in stockholders' equity, to be included in other comprehensive
income. Prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
requirements of Statement 130.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain prior year financial information has been reclassified to
conform to the 1998 financial statements presentation.

2. ACQUISITIONS
On December 22, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of DELTA.
The Company acquired DELTA by purchasing all of the outstanding shares of
DELTA capital stock of six stockholders. In connection with the acquisition,
the Company issued approximately 557,000 shares of common stock with a value of
approximately $240 million. The acquisition of DELTA by the Company was
accounted for as a pooling of interests.
On September 22, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of VSA.
The Company issued approximately 542,000 shares of common stock in exchange for
all of the outstanding common stock of VSA in a transaction valued at
approximately $260 million. This acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of
interests.
On September 22, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of
Transom. The Company issued approximately 192,000 shares of common stock in
exchange for all of the outstanding preferred and common stock of Transom in a
transaction valued at approximately $130 million. This acquisition was
accounted for as a pooling of interests.
On November 26, 1997, the Company acquired Cimtech. The Company issued
approximately 185,000 shares of common stock in exchange for all of the
outstanding common stock of Cimtech in a transaction valued at approximately
$60 million. This acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests.
On November 25, 1997, the Company acquired Rosetta, in two separate
transactions valued at approximately $255 million. The Company acquired a
controlling interest in Rosetta through a merger with TCV by exchanging
approximately 630,000 shares of common stock for the outstanding member equity
of TCV. This phase was accounted for as a pooling of interests. It subsequently
acquired the remaining minority interest in Rosetta by issuing approximately
309,000 shares of common stock. The minority interest in the acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method.
The following table shows the separate results of operations for the
companies acquired in 1998 and 1997 as a pooling of interest for the periods
prior to the acquisitions. The operations of acquired companies are included as
the Company operations starting in the quarter of acquisition.

On June 17, 1998, the Company exchanged approximately 158,000 shares of
its common stock for all of the outstanding stock of Sense8, a privately held
developer and distributor of interactive, real-time 3D and virtual reality tools
and applications. Based on the value of EAI stock and options exchanged, the
transaction, including transaction costs and net liabilities assumed, was valued
at approximately $97 million.

operations as if Sense8 had been acquired as of the beginning of the periods
presented.           in thousands, except per share data

The Sense8 purchase consideration was allocated to the intangible
assets based on fair values as follows     in thousands

Goodwill and other intangible assets               4,107
Total purchase consideration                $9,667
Management estimated that $19 million of the purchase price
represented purchased in-process research and development IPR that had not
yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.
Accordingly, this amount was expensed following consummation of the acquisition.
The value assigned to IPR was determined by identifying research projects in
areas for which technological feasibility had not been achieved. The value was
determined by estimating the costs to develop the IPR into commercially viable
products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects, and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rate
included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the
successful development of the IPR projects.
To determine the value of the developed technology $36 million, the
expected future cash flows of the existing developed technologies were
discounted taking into account the characteristics and applications of the
product, the size of existing markets, growth rates of existing and future
markets as well as an evaluation

Management estimated that $17 million of the purchase price
represented purchased IPR that had not yet reached technological feasibility
and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was expensed in 1997
following consummation of the acquisition. The value assigned to IPR was
determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological
feasibility had not been achieved. The value was determined by estimating the
costs to develop the IPR into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects, and discounting the net cash flows
back to their present value. The discount rate included a factor that took into
account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the IPR
projects.
To determine the value of the developed technology $22 million, the
expected future cash flows of the existing developed technologies were
discounted taking into account the characteristics and applications of the
products, the size of existing markets, growth rates of existing and future
markets as well as an evaluation 
- 43   44
of past and anticipated product-life cycles. Developed technologies and
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired from Rosetta are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the respective useful lives of
the assets of five years.
The purchase price allocations for both the Sense8 and Rosetta purchase
transactions differ from what was originally reported by the Company. The
Company allocated the costs to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed,
including IPR, based on their estimated fair values using valuation methods
believed to be appropriate at the time. The Company expensed the IPR in the
period in which it consummated the acquisition, in accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business
Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method. The Company expensed IPR
of $91 million in the second quarter of 1998 related to Sense8 and $56 million
in the fourth quarter of 1997 related to Rosetta.
Subsequent to the Securities and Exchange Commission letter to the
AICPA dated September 9, 1998, regarding its views on IPR, the Company has
re-evaluated its IPR charges on the Sense8 and Rosetta acquisitions.
Consequently, the Company has revised the purchase price allocations and
restated the 1997 annual financial statements and the financial statements for
the first three quarters of 1998. The Company has decreased the amount
previously expensed as IPR and increased the amount capitalized as developed
technology and goodwill by $72 million related to Sense8 and $39 million
related to Rosetta. Accordingly, net income for 1997 increased by $39 million
or $36 per share on a diluted basis.
The Company has recorded acquisition costs and non-recurring expenses
of $141 million, $51 million and $62,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

3. NOTE RECEIVABLE
During 1995, the Company entered into a loan agreement whereby the
Company agreed to loan approximately $750,000 to the developer of a building the
Company leases. During 1996, the Company loaned an additional $658,000 to the
developer. The Company began leasing the building in July 1996. Interest, at a
rate of 225% above the U.S. Treasury three-year constant rate, began accruing
and is payable monthly upon commencement of the lease. The principal is due June
2016, unless the developer sells the building to an unaffiliated third party, at
which time the principal and interest accrued to date become immediately due.
The note receivable is collateralized by a second mortgage on the building.                   - 44 -

differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant

December 31, 1998 and 1997 are as follows in thousands                      DECEMBER 31,

48     At December 31, 1998, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards
of $74 million for federal income tax purposes that expire in the years 2003
through 2017. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code restricts the annual
utilization of the NOL carryforwards incurred prior to a change in ownership.
Such a change in ownership occurred in connection with TCV acquisition of the
majority interest of Rosetta in 1995 and will limit the Company ability to
utilize the NOL carryforwards existing when Rosetta was acquired by TCV. Changes
in ownership also occurred in connection with the Company 1997 acquisitions of
TCV and Cimtech and its 1998 acquisitions of Sense8 and Transom. The Company
does not believe that its utilization of the carryforwards for the companies
acquired in 1997 and 1998 will be significantly limited under Section 382.
Unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries amounted to approximately
$12 million at December 31, 1998. Those earnings are considered to be
indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. or state income
taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the
form of dividends or otherwise, the Company will be subject to both U.S. income
taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes
payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of
unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of
the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation; however, income
tax credits will substantially offset any resulting tax liability.
9. CAPITAL STOCK, STOCK SPLIT AND STOCK OPTIONS
CAPITAL STOCK
The Company adopted a stockholders rights plan effective at the time of
the initial public offering. Under the plan, each share of common stock has
associated with it one preferred share purchase right. The terms of these rights
are set forth in the Rights Agreement between the Company and First Chicago
Trust Company of New York.
STOCK SPLIT
The Company completed a three-for-two stock split in the form of a
stock dividend, paid to stockholders of record as of February 12, 1998.
Accordingly, all share, per share, weighted average share and stock option
information for periods prior to the split, has been restated to reflect the
split.
STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has stock option arrangements with various directors and
officers and other employees. The options are generally granted at fair market
value. The options generally vest over four or five years and must be exercised
no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
In 1994, the Company issued non-qualified options to purchase 532,032
shares of common stock for $133 per share to two officer/stockholders. These
options are not part of the 1994 Stock Option Plan described below. In 1998,
268,840 of these options were exercised. The remaining options are fully vested
and remain exercisable through June 2009.
During 1994, the Company adopted the Engineering Animation, Inc. 1994
Stock Option Plan providing for issuance of either incentive or non-qualified
options to employees based upon management discretion. The Company has reserved
1,785,000 shares of common stock for issuance under this Plan.
In February 1995, the Company issued non-plan/non-qualified options to
purchase 221,250 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $267 to $800
per share to five executives. Of these options, 3,375 were exercised in 1998 and
the rest are fully vested and remain exercisable through February 2010.                    -48-
49     In January 1996, the Company adopted a Non-Employee Directors Option
Plan. Each non-employee director receives an annual grant of 7,500 non-qualified
options under this Plan. The Company has reserved 90,000 shares of common stock
for issuance under this Plan.
During 1997, the Company adopted the Engineering Animation, Inc. 1997
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan providing for issuance of non-qualified options
to employees based upon management discretion. During 1998, the Company amended
the Plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance by 600,000. The
Company has reserved 1,200,000 shares of common stock for issuance under this
Plan.
In June 1998, the Company acquired Sense8, which had a stock option
plan 1997 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan and two individual stock option
agreements. The Company has assumed Sense8 outstanding obligations under the
Plan and the agreements. Incentive and non-qualified options had been issued
under the Plan. The Company has reserved 6,226 shares of common stock for
issuance under the Plan. Non-qualified options had been issued under the two
individual stock option agreements. The Company has reserved 5,078 shares of
common stock for issuance under these agreements.
In September 1998, the Company acquired Transom, which had a stock
option plan Transom, Inc. 1996 Equity Compensation Plan. The Company has
assumed Transom outstanding obligations under this Plan. All options became
immediately exercisable as a result of the acquisition. Incentive and
non-qualified options had been issued under the Plan. The Company has reserved
42,681 shares of common stock for issuance under this Plan.

The weighted-average remaining contractual life of these options is 88
years.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by Statement 123, which also requires that the information be
determined as if the Company has accounted for its employee stock options
granted subsequent to December 31, 1994 under the fair value method of that
Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively: risk-free interest rates of
50%, 57% and 57%; a dividend yield of 00%; volatility factors of the
expected market price of the Company common stock of 063, 034 and 036; and
a weighted-average expected life of the option of 54, 40 and 40 years.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair market value
of the options is amortized to expense net of related pro forma tax benefits
over the options' vesting period. The Company pro forma information follows in thousands, except per share data     YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

11. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company has a 401k plan that covers the majority of U.S. based
employees who meet the minimum age requirement. The Company matches one-half of
the employee contribution up to a maximum Company contribution of the first 4%
of the employee compensation. The Company matched expense for 1998, 1997 and
1996 was approximately $469,000, $220,000 and $130,000, respectively.
12. FAIR MARKET VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments     Notes Receivable--the carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for
the note receivable approximates its fair value since it has a floating rate of
interest.
Long-Term Debt--the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for
the Company bank notes payable approximate their fair values as they bear
variable rates of interest. The Company believes that the municipal notes,
issued to the Company to encourage and facilitate expansion and increased
employment, approximate their fair values as they were negotiated and issued in
the latter half of 1997. The prime lending rate in 1998 approximated the rate in
1997 and, accordingly, the fair value change would be immaterial.
13. MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company revenue is generated from a significant customer base in
diversified industries across different geographic areas. A major customer is
defined as one that individually represents more than 10% of                    -51-
52 revenues in any year. Revenue from one customer represented 13% in 1998, 10% in
1997 and 14% in 1996. Another customer represented 13% in 1997, a third customer
represented 10% in 1997 and 12% in 1996 and a fourth customer represented 10% in
1996. Management believes the allowances for doubtful accounts is adequate to
cover any potential credit risks.
14. QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following table sets forth selected quarterly financial information
for 1998 and 1997. Operating expenses include acquisition costs and
non-recurring expenses of $45 million, $22 million, $57 million and $17
million for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31,
1998. Acquisition costs and non-recurring expenses for the year ended December
31, 1998 total $141 million. Operating expenses include acquisition costs and
non-recurring expenses of $14,000 in the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and
September 30, 1997 and $50 million for the quarter ended December 31, 1997.
Acquisition costs and non-recurring expenses for the year ended December 31,
1997 total $51 million. The Company believes that all necessary adjustments
have been included to present fairly the selected quarterly information. in thousands except per share data                     AUDITED

53 15. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has two segments: the Software Division and the 
Interactive Division.
The Software Division develops, produces and sells a variety of
enterprise-wide process management, collaboration, communication and analysis
software solutions for major manufacturing corporations. Our solutions enable
users to perform sophisticated product visualizations, digital prototyping and
engineering design and analysis tasks across extended enterprises. The solutions
are platform independent and interface seamlessly with most popular CAD/CAE/CAM
and PDM systems. Customers use the solutions with their existing hardware and
software to improve their product quality while reducing errors, cost and time
to market.
The Interactive Division produces interactive multimedia products for
use in the games, consumer, education, business training and litigation markets.
Its 3D products include animations for trial attorneys, pharmaceutical
companies, manufacturers, and producers of entertainment and educational
programming. The customers include toy companies, museums, computer game
publishers and medical device manufacturers.
The accounting policies of the divisions are the same as those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies. Interest income or expense is
allocated entirely to corporate. The related debt is not allocated to the
division and remains on corporate books. The Company evaluates performance based
on profit or loss before income taxes, not including acquisition costs and
non-recurring expenses.
Because of the distinction in the products, each division is managed
separately, has its own strategic and marketing plan and serves different
customers. The following amounts reflect these policies                    -53-

16. REPORTING THE COSTS OF START-UP ACTIVITIES
In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position 98-5 SOP 98-5, Reporting the Costs of Start-Up
Activities. Which requires that costs related to start-up activities be
expensed as incurred. Prior to 1998, the Company capitalized its organization
costs associated with setting up or acquiring new subsidiaries. The Company
adopted the provisions of SOP 98-5 early in 1998. The effect of adoption of SOP
98-5 was to decrease 1998 income before income taxes by $107,000.
17. LEGAL MATTERS
The Company has learned that complaints purporting to be class action 
lawsuits on behalf of shareholders who purchased EAI common stock between
February 19, 1998 and February 17, 1999 were filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Iowa against it and certain of its executive
officers. The complaints allege various violations of federal securities laws
and seek unspecified damages. Based upon the information set forth in the
complaints, the outcome of these matters are currently not determinable. The 
Company believes that the allegations are totally without merit and intends to 
oppose the actions vigorously.
