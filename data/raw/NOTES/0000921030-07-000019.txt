Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
MITY Enterprises, Inc.:
Orem, UT
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MITY
Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of March 31, 2007 and
2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2007.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of MITY Enterprises, Inc. and
subsidiaries at March 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 1,
2006 the Company changed its method of accounting for share-based payment
arrangements to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.

MITY ENTERPRISES, INC. - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2007 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
MITY Enterprises, Inc. the Company designs and manufactures multipurpose
room furniture, healthcare seating and fencing and markets these products in
niche markets. In addition, the Company continues to pursue acquisitions of
product lines or companies that will be complementary to the Company
businesses. The Company markets its products throughout the United States,
Canada and in certain foreign countries.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of
MITY Enterprises, Inc. and all wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries
for which the Company exercises control. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments which have an
original maturity not greater than three months.
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES
Debt securities, which consist of corporate bonds and government agency
securities, are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at their
fair value. When the fair value of available-for-sale securities differs from
the amortized cost, the resulting unrealized gain or loss is recorded as a
component of comprehensive income. The amortization of premiums and discounts
on debt securities in this category are included in investment income and
reflected in the net carrying amount of the debt securities. The cost of
securities sold during the period is based on the specific identification
method. Interest on securities in this category are included in investment
income. As of March 31, 2007, the Company did not have any available-for-sale
securities. As of March 31, 2006, the Company had unrealized holding losses
on available-for-sale securities of $6,000. These losses were related to
fluctuations in interest rates and were not considered to be other than
temporary losses.
The contractual maturities of the available-for-sale securities held are
summarized below March 31,                          2006

$103,000 and $225,000 as of March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively See Note 4,
Impairment of Assets.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to operations as incurred, whereas major replacements and improvements
are capitalized and subsequently depreciated. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Depreciation and amortization on the Company property and equipment are
provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets as follows                        Estimated Useful
Life in years
Machinery and equipment              3 to 10
Furniture and fixtures               3 to 5
Leasehold improvements               2 to 15
Buildings and improvements               30 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Company reviews annually the carrying value of its goodwill during the
first quarter of each fiscal year. The goodwill arose from its acquisitions
of Broda Enterprises and Versipanel. During the quarter ended June 30, 2006,
the Company reviewed the goodwill related to the Broda and Versipanel
acquisitions and determined that there was no impairment. This review is
performed using estimates of future cash flows. If the carrying value of the
goodwill is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the
amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its fair value.
During the years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, the change in the carrying
value of the goodwill is related to foreign currency translation gains. The
Company recorded an intangible asset of $85,000 net of $5,000 in accumulated
amortization related to a license agreement entered into during the year
ended March 31, 2007 for the Company dance floor product line which is
included in other assets. The term of this license agreement extends through
the life of the patent which expires in June 2016. For the year ended March
31, 2007, the Company amortized $5,000 related to this intangible asset. The
Company anticipates annual amortization expense related to this intangible
asset of $12,000.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin
SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition, as revised by SAB No. 104. Sales are
recorded when title passes and collectibility is reasonably assured under its
various shipping terms. Revenue is normally recognized upon shipment of goods
to customers. In certain circumstances revenue is not recognized until the
goods are received by the customer based on the terms of the sale agreement.
Discounts directly related to the sale are recorded as a reduction to net
sales.
SHIPPING COSTS
In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 00-10, Accounting
for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, the Company classifies shipping
costs billed to customers as revenue.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and cash equivalents.
In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit terms to its
customers. Accordingly, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses which, when
realized, have been within the range of management expectations.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. The carrying amount
reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and line of credit approximates
fair value because of the immediate, short-term maturity, or variable rate
nature of these financial instruments.
INCOME TAXES
The Company uses an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and
reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary
differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as reported for financial
statement purposes and income tax purposes. The undistributed earnings of the
Canadian operation are permanently reinvested.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Effective April 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires that the fair
value compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be
recognized in financial statements. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair
value of the award, and is recognized over the employee requisite service
period. The fair value of the Company stock options is estimated using a
Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Company adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective
transition method and accordingly, prior years have not been restated. Under
this method, stock-based compensation cost is recognized beginning April 1,
2006 for all options granted after the date of adoption as well as the
unvested portion of previously granted options based on the estimated fair
value. Prior to April 1, 2006 the Company accounted for employee stock option
grants using the intrinsic method in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
included disclosures of pro forma information in its footnotes to the
consolidated financial statements. The Company elected to adopt the
alternative transition method provided in the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB Staff Position No. 123R-3, Transition Election to Accounting for
the Tax Effects of the Share-based Payment Awards, for calculating the tax
effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123R. The
alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the
beginning balance of the Additional Paid-In Capital APIC pool related to the
tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the
subsequent APIC pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax
effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon
adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Pro forma net income and pro forma net income per
share disclosed in Note 8, Common Stock Options, were determined using a
Black-Scholes option valuation model. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R
resulted in additional compensation expense of $307,000 in the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2007.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates
subject to change include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, the
reserve for obsolete inventory, accruals for warranty expense, goodwill and
intangible assets, reserve on notes receivable, litigation reserves, and
valuation of the assets related to its discontinued next generation table
line see Note 4, Impairment of Assets. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets which requires that all long-lived assets to be disposed
of by sale be carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost
to sell, and that depreciation cease to be recorded on such assets. The
Company periodically reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets for
impairment. An asset is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows
are less than the carrying amount of the asset. In the event the carrying
amount of such asset is considered not recoverable, the asset is adjusted to
its fair value. Fair market value is determined primarily using the
anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk
involved. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are
considered held and used until disposed of. Due to the decision by the board
of directors in January 2005 to discontinue the next generation table project,
the Company impaired certain long-term assets during the quarter ended March
31, 2005. This resulted in an impairment charge of $22 million, including
$20 million related to fixed assets and $02 million related to other
intangible assets See Note 4, Impairment of Assets. There were no additional
long-lived assets which were considered impaired as of March 31, 2007 and
2006.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation
adjustments, unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities, and net income.
ACCRUED WARRANTY
The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time
revenue is recognized. This warranty obligation is affected by failure rates,
the introduction of new products, and the costs of material and labor to
repair or replace the product. The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of
its accrual for warranty expense based upon historical warranty rates and
anticipated future warranty rates. Activity associated with the accrued
warranty is as follows Year Ended March 31,             2007    2006    2005
Balance at beginning of period       $470,000  $439,000  $415,000
Accruals for warranties issued
during the period             865,000   900,000   661,000
Settlements made during the period     850,000  869,000  637,000
Balance at end of period          $485,000  $470,000  $439,000
FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS
The financial statements of the Company foreign subsidiary is measured using
the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S. dollars at year-end rates of exchange and results of
operations are translated at average rates for the year. Gains and losses
resulting from these translations are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The
Company also recognizes foreign currency gains and losses for transactions
related to its foreign subsidiary as well as note payments from its Australian
dealer. For the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, currency gains
losses totaled $36,000. $53,000, and $126,000, respectively.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Patent expenses,
including legal expenses, are expensed in the period in which they are
incurred and are generally not significant. Patent expenses are included in
research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of income.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted effect of all common shares
issued and outstanding, and is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation plus the number
of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all
potentially dilutive common shares outstanding. The Company excludes equity
instruments from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares
outstanding if the effect of including such instruments is antidilutive to
earnings per share. The following table sets forth the computation of basic
and diluted earnings per share for each of the past three fiscal years Year Ended March 31,            2007     2006     2005

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs. SFAS No.
151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to
clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be
recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the
criterion of so abnormal. In addition, this Statement requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based
on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company adopted
SFAS No. 151 on April 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 did not have any
impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchange of Nonmonetary
Assets. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary
assets. It eliminates the exception from the fair value measurement for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a
general exception for exchanges that do not have a commercial substance. This
Statement specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if
the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a
result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for annual periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company adopted SFAS No. 153 on April 1,
2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 did not have any impact on the Company
consolidated financial statements.
In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.
SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial
statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to
determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the
change. SFAS No. 154 also requires that retrospective application of a change
in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change.
Indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in
the period of the accounting change. SFAS No. 154 further requires a change
in depreciation, amortization or depletion method for long-lived,
non-financial assets to be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate
affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December 31, 2005. The Company adopted SFAS No. 154 on April 1, 2006.
The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have any impact on the Company
consolidated financial statements.
In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. FIN 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in
accordance with FASB No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under FIN 48,
tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when
it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by
the tax authorities. Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be
measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely
of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a tax authority that has full
knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. FIN 48 also revises
disclosure requirements to include an annual tabular reconciliation of
unrecognized tax benefits. The provision of this interpretation are required
to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company
will be required to apply the provisions of FIN 48 to all tax positions upon
initial adoption with any cumulative effect adjustment to be recognized as an
adjustment to retained earnings.  The Company is required to adopt FIN 48 for
its fiscal year beginning April 1, 2007. The Company does not expect the
adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements,
which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and
expands disclosure regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007, on a prospective basis. The Company does not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material effect on its consolidated
financial statements.
In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB No. 108,
Financial Statements - Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. SAB No.
108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of prior-year
uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements
in the current year financial statements. SAB No. 108 requires registrants to
quantify misstatements using both the income statement and balance sheet
approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that,
when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is
material. SAB No. 108 is effective for years ending after November 15, 2006
and the adoption had no impact on the Company consolidated financial
statements.
During 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 06-3,
How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities
Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That Is, Gross versus Net
Presentation. This Issue addresses the presentation in the income statement
of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities
including but not limited to sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes.
The Task Force reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes within the
scope of this issue on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs
or a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that
should be disclosed pursuant to APB Opinion 22. EITF Issue No. 06-3 is
effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company
currently presents such taxes on a net basis and does not expect the adoption
of EITF Issue No. 06-3 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial
statements.

4.   IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
During a meeting of the Company board of directors on January 25, 2005, the
board decided to discontinue funding the Company initiative to develop its
next generation table. The decision was made based on the difficulties
encountered and additional expenses required to achieve a consistent,
repeatable manufacturing process. At this time, the decision was also made to
redirect some of the resources previously focused on the next generation table
project towards using the same technology and equipment for other products
that do not require the same level of precision as tables. Currently, the
Company is using these assets for the production of its new fence product
line.
As a result, during the quarter ending March 31, 2005, in accordance with SFAS
No. 144, the Company realized an impairment on some of the assets involved in
that project to reduce their carrying amounts to their estimated fair value.
As per SFAS No. 144, the fair value was determined by the amount at which the
assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing
parties. The Company utilized an outside specialist to establish the fair
value of the assets. The impairment totaled $2,226,000 and consisted of
$1,999,000 in impairment of fixed assets and $227,000 in impairment of other
intangible asset related to license agreements.
In connection with the decision to discontinue the next generation table line,
it was determined that the value of the inventory associated with the project
was less than its cost. In accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin 43
ARB 43, this inventory was revalued at market value through a reserve which
resulted in an adjustment down in the value of inventory of $324,000. This
charge was included in the cost of products sold.
The fair value of the assets previously associated with the next generation
table project that were redirected on other processes as of March 31, 2005,
consisted of $2,528,000 in building, $1,045,000 for equipment, and $272,000 in
inventory. The Company believes that it will be able to fully realize the
value of these assets.
5. NOTES RECEIVABLE AND INVESTMENT IN SUBSIDIARY
In 2002, the Company acquired a 50 percent interest in a startup development
company. On September 30, 2004, the Company sold its 50 percent equity
ownership interest in the startup development company to the other 50 percent
owner. The Company exchanged its ownership interest for an exclusive license
for furniture products and selected other products, release of all royalty
obligations on existing and future products, and other considerations. The
Company retained most of the tangible assets and liabilities of the startup
development company including cash, inventory, fixed assets, and accounts
payable. Due to the decision by the board of directors in January 2005 to
discontinue funding the Company initiative to develop its next generation
table, the Company impaired certain of the remaining assets See Note 4,
Impairment of Assets.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement
with a dealer for the Company multipurpose room furniture in Australia and
entered into a note receivable for $365,000. This note, which bears interest
at the prime rate, requires monthly payments of interest and principal in the
amount of $8,000 US$ and is being amortized over a six and one half year
period. The note is secured by all of the assets of the dealership and by
personal guarantees from the principals of the dealership. At March 31, 2007
and 2006, the gross value of this note receivable was $16,000 and $80,000,
respectively. At March 31, 2007, all of this note receivable is current and
is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of March 31,
2007, the dealer was current on payments on this note receivable.
As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has another note receivable for
$16,000 and $26,000, respectively, of which $10,000 is current as of each date
and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
6. LINE OF CREDIT
On August 21, 2006, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement and Promissory
Note Loan between the Company and Zions First National Bank to provide an
unsecured revolving line of credit of up to $50 million, bearing interest at
U.S. Prime minus 125 percent 700 percent at March 31, 2007. The Loan
expires on September 1, 2008. The Loan may be prepaid or terminated at the
Company option at anytime without penalty. Any outstanding principal
balance together with any accrued but unpaid interest or fees will be due in
full at maturity. The Loan contains certain negative and affirmative
covenants. As of March 31, 2007, the Company is in compliance with all debt
covenants See Note 14, Subsequent Event. As of March 31, 2007, the Company
had $3,151,000 of borrowings on the line of credit with $1,849,000 in
available capacity.
The Company wholly-owned subsidiary, Broda Enterprises, has a line of
credit, bearing interest at Canadian prime 600 percent and 550 at March 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively which is secured by a General Security Agreement,
an assignment of insurance and guarantees by the Company. The limit on this
line is $1,212,000 US$ and $857,000 US$ at March 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. At March 31, 2007, $589,000 US$ was outstanding on this line
with $623,000 US$ in available capacity. At March 31, 2006, no balance was
outstanding. Among other restrictions, this credit facility requires the
maintenance of certain financial ratios and levels of working capital. As of
March 31, 2007, the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants See Note
14, Subsequent Event.
7. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following March 31,                 2007       2006
Accrued payroll and payroll taxes   $ 1,887,000    $ 1,080,000
Accrued warranty              485,000      470,000
Deferred revenue              485,000      492,000
Tax payable                 85,000      88,000
Other                   624,000      297,000
$ 3,566,000    $ 2,427,000
8. COMMON STOCK OPTIONS
The Company stock-based compensation consists of three stock incentive
plans, the 1990 Stock Option Plan the 1990 Plan, the 1997 Stock Incentive
Plan the 1997 Plan and the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan the 2006 Plan.
The Company authorized and reserved 750,000 shares of common stock for
issuance under the 1990 Plan, 900,000 shares of common stock for issuance
under the 1997 Plan, and 300,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the
2006 Plan. No options remain unexercised under the 1990 Plan and the plan
expired under its own terms during the year ended March 31, 2007. The
purchase price for the shares under the plans is equal to the fair value of
the common stock at the date the options are granted as determined by the
closing price listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market except for shareholders
holding more than ten percent of the outstanding stock, whose options are
issued at a ten percent premium to the then current market value.
Effective April 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified
prospective transition method. Under this transition method, stock-based
compensation cost recognized beginning April 1, 2006 includes compensation
cost for all share-based payments not yet vested as of April 1, 2006 based on
the grant date fair value estimated had the Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 123. In addition, this transition method requires any share-based
payments granted after April 1, 2006 be accounted for in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123R.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R
resulted in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $307,000. Of this
amount, $107,000 was included in cost of products sold, $69,000 in selling
expenses, $98,000 in general and administrative expenses, and $33,000 in
research and development expenses. Stock-based compensation expense net of
expected forfeitures was recognized for only those awards expected to vest on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates
were estimated based on past experience. The stock-based compensation expense
associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R reduced net operating income and
net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 by $307,000, and basic and
diluted earnings per share by $008 and $009 per share, respectively. As of
March 31, 2007, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested stock options, net of expected forfeitures, was $595,000, and is
expected to be recognized through the year ending March 31, 2012. The total
income tax benefit related to share-based compensation for the year ended
March 31, 2007 which is recorded in additional paid-in capital was $23,000,
and was shown as a cash flow from operating and financing activities in the
consolidated statements of cash flows. The $307,000 stock-based compensation
expense is also included in cash flows from operating activities as an
adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating
activities. The Company consolidated financial statements for prior periods
have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS No. 123R.
Prior to April 1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation
under the intrinsic value method outlined in APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly,
no compensation cost has been recognized for stock-based compensation for the
prior years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005. Had compensation cost of the

were granted, respectively. No options were granted during the year ended
March 31, 2006. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2007 and 2005, respectively:
expected volatility of 23 percent and 41 percent, risk free interest rates of
482 percent and 331 percent, an expected annual dividend yield of zero
percent, and expected lives of one to four years. The average risk-free
interest rate was determined using the U.S. Treasury rate in effect as of the
date of the grant, based on the expected term of the option. The expected
term of the options was determined using historical data. The expected price
volatility was determined using a weighted average of historical volatility of
the Company stock price over the corresponding expected option life. The
weighted average fair value per share of options issued during the years ended
March 31, 2007 and 2005 was $524 and $472, respectively.
