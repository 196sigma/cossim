ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The accompanying consolidated financial statements of TLC Vision Corporation have been
prepared by management in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. The significant accounting policies have been set out in Note 2 in the consolidated
financial statements. These statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting.
Accordingly, a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future
events. Therefore, estimates and approximations have been made using careful judgment. Recognizing
that the Company is responsible for both the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements,
management is satisfied that these financial statements have been prepared within reasonable limits
of materiality under United States generally accepted accounting principles. During the year ended December31, 2007, the Board of Directors had an Audit Committee
consisting of four non-management directors. The committee met with management and the auditors to
review any significant accounting, internal control and auditing matters and to review and finalize
the annual financial statements of the Company along with the report of independent registered
public accounting firm prior to the submission of the financial statements to the Board of
Directors for final approval. The financial information throughout the text of this Annual Report is consistent with the
information presented in the financial statements. The Companys accounting procedures and related systems of internal control are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that its assets are safeguarded and its financial records are
reliable. 42 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders
TLC Vision Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TLC Vision Corporation as of
December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of TLC Vision Corporation at December31, 2007 and
2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for depreciation and stock-based compensation effective January1, 2006. Also as
discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for income tax uncertainties effective January1, 2007. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, TLC Vision Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March12,
2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

tabular amounts in thousands, except per share amounts 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS TLC Vision Corporation is an eye care services company dedicated to improving lives through
improving vision by providing high-quality care directly to patients and as a partner with their
doctors and facilities. The majority of the Companys revenues come from owning and operating
refractive centers that employ laser technologies to treat common refractive vision disorders such
as myopia nearsightedness, hyperopia farsightednessand astigmatism. In its doctor services
segment, the Company furnishes doctors and medical facilities with mobile or fixed site access to
refractive and cataract surgery equipment, supplies, technicians and diagnostic products, as well
as owns and manages single-specialty ambulatory surgery centers. In its eye care segment, the
Company provides franchise opportunities to independent optometrists under its Vision Source brand
and is a minority owner of OccuLogix, Inc. OccuLogix, a company pursuing treatments for
selected eye diseases. In 2002, the Company formed a joint venture with OccuLogix, Inc. formerly Vascular Sciences
Corporation to create a partnership focused on specific eye diseases including dry age-related
macular degeneration AMD, glaucoma and dry-eye. As a result of various equity transactions
including the initial public offering of OccuLogix, Inc. OccuLogix during 2004, the Company
began including the results of operations of OccuLogix in its consolidated statement of operations
beginning in December2004. In April2006, TLCVision sold 08million shares of its OccuLogix
common stock and recorded a gain of $14million. After the sale of stock, the Company owned less
than 50% of OccuLogix. Effective April1, 2006, the Company deconsolidated OccuLogix and began
accounting for its investment in OccuLogix under the equity method. At December31, 2007, the
Company owned 188million shares or 33% of OccuLogixs common stock. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its majority-owned
subsidiaries and all variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Discontinued Operations During 2007, the Company completed the divestiture of two ambulatory surgical centers, which
were part of the Companys doctor services business. The results for these components are
accounted for as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for the years
presented herein. Summarized, combined condensed statements of income for discontinued operations

The above summarized, combined balance sheet for discontinued operations include $101million
of goodwill and intangibles. Variable Interest Entities The Company consolidates physician practices that are managed but not owned by the Company
because the Company is the primary beneficiary. The consolidation of the physician practices
results in an increase in revenues and cost of revenues for refractive centers, however it has no
material impact on total assets, gross profit or operating income and no impact on net income. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid short-term investments with original
maturities of 90days or less. Short-Term Investments During the year-ended December31, 2007, the Company utilized all of its short-term
investments to partially fund a repurchase of 20million shares its common stock see Note 15,
Share Repurchase. As of December31, 2006, short-term investments included auction rate
securities, which were available to support the Companys current operations. These investments
were classified as available-for-sale securities and were recorded at fair value. There were no
unrealized gains or losses associated with these auction rate securities due to the short time
period between interest rate reset dates. All of the auction rate securities had contractual
maturities of more than five years. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in,
first-out basis. Investments The Company has certain investments in equity securities. Investments are accounted for using
the equity method if the Company has significant influence, but not control, over an investee. All
other equity investments, in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant
influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Under the cost method of accounting,
investments that do not have a quoted market price non-marketable equity securities are carried
at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value and additional
investment activity. Fixed Assets Fixed assets are recorded at cost or the present value of future minimum lease payments for
assets accounted for as a capital lease. The costs of additions, improvements and major
replacements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation
is provided on the straight-line basis and at rates intended to represent the assets productive
lives as follows   
Buildings
- 40years   Computer equipment and software
- three to four years   Furniture, fixtures and equipment
- seven years   Laser and medical equipment
- five to seven years   Leasehold improvements
- shorter of useful life or initial term of the lease   Vehicles and other
- five years 49 Prior to January1, 2006, the Company recorded depreciation using the 25% declining balance
method for certain fixed asset categories see Note 3, Accounting Changes. Goodwill The Company tests for impairment at least annually, on November30, and more frequently if
changes in circumstances or events indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment has
occurred. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets consist primarily of practice management agreements PMAs, deferred
contract rights, and trade names. PMAs represent the cost of obtaining the exclusive right to
manage eye care centers and secondary care centers in affiliation with the related physician group
during the term of the respective agreements. Deferred contract rights represent the value of
contracts with affiliated doctors to provide basic access and service. Trade names represent the
value associated with the name of an entity that was acquired by the Company. All identifiable
intangibles with a finite life are amortized using the straight-line method over the respective
estimated useful lives. Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. Medical Malpractice Accruals To mitigate a portion of the risk associated with medical malpractice lawsuits, the Company
maintains insurance for individual malpractice claims with a deductible of $250,000 per claim. The
Company and its insurance carrier review malpractice lawsuits for purposes of establishing ultimate
loss estimates. The Company records reserves to cover the estimated costs of the deductible for
both reported and unreported medical malpractice claims incurred. The estimates are based on the
average monthly claims expense and the estimated average time lag between the performance of a
procedure and notification of a claim. If the number of claims or the cost of settled claims is
higher than the Companys historical experience or if the actual time lag varies from the estimated
time lag, the Company may need to record significant additional expense. Revenue Recognition The Companys refractive centers currently employ different pricing and patient acquisition
strategies depending upon the market. All are based upon the same pricing methodology, which
begins with an entry level price and has logical, technology based upgrades. Pricing is generally
inclusive of all follow up visits and the TLC Lifetime Commitment, although la carte pricing
options are available in certain centers. The Company recognizes refractive revenues when the procedure is performed. Revenue from
refractive centers represents the amount charged to patients for a laser vision correction
procedure, net of discounts, contractual adjustments in certain regions and amounts collected as an
agent of co-managing doctors. Revenue from doctor services represents the amount charged to the customer/surgeon for access
to equipment and technical support based on use, as well as management fees from cataract and
secondary care practices. The Companys eye care segment revenue principally includes optometric
franchising services. Revenues from these services are recognized as the service is rendered or
when the procedure is performed. We offer a portion of our patients at our value-priced centers extended lifetime warranties,
i.e. the TLC Lifetime Commitment. Under applicable accounting rules, 100% of revenues from the
sale of the lifetime warranty are to be deferred and recognized over the life of the contract on a
straight-line basis unless sufficient experience exists to indicate that the costs to provide the
service will be incurred other than on a straight-line basis. We believe we have sufficient
experience to support recognition on other than a straight-line basis. Accordingly, we have
deferred these revenues and are recognizing them over the period in which the future costs of
performing the enhancement procedures are expected to be incurred. When incurred, the Company records sales tax on a net basis. Cost of Revenues 50 Included in cost of revenues are the laser fees payable to laser manufacturers for royalties,
use and maintenance of the lasers, variable expenses for consumables, financing costs, facility
fees as well as center costs associated with personnel and facilities depreciation. Marketing Marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the income tax basis of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the applicable
enacted statutory tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on
the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Foreign Currency Exchange The functional currency of the Companys Canadian operations is the U.S. dollar. The assets
and liabilities of the Companys Canadian operations are maintained in Canadian dollars and
remeasured into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the consolidated balance sheet date
for monetary items and at exchange rates prevailing at the transaction dates for nonmonetary items.
Revenues and expenses are remeasured into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during
the year with the exception of depreciation and amortization, which are translated at historical
exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses are included in net lossincome. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing net income available to common shareholders
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options to purchase common shares
were exercised. In periods in which the inclusion of such instruments is anti-dilutive, the effect
of such securities is not given consideration. Contingent Consideration When the Company enters into agreements that provide for contingent consideration based on
certain predefined targets being met, an analysis is made to determine whether the contingent
consideration represents an additional purchase price obligation or is deemed to be compensation
expense. The accounting treatment if the consideration is determined to be an additional purchase
price payment is to increase the value assigned to the net assets acquired. Where the contingent
consideration is deemed to be compensation, the expense is reflected as an operating expense in the
periods that the service is rendered. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These estimates are reviewed
periodically, and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in income in the period in
which they become known. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications of prior years presentations have been made to conform to the 2007
presentation. Prospective Accounting Pronouncements In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No157,
Fair Value Measurements which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement clarifies how to
measure fair value as permitted under other accounting pronouncements but does not require any new
fair value measurements. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No157 as of January1, 2008.
The Company is currently 51 evaluating the impact of SFAS No157 and has not yet determined the impact on its financial
statements. In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No115, which will become
effective in 2008. SFAS No159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial
liabilities, and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are
otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting
principles. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair
value must be recorded in earnings. The Company will adopt this Statement as of January1, 2008
and is currently evaluating if it will elect the fair value option for any of its eligible
financial instruments and other items. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No51. This Statement will significantly change the
financial accounting and reporting for noncontrolling or minority interests in consolidated
financial statements. SFAS No160 will become effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
December15, 2008. The Company will adopt this Statement as of January1, 2009. Management
anticipates at this time that SFAS No160 may have a significant impact on the financial
accounting and presentation for the Companys various minority interests. However, management
cannot yet determine the magnitude of such impact. In December2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No141R,
Business Combinations, which will become effective for companies during the first annual
reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. This Statement replaces SFAS No141,
Business Combinations. In comparison to current practice in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, the most significant changes to business combination accounting pursuant to SFAS No.
141 Rinclude requirements to   
Recognize, with certain exceptions, 100percent of the fair values of assets acquired,
liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in acquisitions of less than a 100
percent controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the
acquired entity.   
Measure acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination at fair
value on the acquisition date.   
Recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition-date fair values,
with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings.   
Expense, as incurred, acquisition-related costs.   
Capitalize acquisition-related restructuring costs under limited circumstances. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No141R as of January1, 2009 for future
acquisitions. 3. ACCOUNTING CHANGES Segment Reporting Beginning in 2007, the Company reorganized its reporting segments to provide enhanced
transparency of its operational results. The Companys reportable segments are strategic business
units that offer different products and services. They are managed and evaluated separately by the
chief operating decision maker because each business requires different management and marketing
strategies. Effective January1, 2007, the Company has three lines of business and six reportable
segments including Other. Prior year amounts included herein have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation. Refer to Note 22, Segment Information, for further details. Depreciation Method On January1, 2006, the Company changed its depreciation policy for the following asset
classifications: furniture, fixtures and equipment; laser and medical equipment; and vehicles and
other. The Company changed to the straight-line depreciation method from the 25% declining balance
method for these assets. The change was reflected prospectively in the Companys financial
statements both for new assets acquired after January1, 2006 and for assets previously held from
that date forward. Managements decision to change was based on its judgment that straight-line
depreciation provides a better method of reflecting the pattern of consumption of the assets being
depreciated over their estimated useful lives given their characteristics and usage patterns. The
Company has determined that the design and durability of these assets diminishes ratably over time,
and it is therefore preferable to recognize the related cost uniformly over their estimated useful
lives on a straight-line basis. During the year ended December31, 2006, the change decreased
depreciation expense by approximately $08million $07million after tax or $001 per basic and
diluted share. Stock-based Compensation 52 On December16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment,
Statement 123R effective January1, 2006, which is a revision of FASB Statement No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Statement 123. Generally, the approach in Statement
123R is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123R requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized
in the statements of operations based on their fair values on the date of grant. Under Statement
123R, pro forma disclosure is no longer permitted. Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation utilizing the
intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of employee
stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant.
However, stock-based compensation has been included in pro forma disclosures in the financial
statement footnotes in prior periods. Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement 123R using the modified prospective method of application, which requires the Company
to recognize compensation expense on a prospective basis. Therefore, prior period financial
statements have not been restated to recognize compensation expense under the provisions of
Statement 123R. Under this method, in addition to reflecting compensation expense for new
stock-based awards, expense is also recognized to reflect the remaining service period of awards
that had been included in pro forma disclosures in prior periods. Statement 123R also requires
that excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises be reflected as financing cash inflows
and operating cash outflows. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if
Statement 123R had been applied to all outstanding awards for the year ended December31, 2005

In December2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of all
unvested stock options with an exercise price per share of $875 or higher. In accordance with SFAS
No123, the Company recognized the remaining balance of unrecognized compensation cost for the
affected options at the time of modification in the pro forma disclosures. For awards granted prior to the adoption of Statement 123R, the Company uses the attribution
method under FASB Interpretation No28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option Award Plans, to amortize stock-based compensation cost. For awards granted
subsequent to the adoption of Statement 123R, the Company uses the straight-line method to
amortize stock-based compensation cost. 4. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS The Companys strategy includes periodic acquisitions of, or investments in entities that
operate within its chosen markets. During 2007 and 2006, the Company paid a total of approximately
$48million and $78million, respectively, to acquire or invest in several entities, none of
which was individually material. Of the 2007 investment amount, approximately $28million related
to cash paid for the first year earn-out of the 2005 TruVision acquisition, which has been included
in the purchase price allocation. On May30, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with JEGC OCC Corp the Purchaser
for the sale of all of its common shares of OccuLogix. The agreement provided for a two-step sale,
and on June22, 2007, the Company completed its sale of 19million shares of OccuLogixs common
stock for $20million and recorded a gain of $09million. Immediately following the sale of
stock, the Company owned approximately 33% of OccuLogixs outstanding stock. The Company agreed to
sell the remaining shares subject to certain conditions, including financing by the Purchaser. As
of December31, 2007, the Purchaser had not been able to complete the purchase of the Companys
remaining 188million common shares of OccuLogix. The Purchaser retains a non-exclusive right to
purchase the shares under the agreement, which remains in effect subject to both parties rights to
terminate the
agreement. 53 On April11, 2006, the Company sold 08million shares of OccuLogix common stock and recorded
a gain of $14million. After the sale of stock, the Company owned approximately 49% of OccuLogix
outstanding stock. Due to the insignificance of the results of operations of OccuLogix from April
1, 2006 through April11, 2006, the Company deconsolidated OccuLogix effective April1, 2006 and
has accounted for its investment in OccuLogix under the equity method since that date see Note 8,
Investments and Other Assets. 5. RESTRICTED CASH The Company had $11million and $10million of restricted cash as of December31, 2007 and
2006, respectively, to guarantee outstanding bank letters of credit for leases and litigation. 6. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable, net of allowances, consist of the following

The Company is exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable from its various customers   
Refractive centers accounts receivable are due principally from open-access surgeons
who utilize the Companys facilities and staff on a per-use basis pursuant to their
contractual agreement. While the Company offers consumer financing options for LASIK
surgery, the credit risk is borne by the Companys third-party providers who perform an
independent credit evaluation on each potential patient before extending credit.   
Doctor services accounts receivable are generally due from surgeon and medical
facility partners who contract with the Company to use its mobile technology platform.   
Eye care accounts receivable represent fees due from franchisees
pursuant to their franchise agreements. In order to reduce its credit risk, the Company has adopted credit policies, which include the
review of credit limits, and maintains an active collections process. As of December31, 2007
and 2006, the Company had reserves for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances of $20
million and $24million, respectively. The Company does not have a significant exposure to any
individual customer. 7. PREPAID EXPENSES, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS Prepaid expenses, inventory and other current assets consist of the following

As of December31, 2007 and 2006 the Companys equity investment in OccuLogix totaled $0 and
$144million, respectively. As of December31, 2007, the Company owned approximately 33%, or
188million shares, of OccuLogix, Inc.s issued and outstanding common stock with a fair market
value of $15million based on the year-end closing price of OccuLogixs common stock. Since April1, 2006, the Company has accounted for the results of OccuLogix under the equity
method. During the year and nine months ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, OccuLogix
reported the following

Because the Company accounted for its original investment in OccuLogix at historical cost, the
Company must eliminate certain items when it recognizes equity earnings lossesfrom OccuLogix.
For the year ended December31, 2007, the Company recognized $134million of equity losses from
OccuLogix. During the quarter ended December31, 2007, OccuLogix suspended indefinitely its RHEO System
clinical development program in dry age-related macular degeneration, and sold its SOLX subsidiary.
In addition, it announced its intent to significantly reduce headcount and to explore a full range
of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. These actions resulted in OccuLogix
recording significant charges, including an impairment of assets. TLC Vision recorded its share of
the impairment charges as an increase in losses from equity investments and recorded its portion of
the other charges to the extent of its ownership. Under APB 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, an investors
share of losses of an investee may equal or exceed the carrying amount of an investment accounted
for by the equity method. The investor ordinarily should discontinue applying the equity method
when the investment is reduced to zero, and should not provide for additional losses unless the
investor has guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to provide further
financial support for the investee. If the investee subsequently reports net income, the investor
should resume applying the equity method only after its share of that net income equals the share
of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended. As the Companys
investment in OccuLogix reached $0 as of December31, 2007, resulting from continual losses
incurred by OccuLogix, the Company has suspended use of equity method accounting for OccuLogix.
55 OccuLogixs history of losses and financial condition raise substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. 9. GOODWILL The Companys goodwill amount by reporting segment is as follows

2007 Goodwill Impairment During the quarter ended September30, 2007, management explored the disposition of
investments in its remaining seven stand-alone ambulatory surgical centers ASCs. After
discussions with interested strategic and financial buyers, the Company received several
expressions of interest and was in advanced discussions with several third parties. One location
was sold pursuant to these discussions during the quarter ended December31, 2007, and discussions
involving several additional properties are ongoing. Management is continuing to explore possible
divestitures of the remaining ASCs during 2008. In accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, management concluded
that a triggering event had occurred that required an impairment charge to be recorded at September
30, 2007. Due to the triggering event, management measured the impairment loss and recorded a
$124million charge to goodwill during the quarter ended September30, 2007, which was an estimate
based on the fair market value expressed by the interested parties for the ambulatory surgical
centers taken as a whole using the information available at that time. During the quarter ended December31, 2007, management completed its annual internal
forecasting process, which allowed management to calculate implied fair values for each individual
majority and minority owned ASC. Prior to the completion of the internal forecast, such fair value
detail at the individual ASC locations was not available. The implied fair values, calculated using methodologies described under SFAS No142,
indicated that the entire stand-alone ASC was impaired an additional $46million, raising the
total impairment charge for the year ended December31, 2007, to $170million. Management also
concluded that the $170million impairment charge should not only be applied against goodwill
balances of the majority owned ASCs, but should also be applied against the Companys investment
balances, included in other assets, for minority owned ASCs. Such determination was not possible
at September30, 2007 as fair value information at the individual ASC location level was not
available. As a result, management has applied $96million of the total impairment charge to
goodwill, $93million of which is included in discontinued operations for the ASCs that were
disposed of, and $74million to other assets, to reflect the nature of the impairment. In accordance with the SFAS No144, the potential sale of the remaining stand-alone ASCs do
not meet the held for sale criteria necessary for discontinued operation treatment. As a result,
the Company considers the remaining assets held for use, and has reported the results of operations
accordingly for the year ended December31, 2007. Treatment of these potential dispositions will
continue to be evaluated by management. 2007 Acquired Goodwill The Companys strategy includes periodic acquisitions of, or investments in entities that
operate within its chosen markets. During year ended December31, 2007, the Company acquired or
invested in several entities resulting in approximately $89million of acquired goodwill. A
portion of this amount related to the accrual for the earn-out of the 2005 acquisition of
TruVision, which has been included in the purchase price allocation. 56 2006 Goodwill Impairment During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $41
million associated with an ambulatory surgery center since the carrying amount of the reporting
unit was greater than the fair value of the reporting unit as determined using the expected present
value of future cash flows. This center was sold in 2007 and is presented as discontinued
operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 10. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Companys other intangible assets consist of practice management agreements PMAs,
deferred contract rights, trade names and other intangibles. The Company has no indefinite-lived
intangible assets. Amortization expense was $34million, $35million and $40million for the
years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The remaining weighted average amortization period for PMAs is 38years, for deferred
contract rights is 44years, for trade names is 173years and for other intangibles is 86years
as of December31, 2007. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist of the following at December31

New Credit Facility dated June2007 During June2007, the Company entered into a $1100million credit facility New Credit
Facility. The facility is secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and consists of
both senior term debt and a revolver as follows Senior term debt, totaling $850million, with a six-year term and required amortization
payments of 1% per annum plus a percentage of excess cash flow as defined in the agreement
and sales of assets or borrowings outside of the normal course of business. As of December
31, 2007, $827million was outstanding on this portion of the facility. A revolving credit facility, totaling $250million with a five-year term. As of
December31, 2007, no borrowings were outstanding under this portion of the facility and
approximately $238million was unused and available, which is net of outstanding letters of
credit totaling approximately $12million. The New Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain various financial and
non-financial covenants as defined in the agreement. Interest on the facility is calculated based on either prime rate or the London Interbank
Offered Rate LIBORplus a margin which at December31, 2007 was 150% for prime rate borrowings
and 250% for LIBOR rate borrowings. In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee equal to 035%
on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility. In connection with this facility, total
costs of $20million were incurred and recorded in other assets as deferred financing costs, and
will be amortized over the life of the facility. 58 Principal payments under the terms of the New Credit Facility over the next five years and
thereafter as of December31, 2007 are as follows

Under the New Credit Facility, the Company is required to make additional principal payments
annually on the term loan if excess cash flow exists. During the year ended December31, 2007, it
was determined the Company had excess cash flow under the terms of the New Credit Facility. As a
result, the Company will be required to make an estimated additional principal payment of $27
million during March2008. Such payment has been classified as current at December31, 2007. In February2008, the Company reached agreement with its lenders to amend the consolidated
fixed charge coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants associated with the New Credit Facility.
Refer to Note 27, Subsequent Event, for additional information regarding this amendment. As of
December31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the New Credit
Facility. Credit Facility dated November2003 In November2003, the Company obtained a $15million line of credit for five years from GE
Healthcare Financial Services the Credit Facility for a $01million commitment fee and $02
million in related legal and out-of-pocket expenses. This loan was secured by certain accounts
receivable and cash accounts in wholly-owned subsidiaries and a general lien on most other U.S.
assets. As of December31, 2006, the Company did not have any borrowings drawn under the line of
credit and had an available unused line of $15million. The Credit Facility dated November2003
was subsequently replaced by the New Credit Facility dated June2007, as described in further
detail above. Capital Lease Obligations The Company has entered into various capital leases, primarily to purchase equipment.
Payments for capital lease obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter as of

consideration received for the sale of the building and related land was Cdn$101million, which
was comprised of Cdn$86million in cash and a Cdn$15million 80% note receivable Note. The
Note has a seven-year term with the first of four annual payments of Cdn$01million starting on
the third anniversary of the sale and a final payment of Cdn$11million due on the seventh
anniversary of the sale. The Company accounted for this transaction in accordance with SFAS No98, Accounting for
Leases SFAS 98. SFAS 98 prohibits sale recognition on a sale-leaseback transaction when the
sublease is considered to be other than minor and the Companys only recourse to any future amounts
owing from the other party is other than the leased asset. A sublease is considered to be minor
when the present value of the sublease rent is less than 10% of the total fair market value. The
Company accounted for the transaction as a financing transaction which requires sale proceeds to be
recorded as a liability and for the Note to not be recognized. In addition, since the sale
recognition is not accounted for, the carrying value of the asset is not adjusted for and the asset
continues to be depreciated over the original depreciation period of 40years. Lease payments,
exclusive of an interest portion, decrease the liability 59 while payments received on the Note increase the liability. As of December31, 2007 and 2006,
the liability outstanding relating to the sale-leaseback transaction was $63million and $57
million, respectively. Future minimum lease payments over the next five years and thereafter are as follows

14. CAPITAL LEASE AGREEMENT In conjunction with a portion of TLCVisions refractive procedures, the Company utilizes
American Medical Optics IntraLase femtosecond laser technology to create bladeless corneal flaps.
Most lasers were obtained from the manufacturer and accounted for as a capital lease under SFAS No.
13, Accounting for Leases. Effective December18, 2007, the Company amended its Master Capital
Lease Agreement which extended the lease payment period and reduced periodic lease payments.
Management has determined that the amended lease agreement still qualifies as a capital lease.
Under SFAS No13, when both the original lease and the amended agreement are classified as capital
leases, the recorded asset and obligation balances are adjusted at the date of the revision, by the
difference between the outstanding obligation balance and the present value of the future minimum
lease payments. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an approximate $1million reduction to its
debt and fixed asset balances during the quarter ended December31, 2007. 15. SHARE REPURCHASE During June2007, the Company repurchased and cancelled 200million of its outstanding common
shares representing approximately 30% of total shares outstanding through a modified Dutch
auction. The shares were purchased at a price of $575 per share with a total cost of $1176
million including applicable transaction expenses. This transaction was financed through a
combination of cash-on-hand, short-term investments, and the $85million proceeds under the
Companys New Credit Facility described in Note 13, Long-term Debt. 16. INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As
required under the Companys New Credit Facility, during August and December2007 the Company
entered into interest rate swap agreements to eliminate the variability of the cash flows in
interest payments for a majority of the total variable rate debt. Under the agreement entered
August2007, the Company receives a floating rate based on the LIBOR interest rate plus 25% and
pays a fixed rate of 50% on notional amounts ranging from $20 to $42million over the life of the
swap agreement, which matures on April1, 2010. Under the agreement entered December2007, with an
effective date of January2, 2008, the Company receives a floating rate based on the LIBOR interest
rate plus 25%, and pays a fixed rate of 39% on notional amounts ranging from $20 to $32million
over the life of the swap agreement, which matures on April1, 2010. As of December31, 2007 the outstanding notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $20
million and the Company has recorded a liability of $08million to recognize the fair value of the
interest derivatives. The net offset is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, as the
instruments have been designated as qualifying cash flow hedges. 17. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION As of December31, 2007, the Company has issued stock options to employees, directors and
certain other individuals. Options granted have terms ranging from five to ten years. Vesting
provisions on options granted to date primarily include options that vest immediately and options
that vest in equal amounts annually, typically over a four year period. Total stock-based compensation for the years ended December31, 2007 was $11million no tax
impact. Total stock-based compensation for 2007 included expense for TLCVision stock options and
its Employee Share Purchase Plan. Total stock-based compensation for the year ended December31,
2006 was $14million $12million after tax. 60 As of December31, 2007, the issued and outstanding options denominated in Canadian dollars were at

The weighted average remaining contractual lives of U.S. and Canadian exercisable options as
of December31, 2007 were 22years and 13years, respectively. For the year ended December31,
2006, the weighted average remaining contractual lives of U.S. and Canadian exercisable options
were 21years and 11years, respectively. During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the total intrinsic value of options
exercised, defined as the excess fair value of the underlying stock over the exercise price of the
options, was approximately $21million and $08million, respectively. The Company granted 14million and 19million options during the years ended December31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. The options granted had a fair value of $23million for the year
ended 2007 and $52million for the year ended 2006 2005 $06million. The fair value of TLCVisions options granted was estimated at the date of grant for employee
options and at the measurement date for non-employee options using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk free interest rate of 357%, 448% and
399% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively; no dividends; volatility factors of the expected
market price of TLCVisions common shares of 056, 060 and 075 for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively; and a weighted average expected option life of 49, 41 and 25years for 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility on the Companys
common stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of
grant. The dividend yield on the Companys common stock is assumed to be zero since the Company has
not paid dividends and has no current plans to do so in the future due to restrictions contained
within the Companys New Credit Facility. The expected life was primarily based on historical
exercise patterns of option holders. As of December31, 2007, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to TLCVision
non-vested employee awards was approximately $39million. The unrecognized compensation expense
will be recognized over the remaining vesting period, which expires December2011 for certain
options. The weighted-average expense period for non-vested employee awards is 32years. 62 18. INCOME TAXES During 2006, the Company released $72million of its valuation allowance. The Companys
determination of the amount of valuation allowance to release was based primarily on expected
taxable income in future years. However, due to the uncertainty of future earnings, uncertainty in
the overall industry, and other factors, the valuation allowance release of $72million related
only to the net operating loss carry forwards that were forecasted to be utilized during 2007. Of
the $72million release, $53million increased the income tax benefit and $19million reduced
goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company determined that sufficient evidence no longer
existed to support recognition of a deferred tax asset. As a result, the Company increased the
valuation allowance by $72million. This determination was based on many factors including the
current year loss, a significant decrease to taxable income forecasted in future periods, and other
relevant factors. The $72million change to the valuation allowance increased income tax expense
during 2007. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows

As of December31, 2007, the Company has net operating losses available for carry forward for
income tax purposes of approximately $2486million, which may be available to reduce taxable
income in future years. The U.S. carry forward losses of $1870million expire between 2007 and
2027. The Canadian and United Kingdom carry forward losses can only be utilized by the source
company. The United Kingdom carry forward losses of $74million relate to United Kingdom
operations that the Company has ceased. As such, the Company does not expect to utilize these
losses. The Canadian carry forward losses of $541million expire between 2007 and 2017. Of the total valuation allowance, approximately $110million and $120million will be
recorded directly to equity and as a reduction to goodwill, respectively, if and when those
portions of the deferred tax assets are realized and the associated valuation allowance is
reversed. Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes significant annual
limitations on the utilization of net operating losses NOLs. Such NOL limitations result upon
the occurrence of certain events, including an ownership change as defined by Section382. Under Section382, when an ownership change occurs, the calculation of the annual NOL
limitation is affected by several factors, including the number of shares outstanding and the
trading price before the ownership change occurred. The Company experienced an ownership
change in June2007 in conjunction with the Companys share repurchase, as discussed in Note 15.
However, the resulting annual limit, did not impact the Companys anticipated utilization of
available NOLs. Based upon publicly filed documents, a shareholder acquired a significant amount of shares
during February2008. When combined with other recent shareholder transactions, it is reasonably
possible this transaction could trigger another ownership change. The Company intends to engage a
tax service provider to perform a comprehensive IRC Section382 study to determine if an ownership
change occurred and if so, the specific limitations related to certain of its net operating loss
carry forwards. That study is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2008.
Depending on the results of this comprehensive study, it is possible that the utilization of a
significant amount of the Companys net operating losses will be limited in future periods, thus
reaching expiration. 63 During the second quarter of 2006, the Company completed a comprehensive Section382 study.
The results of that study indicated that the availability of the Companys net operating loss carry
forwards each year were greater than its previous estimate. Based on the results of this study,
the Company recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment for its change in estimate to properly
reflect income taxes. The adjustment recorded in 2006 for the change in estimate included a $34
million increase to income tax benefit, of which $09million related to periods prior to 2006. In
addition, the adjustment for the change in estimate decreased goodwill, common stock, and income
taxes payable by $39million, $48million and $25million, respectively. During 2006, the Company completed an analysis to determine the availability of interest
deductions related to intercompany debt transactions with a Hungarian Offshore Company. The
results of this study indicated that the availability of the Companys interest deductions in
accordance with IRC Section 163j were greater than its previous estimate. Based on the results
of this study, the Company recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment for its change in estimate to
properly reflect income taxes. The adjustment recorded in 2006 for the change in estimate includes
a $15million increase to income tax benefit, of which $19million related to periods prior to
2006. In addition, the adjustment for the change in estimate increased goodwill by $15million. The differences between the provision for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the
statutory Canadian income tax rate to income before income taxes were as follows

The Company has established accruals for certain tax contingencies for exposures associated
with tax deductions and return filing positions which may be challenged. The tax contingency
accruals are adjusted quarterly in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress
of tax audits, case law and statute of limitations. A number of years may elapse before a
particular matter is resolved. The Company believes its tax contingency accruals are adequate to
address known tax contingencies. Tax contingency accruals are recorded in accrued liabilities in
the balance sheets. In July2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48 FIN 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. FIN 48 provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax
positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No109. The first step is to evaluate the tax
position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of 64 related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax
benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January1, 2007. As a result of implementing FIN 48, the Company recognized a $08million decrease to reserves
for uncertain tax positions. This decrease was accounted for as an adjustment to the beginning
balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet. Including the cumulative effect decrease, at
the beginning of 2007 the Company had approximately $03million of total gross unrecognized tax
benefits, all of which would favorably impact the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes
accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The
Company has accrued $01million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax
benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not reflect actual outcomes. 19. OTHER EXPENSES INCOME, NET Other expenses income, net include the following operating items

65 The calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2006 and 2005 excludes the impact of 25
million and 10million, respectively, of stock options and warrants because to include them would
have been anti-dilutive. For 2007, due to net losses incurred, the effects of including the
incremental shares associated with options and warrants are anti-dilutive and are not included in
the weighted-average shares outstanding-diluted. The total weighted-average number of options that
were in the money for the year ended December31, 2007 was 23million. 21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments The Company leases certain center facilities under operating leases with terms generally of
five to ten years. Certain leases contain rent escalation clauses and free rent periods that are
charged to rent expense on a straight-line basis. The leases usually contain renewal clauses at the
Companys option at fair market value. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 total
rent expense, including minimum and contingent payments, was $100million, $91million and $78
million, respectively. As of December31, 2007, the Company has commitments relating to
non-cancellable operating leases for rental of office space and equipment, which require future
minimum payments aggregating approximately $324million. Future minimum payments over the next
five years and thereafter are as follows

As of December31, 2007, the Company had commitments related to long-term marketing contracts
which require payments totaling $20million during the year ending December31, 2008. The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, MSS, is the U.S. distributor of the Foresee
PHPTM, a diagnostic piece of equipment utilized by optometrists and ophthalmologists for
the early detection of wet age-related macular degeneration. MSS will have annual inventory
purchase commitments related to the Foresee PHPTM totaling $73million during 2008 and
2009. Legal Contingencies On February21, 2007, Lindsay Atwood, as Shareholders Representative pursuant to the October
2005 Agreement and Plan of Merger by which the Company acquired TruVision, Inc., filed a lawsuit in
state court in Salt Lake City, Utah in a matter styled Atwood v. TLC Vision Corporation. The
lawsuit has been stayed and the complaint is in arbitration. Atwood challenges the calculation of
the first of three annual earn-out payments set forth in the merger agreement. The Company intends
to vigorously defend this action. During 2007, although no settlement has been reached, the
Company has made a provision for the potential outcome of this arbitration. Such provision did not
impact net income as earn-out payments are considered additional purchase consideration and
recorded as additional goodwill related to the acquisition. The Company is also subject to other various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course
of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. These matters include, without
limitation, professional liability, employee-related matters and inquiries and investigations by
governmental agencies. While the ultimate results of such matters cannot be predicted with
certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Regulatory Tax Contingencies TLCVision operates in 48 states and two Canadian provinces and is subject to various federal,
state and local income, payroll, unemployment, property, franchise, capital, sales and use tax on
its operations, payroll, assets and services. TLCVision endeavors to comply with all such
applicable tax regulations, many of which are subject to different interpretations, and has hired
outside tax advisors who assist in the process. Many states and other taxing authorities have been
interpreting laws and regulations more aggressively to the detriment of taxpayers such as TLCVision
and its customers. TLCVision believes that it has adequate provisions and accruals in its financial
statements for tax liabilities, although it cannot predict the outcome of future tax assessments. 66 22. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products
and services. They are managed and evaluated separately by the chief operating decision maker
because each business requires different management and marketing strategies. Prior to 2007, the
Company aggregated the refractive centers and access operations into one reportable segment.
Beginning in 2007, the Company realigned its organization such that the refractive access segment
is now being managed and reported separately. For comparison purposes, the segment information for
all prior periods has been restated, as necessary, to reflect this change in reportable segments.
The Company has three lines of business and six reportable segments including Other as follows   
Refractive Centers: The refractive centers business provides the majority of
the Companys revenue and is in the business of providing corrective laser surgery
principally LASIK in fixed sites typically branded under the TLC name.   
Doctor Services: The doctor services business provides a variety of services
and products directly to doctors and the facilities in which they perform surgery. It
consists of the following segments   
Mobile Cataracts: The mobile cataract segment provides technology and diagnostic
equipment and services to doctors and hospitals to support cataract surgery as well as
other eye diseases.   
Refractive Access: The refractive access segment assists surgeons in providing
corrective laser surgery in their own practice location by providing refractive
technology, technicians, service and practice development support at the surgeons
office.   
Other: The Company has an accumulation of businesses that manage surgical and
secondary care centers. None of these businesses meets the quantitative criteria to be
disclosed separately as a reportable segment and they are included in Other for
segment disclosure purposes.   
Eye Care: The eye care business consists of two business segments   
Optometric Franchising: The optometric franchising segment provides marketing,
practice development and purchasing power to independently-owned and operated
optometric practices in the United States.   
Age-Related Macular Degeneration AMD: The AMD segment includes the Companys
ownership interest in OccuLogix, which is pursuing commercial applications for
specific eye diseases including dry age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and
dry-eye syndrome.   
Corporate depreciation and amortization of $24million, $26million, and $20million for 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively, is included in corporate operating expenses. For purposes of the
depreciation and amortization disclosures shown below, these amounts are included in the
Refractive Centers segment.   
The Company reviews its definition of centers when there is a change in its level of operating
control and/or ownership at the center, or if the mode of service delivery at the location is
significantly altered. As a result, prior year figures may vary from previously reported
financials in order to better reflect changes in the Companys current portfolio of centers.   
Assets of the Companys corporate operations, including corporate headquarters, have not been
allocated among the various segments. The amounts are included in the Refractive Centers
segment.   
The Companys reportable segments are as follows 67

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and
accrued liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term maturities of these
instruments. The fair value of the Companys auction rate securities outstanding at December31, 2006
equals cost due to the short time period between the reset dates for the interest rates. As of
December31, 2007, the Company had no auction rate securities outstanding. As of December31, 2007, the carrying value and fair value of the Companys long-term debt,
excluding capital lease obligations, was $928million and $916million, respectively. As of
December31, 2006, the carrying value and fair value of the Companys long-term debt, excluding
capital lease obligations, was $95million and $88million, respectively. The fair value of the
Companys long-term debt was estimated by discounting the amount of future cash flows associated
with the respective debt instruments using the Companys current incremental rate of borrowing for
similar debt instruments. The carrying value of the Companys cost method investments was $36million as of December
31, 2007 and 2006. The fair value of the Companys cost method investments was not estimated as
there were no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse
effect on the fair value of the investments. In addition, it is not practicable for the Company to
estimate the 69 fair value of its cost method investments since quoted market prices are not available, and a
reasonable estimate of fair value could not be made without incurring excessive costs. 24. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Non-cash transactions

2007. The amendment raises the interest rate margin on all of the Companys debt under the New
Credit Facility by 250% per annum, effective February2008. The Company has accounted for the
amendment as a modification of debt. Estimated creditor and legal fees incurred of approximately
$06million will be capitalized, to the extent allowable, during the quarter ending March31,
2008, and amortized through 2013. 28. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED The following is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of operations

Item 4A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily
is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. As of the end of the period covered by the report, the Company carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the
Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were
effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
reports the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and
forms. There have been no significant changes in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December31, 2007 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the Companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal
Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December31, 2007,
the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, has
been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who also
audited the Companys consolidated financial statements. Ernst Youngs
attestation report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting is included in
Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 72 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TLC Vision Corporation We have audited TLC Vision Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. TLC Vision
Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, TLC Vision Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of TLC Vision Corporation as of December31,
2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and
cash flows for each ofthe three years in the period ended December31, 2007 and our report dated
March12, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
