Controller since January 1, 1993. From July 1991 to December 1992, she was
Manager of Financial Projects. She previously had practiced public accounting

Compliance With Section 16a of The Exchange Act of 1934
Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the
Company officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of
ServiceMaster shares, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership
with the Securities and Exchange Commission the Commission and the New York
Stock Exchange. The Commission regulations require certain officers, directors
and greater-than-ten-percent shareholders to furnish to the Company copies of
all Section 16a forms that they file. During 1997, the Company predecessor
received Section 16a forms from such officers and directors. As of January 1,
1998, the Company did not have any shareholders with an interest greater than
ten percent.
Based solely on a review of the copies of Section 16a forms received
by the Company and its predecessor or on written representations from certain
reporting persons that no Form 5 was required for those persons, the Company
believes that during 1997 the officers and directors of the Company and its
predecessor complied with applicable filing requirements, except that one report
covering one February 1997 transaction for 943 shares was filed late by Mr.
Mrozek and one report covering one December 1997 transaction for 3,194,609
shares was filed late by Mr. Peterson.
