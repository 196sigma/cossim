equal the total computed for the fiscal year or any cumulative interim period. 2

Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful, and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Also, operating results may fall below our expectations and
the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future quarters. If this were to occur, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. For more information regarding the quarterly fluctuation of our revenues and
operating results, see the section captioned BusinessFactors That May Affect Future Results of OperationsOur operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain.

31 PART II  Item 5.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of December 31, 2003, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in this annual report on Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms for Form 10-K.  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within VeriSign have been detected.
