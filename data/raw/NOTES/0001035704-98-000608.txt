NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Kentek Information Systems, Inc. the Company is a supplier of
mid-range, non-impact laser printers and related consumable supplies and spare
parts. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in
1981. The Company operations in the United States U.S. consist of
manufacturing facilities in Boulder, Colorado, which are used to manufacture the
consumable supply products. The Company principal subsidiary, Nippon Kentek
Kaisha Ltd., a Delaware corporation Nippon Kentek, is engaged in research
and development and manufacturing-related activities in Japan. The Company
designs and engineers its printer engines and supervises their assembly under
contract with a Japanese company. The Company distributes its printers,
consumable supplies and spare parts exclusively through sales to OEM customers
and systems integrators.
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Kentek
Europe BV, Kentek GmbH and Nippon Kentek. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency Translation - The functional currency for the
Company foreign operations is the applicable local currency. The translation
of the applicable foreign currency into U.S. dollars is performed for balance
sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date
and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate
during the period. Resulting translation adjustments are accumulated in the
foreign currency translation adjustment component of stockholders' equity.
Currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in net income currently.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
In addition, significant estimates are included in the accompanying
financial statements related to reserves for inventory obsolescence,
uncollectible accounts receivable and warranty reserves which are based upon
historical and developing trends, aging of items, and other information deemed
pertinent to estimate collectibility and realizability. It is possible that
these reserves may change within a year, and the effect of the change could be
material to the consolidated financial statements.
Cash Equivalents - The Company considers cash, money market accounts
and all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities - Management has determined that the Company
marketable securities portfolio consists of both available-for-sale and trading
securities.
Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale are available to
support current operations and to take advantage of other investment
opportunities. These securities are stated at fair value based upon market
quotations. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were
not significant. Realized gains and losses are included in other income, net.
Marketable securities classified as trading securities are carried at
fair value based upon market quotations. Net realized and unrealized gains and
losses on trading securities are included in other income, net.
Concentrations of Credit Risk - The Company financial instruments
that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and
cash equivalent balances in excess of the insurance provided by federal
insurance authorities, marketable securities and accounts receivable.
The Company cash equivalents are placed with a major financial
institution and are primarily invested in investment grade commercial paper with
an average original maturity of three months or less and money market accounts.
The Company marketable securities consist of commercial paper and various
equity securities. The exposure to loss resulting from the concentrations of
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to generally
short payment terms and the customers' dispersion across geographic areas. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customer financial condition
and generally requires no collateral from its customers.
Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined
primarily by the weighted moving average method or market.
Property, Equipment and Depreciation - Property and equipment are
stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives                                                            YEARS
Tooling                                                     3
Furniture, fixtures and equipment                                       3-7
Leasehold improvements                                        Term of Lease     Impairment of Long-lived Assets - The carrying value of long-lived
assets and certain identified intangible assets held and used by the Company are
evaluated for impairment whenever there is an event or change in circumstances
that indicates that such assets have been impaired or that the carrying value of
such assets might not be recoverable.
20  21
Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which
requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting
for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed
annually for differences between the financial statement basis and the income
tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible
amounts in the future. Such deferred income tax computations are based on
enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the years in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income.
Stock Option Plans - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees and has adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.
Net Income Per Share - During 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share. SFAS No. 128 establishes standards for computing and
presenting earnings per share EPS and supercedes APB Opinion No. 15 and its
related interpretations. All prior periods presented have been restated in
accordance with SFAS No. 128. SFAS No. 128 replaces the presentation of primary
EPS with a presentation of basic EPS, which excludes dilution, and requires dual
presentation of basic and diluted EPS for all entities with complex capital
structures. Diluted EPS is computed similarly to fully diluted EPS pursuant to
APB Opinion No. 15. For the year ended June 30, 1996, net income has been
reduced by the Excess Liquidation Preference ELP Note 5 attributable to
the Senior Convertible Preferred Stock SCPS totaling $1,352,000, in
computing net income per share. Stock options were omitted from the denominator
because they were antidilutive and were not material. A reconciliation of the
numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings
per share is presented below.                           Income      Shares       Per-Share

Revenue Recognition and Product Warranty - Sales of printers,
consumable supplies and spare parts are recorded upon shipment to customers. The
Company warrants its printers against defects in design, materials and
workmanship for two years. A provision for estimated future costs relating to
warranty expense is recorded when products are shipped.
Research and development - Costs incurred in connection with research
and development activities are expensed as incurred.
New Accounting Pronouncements- In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No.
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS N. 130 establishes standards for
reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues,
expenses, gains, and losses in a full set of general-purpose financial
statements. The Company is required to adopt this statement in fiscal year 1999.
Reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for
comparative purposes are required. The Company has determined that the adoption
of this Statement will have no material impact on its financial disclosures.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information, which will be effective for the
Company beginning July 1, 1998. SFAS No. 131 redefines how operating segments
are determined and requires disclosure of certain financial and descriptive
information about a company operating segments. The Company has determined
that the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on its
financial statement disclosures.                    21
22
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring that all derivative instruments including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133
requires that changes in the derivative fair value be recognized currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The accounting
provisions for qualifying hedges allow gains and losses recognized related to a
hedged item in the income statement to be offset by related derivative gains
and losses, and requires the Company to formally document, designate, and assess
the effectiveness of transactions that qualify for hedge accounting. The Company
is not required to adopt this Statement until July 1999. The Company has not
determined its method or timing of adopting this Statement or the impact on its
financial statements. However, when adopted this Statement could increase
volatility in reported earnings and other comprehensive income of the Company.
In January 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. This SOP
provides guidance on the accounting for computer software costs. In April 1998,
the AICPA issued SOP No. 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities.
This SOP provides guidance on the accounting for the cost of start-up
activities. The Company is not required to adopt these statements until July
2000 and does not expect the adoption of these standards to result in material
changes to previously reported amounts or disclosures.
Reclassifications - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform with the current year presentation.
2.    INVESTMENTS
Marketable Securities - The Company accounts for its investments in
marketable securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. SFAS No. 115 requires an entity to
categorize its investments as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading
securities, according to the use of investment, and to record unrealized gains
and losses in net income or as separate component of stockholders' equity,
depending on the investment classification. Management determines the proper
classifications of investments in obligations with fixed maturities and
marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
designations as of each balance sheet date. As of June 30, 1998 and 1997,
available-for-sale and trading securities consisted of the following                                 GROSS       GROSS      ESTIMATED

contractual maturity dates ranging from July 1998 to April 2029, the cost for
these securities approximated their fair value as of June 30, 1998 and 1997.
During 1998 and 1997, proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities
approximated $13,233,000 and $6,367,000, respectively. The Company uses the
specific identification method to determine cost for available-for-sale
securities. Gross unrealized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale
securities were not material in 1998 and 1997. Net unrealized holding gains on
trading securities of $433,000 and $159,000 have been included in net income for
1998 and 1997, respectively.
Investments in Limited Partnerships - As of June 30, 1998, the Company
has investments in two limited partnerships. The first investment of $3,000,000
was made in June 1998 in the HCM High Yield Opportunity Fund, LP HCM. The
prospectus for HCM indicates that HCM investment objective is to provide
investors with risk-adjusted rates of return through a portfolio structured to
generally have the following characteristics: low volatility; short duration
generally less than 2 years; and an overall high degree of liquidity in the
underlying securities. The partnership will attempt to achieve these objectives
through a two-pronged investment strategy: an emphasis on non-investment grade
fixed income financial instruments including bonds and bank loans that, in
HCM judgement, are likely i to be repurchased by the issuer at a premium
within twelve to eighteen months as a result of the occurrence of a corporate
event such as an IPO, asset sale, merger or refinancing and ii active trading
of the portfolio. Withdrawals from the partnership may be made quarterly with 30
days notice. The second investment of $4,000,000 was also made in June 1998 in
Cerberus, LP CLP. The prospectus for CLP indicates that CLP invests in
publicly traded and private debt, trade claims, large and middle market bank
loans, distressed real estate and public and private equity, including post
bankruptcy equity. To control risk, assets are broadly diversified among 60 or
more positions. Withdrawals from the fund may be made each June 30 and December
31 with 90 days notice. The Company accounts for the investments in limited
partnerships at cost. Based on information provided by HCM and CLP General
Partners, the Company proportionate share in the fair value of each
partnership as of June 30, 1998 approximated the Company carrying value for
each investment.

The Company has an unsecured revolving line-of-credit agreement with a
bank, which expires October 31, 1998. The available loan amount is $5,000,000.
The line-of-credit agreement provides for interest at the bank prime rate. The
Company must meet certain financial ratio requirements under the terms of the
agreement. At June 30, 1998 and 1997, no amounts were drawn on the
line-of-credit.
5. CAPITAL STOCK
The Company Board of Directors have authorized a stock buy-back
program with a maximum repurchase of 5% of the outstanding common shares.
Management intends to evaluate its investments and the Company current stock
price in determining the timing and amount of stock repurchase. During 1998,
1997 and 1996, the Company declared and paid cash dividends per common share
equal to $008, $008 and nil, respectively.
On April 17, 1996, the Company completed its IPO of 2,200,000 shares of
common stock in the offering at $8 per share. In addition, non-management
stockholders sold an additional 675,000 shares. The Company received $15,623,000
in proceeds, net of offering costs of $1,977,000.
Effective immediately prior to the IPO, the outstanding SCPS and
Convertible Preferred Stock CPS were converted into common stock and the
SCPS and CPS authorized shares were canceled. The SCPS was voting and had a
primary liquidation preference of $1 per share, plus the aggregate amount of the
ELP. ELP accrued on the SCPS at an annual rate of 12%. On April 23, 1996, the
ELP of approximately $4,152,000 was paid to SCPS holders, and the SCPS shares
were converted into common stock at a conversion rate of 13869245 shares of
common stock per SCPS share. Note 1.

Options issued to officers and employees under the Plan vest
proportionately over three years on each of the first, second, and third
anniversary dates of the option grant date and expire in five years. Options
granted subsequent to July 1, 1997 have a ten-year life. Options issued to
directors under the Plan vest 100% six months after the grant date and expire in
ten years.
The Company accounts for stock options issued to officers, directors and
employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed
by APB No. 25 and has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for options issued
under the Plan. Had compensation expense for the Plan been determined based on
the fair value at the grant date of awards under those plans consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net earnings and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                    23

used for grants in 1998, 1997 and 1996; risk-free interest rate of 520% in
1998, 600% in 1997 and 647% in 1996; annual dividend of $08; expected life of
five years; and expected volatility of 5321% in 1998, 5700% in 1997 and 5150%
in 1996. The outstanding stock options at June 30, 1998 have a weighted average
remaining contractual life of four years. The weighted average fair value of

The net deferred tax asset of $2,773,000 at June 30, 1998 is realizable
as the Company has determined, based on several recurring periods of profitable
operations, continuing efforts to enhance and develop existing and new customer
relationships, its movement of a substantial portion of its supplies
manufacturing to the United States from Japan and the strengthening of the
dollar against the yen, that it is more likely than not that it will have
sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the corresponding tax
benefit resulting from the deferred tax asset. Management plans to re-evaluate
the positive and negative evidence to this effect on a quarterly basis and make
appropriate adjustments to the deferred tax asset. Components of the net
deferred tax asset, other than property and equipment, primarily reverse
annually. As a result of the nature of these temporary differences, $773,000 of
the net deferred tax asset at June 30, 1998 is classified as non-current. The
non-current portion, which is included in deposits and other assets, is
attributable to property and equipment.
The net deferred tax asset at June 30, 1997 was $3,338,000. The current
portion of $2,628,000 is a result of temporary differences that primarily
reverse annually. The remaining non-current portion of $710,000 is attributable
to property and equipment.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company has operations in Japan, and as a result, operating
expenses are dependent on dollar-yen exchange rates. The Company has purchased
Japanese yen forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign
currencies on its reported income, generally over the ensuing three months. The
forward contracts do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes and
are reported in the financial statements net of changes in forward rates that
are reflected in income. Although the volatility of income over the period
covered by such contracts is reduced, increased volatility may be reported
during interim periods. The counterparties to the Company forward contracts
consist of two financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of
risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis and
present no significant credit risk to the Company. As of June 30, 1997, the
Company did not have any foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. At June
30, 1998, outstanding Japanese yen contractual amounts were as follows                       NOTIONAL
