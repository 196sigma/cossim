Item 5.Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2009, being the date of the most recently completed fiscal year. This evaluation was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of George W. Trahan, Chief Executive Officer and Jan L. Hauhe, Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that current disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
by the rulesand forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rulesand forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The term internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the registrants principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the registrants board of directors, management and other personnel,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that

During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009.Improvements to strengthen internal controls have been made
during the current fiscal year and will continue to be made to address the identified weakness. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2009, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework.Because of the material weakness described in the following paragraph, management is required to conclude that, as of May 31, 2009, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria.Management believes however that internal controls over financial reporting is adequate to ensure that the Companys financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-K present fairly
in all material respects the Companys financial position, results of operation, and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2009, an internal control weakness relating to monitoring and risk assessment was identified.To be removed from the material weakness category, further improvements in monitoring and risk assessment related to control activities performed
by management will be required. As part of the communications by Raimondo Pettit Group, with respect to their audit procedures for fiscal year 2009, Raimondo Pettit Group informedthe CFO and CEO of this material weakness as defined by Auditing Standard No5, An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Performed in Conjunction with an Audit

In accordance with Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company intends to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate this material weakness. We intend to consider the results of our remediation efforts and related testing as part of our fiscal year-end 2010 assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to
