The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Rent-A-Center, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Rent-A-Center, Inc. as of December31, 2014and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and our report dated March 2, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements./s/KPMG LLPDallas, TexasMarch 2, 201540MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLOVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGManagement of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Companys Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. A system of internal control may become inadequate over time because of changes in conditions, or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013.Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December31, 2014, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles based on such criteria.KPMG LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K41RENT-A-CENTER, INC.

The difference of $25 million was repaid in cash and is included in repayments of debt in the statement above.See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements46RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNoteA Nature of Operations and Summary of Accounting PoliciesA summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows:Principles of Consolidation and Nature of OperationsThese financial statements include the accounts of Rent-A-Center, Inc., and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to Rent-A-Center refer only to Rent-A-Center, Inc., the parent, and references to we, us and our refer to the consolidated business operations of Rent-A-Center and any or all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. We report four operating segments: Core U.S., Acceptance Now, Mexico formerly reported as International, see Note S to the consolidated financial statements and Franchising.Our Core U.S. segment consists of company-owned rent-to-own stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico that lease household durable goods to customers on a rent-to-own basis. Our stores in Canada operate under the name Rent-A-Centre. We also offer merchandise on an installment sales basis in certain of our stores under the names Get It Now and Home Choice. At December31, 2014, we operated 2,824company-owned stores nationwide and in Canada and Puerto Rico, including 45retail installment sales stores.Our Acceptance Now segment generally offers the rent-to-own transaction to consumers who do not qualify for financing from the traditional retailer through kiosks located within such retailer locations. At December31, 2014, we operated 1,406Acceptance Now locations.Our Mexico segment consists of our company-owned rent-to-own stores in Mexico that lease household durable goods to customers on a rent-to-own basis. At December31, 2014, we operated 177stores in Mexico.Rent-A-Center Franchising International, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Rent-A-Center, is a franchisor of rent-to-own stores. At December31, 2014, Franchising had 187franchised stores operating in 30states. Our Franchising segment primary source of revenue is the sale of rental merchandise to its franchisees, who in turn offer the merchandise to the general public for rent or purchase under a rent-to-own transaction. The balance of our Franchising segment revenue is generated primarily from royalties based on franchisees' monthly gross revenues.Rental MerchandiseRental merchandise is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for merchandise is generally provided using the income forecasting method, which is intended to match as closely as practicable the recognition of depreciation expense with the consumption of the rental merchandise, and assumes no salvage value. The consumption of rental merchandise occurs during periods of rental and directly coincides with the receipt of rental revenue over the rental purchase agreement period. Under the income forecasting method, merchandise held for rent is not depreciated and merchandise on rent is depreciated in the proportion of rents received to total rents provided in the rental contract, which is an activity-based method similar to the units of production method. Effective January 1, 2013, we depreciate merchandise including computers, tablets and smartphones that is held for rent for at least 180consecutive days using the straight-line method over a period generally not to exceed 18 months. Prior to January 1, 2013, merchandise held for rent except for computers and tablets that was at least 270 daysold and held for rent for at least 180consecutive days, was depreciated using the straight-line method over a period generally not to exceed 20 months. Prior to January 1, 2013, the straight-line method was used for computers and tablets that were 24 monthsold or older and which had become idle over a period of at least six months, generally not to exceed an aggregate depreciation period of 30 months. This change has not had a significant impact on cost of revenues, gross profit, net earnings or earnings per share.Rental merchandise which is damaged and inoperable is expensed when such impairment occurs. If a customer does not return the merchandise or make payment, the remaining book value of the rental merchandise associated with delinquent accounts is generally charged off on the 90thday following the time the account became past due in the Core U.S. and Mexico segments, and on the 150thday in the Acceptance Now segment. We maintain a reserve for these expected expenses. In addition, any minor repairs made to rental merchandise are expensed at the time of the repair.Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. We maintain cash and cash equivalents at several financial institutions, which at times may not be federally insured or may exceed federally insured limits.We have not experienced any losses in such accounts and believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risks on such accounts47RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  is rented to customers pursuant to rental purchase agreements which provide for weekly, semi-monthly or monthly rental terms with non-refundable rental payments. Generally, the customer has the right to acquire title either through a purchase option or through payment of all required rentals. Rental revenue and fees are recognized over the rental term and merchandise sales revenue is recognized when the customer exercises the purchase option and pays the cash price due. Cash received prior to the period in which it should be recognized is deferred and recognized according to the rental term. Revenue is accrued for uncollected amounts due based on historical collection experience. However, the total amount of the rental purchase agreement is not accrued because the customer can terminate the rental agreement at any time and we cannot enforce collection for non-payment of future rents.Revenues from the sale of merchandise in our retail installment stores are recognized when the installment note is signed, the customer has taken possession of the merchandise and collectability is reasonably assured.Revenues from the sale of rental merchandise are recognized upon shipment of the merchandise to the franchisee. Franchise royalty income and fee revenue is recognized upon completion of substantially all services and satisfaction of all material conditions required under the terms of the franchise agreement. Some franchisees purchase directly from a supplier but request reimbursement through ColorTyme Finance, Inc. and we recognize revenue for the commission we earn on these transactions.Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe installment notes receivable associated with the sale of merchandise at our Get It Now and Home Choice stores generally consists of the sales price of the merchandise purchased and any additional fees for services the customer has chosen, less the customers down payment. No interest is accrued and interest income is recognized each time a customer makes a payment, generally on a monthly basis.We have established an allowance for doubtful accounts for our installment notes receivable. Our policy for determining the allowance is based on historical loss experience, as well as the results of managements review and analysis of the payment and collection of the installment notes receivable within the previous year. We believe our allowance is adequate to absorb any known or probable losses. Our policy is to charge off installment notes receivable that are 120 daysor more past due. Charge-offs are applied as a reduction to the allowance for doubtful accounts and any recoveries of previously charged off balances are applied as an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts. The majority of Franchisings trade and notes receivable relate to amounts due from franchisees. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of a franchisees financial condition and collateral is generally not required. Trade receivables are due within 30 daysand are stated at amounts due from franchisees net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. Franchising determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, Franchisings previous loss history, the franchisees current ability to pay its obligation to Franchising, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. Franchising writes off trade receivables that are 120 daysor more past due and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts.Property Assets and Related DepreciationFurniture, equipment and vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets generally five years by the straight-line method. Our building is depreciated over 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the useful life of the asset or the initial term of the applicable leases by the straight-line method, whichever is shorter.We have incurred costs to develop computer software for internal use. We capitalize the costs incurred during the application development stage, which includes designing the software configuration and interfaces, coding, installation, and testing. Costs incurred during the preliminary stages along with post-implementation stages of internally developed software are expensed as incurred. Internally developed software costs, once placed in service, are amortized over various periods up to ten years.We incur repair and maintenance expenses on our vehicles and equipment. These amounts are recognized when incurred, unless such repairs significantly extend the life of the asset, in which case we amortize the cost of the repairs for the remaining life of the asset utilizing the straight-line method48RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedGoodwill and Other Intangible AssetsWe record goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be periodically evaluated for impairment. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable from future cash flows. We perform an assessment of goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our reporting units are generally our reportable operating segments. Factors which could necessitate an interim impairment assessment include a sustained decline in our stock price, prolonged negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results. During the three months ended September 30, 2014, the Company changed its annual impairment testing date from December 31 to October 1. The Company believes this new date is preferable because it allows for more timely completion of the annual goodwill impairment test prior to the end of our annual financial reporting period. This change in accounting principle does not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. The Company has determined that it will be impracticable to objectively determine projected cash flow and related valuation estimates that would have been used as of each October 1 of prior reporting periods without the use of hindsight. As such, the Company applied the change in annual impairment testing date prospectively beginning October 1, 2014.We assess recoverability using methodologies which include the present value of estimated future cash flows and comparisons of multiples of enterprise values to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The analysis is based upon available information regarding expected future cash flows and discount rates. Discount rates are based upon our cost of capital. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, a second analysis is performed to measure the fair value of all assets and liabilities within the reporting unit. If, based on the second analysis, it is determined that the fair value of the assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value, we would recognize impairment charges in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over fair value. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $11 millionand $10 million, respectively, in our Core U.S. segment as a result of the sustained underperformance of certain stores located in Canada. These charges are included in amortization and write-down of intangibles in the consolidated statements of earnings.Acquired customer relationships are amortized utilizing the straight-line method over a 21month period, non-compete agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over the contractual life of the agreements, vendor relationships are amortized using the straight-line method over a 7or 15year period, other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the asset and goodwill associated with acquisitions is not amortized.Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsWe evaluate all long-lived assets, including intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amounts of such assets cannot be recovered by the undiscounted net cash flows they will generate.Self-Insurance LiabilitiesWe have self-insured retentions with respect to losses under our workers' compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and health insurance programs. We establish reserves for our liabilities associated with these losses by obtaining forecasts for the ultimate expected losses and estimating amounts needed to pay losses within our self-insured retentions. We make assumptions on our liabilities within our self-insured retentions using actuarial loss forecasts, company-specific development factors, general industry loss development factors, and third-party claim administrator loss estimates which are based on known facts surrounding individual claims. These assumptions incorporate expected increases in health care costs. Periodically, we reevaluate our estimate of liability within our self-insured retentions. At that time, we evaluate the adequacy of our reserves by comparing amounts reserved on our balance sheet for anticipated losses to our updated actuarial loss forecasts and third-party claim administrator loss estimates, and make adjustments to our reserves as needed.Foreign Currency TranslationThe functional currency of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are generally translated at a daily exchange rate and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction49RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedOther Comprehensive IncomeOther comprehensive income is comprised exclusively of our foreign currency translation adjustment.Income TaxesWe record deferred taxes for temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes become payable. Income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting in a different period in our tax returns. In particular, judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions, tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards NOLs, as represented by deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight and assist us in determining recoverability. When it is determined the recovery of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. We include NOLs in the calculation of deferred tax assets. NOLs are utilized to the extent allowable due to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and relevant state statutes.We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have recorded a liability, is audited and effectively settled. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. We classify interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense. We intend to reinvest substantially all of the unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and postpone their remittance indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes for these non-U.S. subsidiaries was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.Sales TaxesWe apply the net basis for sales taxes imposed on our goods and services in our consolidated statements of earnings. We are required by the applicable governmental authorities to collect and remit sales taxes. Accordingly, such amounts are charged to the customer, collected and remitted directly to the appropriate jurisdictional entity.Earnings Per Common ShareBasic earnings per common share are based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period presented. Diluted earnings per common share are based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus, if dilutive, the assumed exercise of stock options at the beginning of the year, or for the period outstanding during the year for current year issuances.Advertising CostsCosts incurred for producing and communicating advertising are expensed when incurred. Advertising expense was $948 million, $926 millionand $973 million, for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively.Stock-Based CompensationWe maintain long-term incentive plans for the benefit of certain employees and directors, which are described more fully in NoteN. We recognize share-based payment awards to our employees and directors at the estimated fair value on the grant date. Determining the fair value of any share-based award requires information about several variables that include, but are not limited to, expected stock volatility over the terms of the award, expected dividend yields and the predicted employee exercise behavior. We base expected life on historical exercise and post-vesting employment-termination experience, and expected volatility on historical realized volatility trends. In addition, all stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of an estimated forfeiture rate. The forfeiture rate is based upon historical activity and is analyzed at least annually as actual forfeitures occur. Compensation costs are recognized net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. We issue new shares to settle stock awards. Stock options are valued using a Black-Scholes pricing model. Restricted stock units are valued using the last 50RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedtrade before the day of the grant, adjusted for any provisions affecting fair value, such as the lack of dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period.Stock-based compensation expense is reported within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of  reclassifications have been made to the reported amounts for the prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on net earnings or earnings per share in any period.Use of EstimatesIn preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In applying accounting principles, we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.New Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606, which clarifies existing accounting literature relating to how and when a company recognizes revenue. Under ASU 2014-09, a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for Rent-A-Center beginning January 1, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted. The ASU allows adoption with either retrospective application to each prior period presented, or retrospective application with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. We are currently in the process of determining what impact, if any, the adoption of this ASU will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and we are evaluating the transition alternatives.From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that we adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe the impact of any other recently issued standards that are not yet effective are either not applicable to us at this time or will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.NoteB Correction of Immaterial ErrorsDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, we identified errors in accounting for revenues, cost of revenues and other store expenses resulting in an immaterial correction of errors in our previously issued consolidated financial statements. Each of these errors affected periods beginning prior to 2012 through December 31, 2014. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SABNo99, Materiality, and SAB No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, management evaluated the materiality of the errors from qualitative and quantitative perspectives, and concluded that while the errors did not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material misstatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, correcting these errors in the fourth quarter would have been material to the fourth quarter ended December 31, 201451RENT-A-CENTER, INC.

There are approximately $3481 millionof state NOL carryforwards expiring between 2015and 2032. Of the total remaining state NOL carryforwards, approximately 180% represent acquired NOLs. Utilization of these NOLs is subject to applicable annual limitations for U.S. state tax purposes.At December 31, 2014, the foreign NOL carryforwards were approximately $606 million, which expire between 2020and 2024, and are offset with a full valuation allowance. In addition, at December 31, 2014, we also had approximately $123 millionin foreign tax credit FTC carryforwards expiring between 2020and 2024. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent we consider it more likely than not that the deferred tax assets attributable to our NOLs, FTCs or other deferred tax assets will not be recovered.We have not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries because of our intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable; however, unrecognized foreign income tax credits would be available to reduce a portion of this liability.We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. Along with our U.S. subsidiaries, we file a U.S. federal consolidated income tax return. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, foreign and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011. We are currently under examination in various states. We do not anticipate that adjustments as a result of these audits, if any, will result in a material change to our consolidated statement of earnings, financial condition, statement of cash flows or earnings per share.

The Credit Agreement represents a refinancing of our senior secured debt outstanding under our prior credit agreement, the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 28, 2003, as amended and restated as of July 14, 2011, and as amended by the First Amendment dated as of April 13, 2012, among the Company, the several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent as amended, the Prior Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a new $9000 million senior credit facility consisting of $225 million in term loans the Term Loans and a $675 million revolving credit facility the Revolving Facility.Also, on March 19, 2014, we borrowed $2250 millionin Term Loans and $1000 millionunder the Revolving Facility and utilized the proceeds to repay our prior senior secured debt outstanding under the Prior Credit Agreement. The Term Loans are payable in consecutive quarterlyinstallments each in an aggregate principal amount of $562,500, with a final installment equal to the remaining principal balance of the Term Loans due on March19, 202160RENT-A-CENTER, INC.

At December31, 2014and 2013, the amounts available under the revolving credit facility were reduced by approximately $1044 millionand $1047 million, respectively, for our outstanding letters of credit.Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at varying ratesequal to either the Eurodollarrate plus 150%to 275%, or the primerate plus 050%to 175%ABR, at our election. The margins on the Eurodollar loans and on the ABR loans for borrowings under the Revolving Facility, which were 250%and 150%, respectively, at December 31, 2014, may fluctuate based upon an increase or decrease in our consolidated total leverage ratio as defined by a pricing grid included in the Credit Agreement. The margins on the Eurodollar loans and on the ABR loans for Term Loans are 300%and 200%, respectively, but may also fluctuate in the event the all-in pricing for any subsequent incremental Term Loan exceeds the all-in pricing for prior Term Loans by more than 050% per annum. A commitment fee equal to 030%to 050%of the unused portion of the Revolving Facility is payable quarterly, and fluctuates dependent upon an increase or decrease in our consolidated total leverage ratio. The commitment fee at December 31, 2014, is equal to 050%of the unused portion of the Revolving Facility.Our borrowings under the Credit Agreement are, subject to certain exceptions, secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property, and are also secured by a pledge of the capital stock of our U.S.subsidiaries.The Credit Agreement also permits us to increase the amount of the Term Loans and/or the Revolving Facility from time to time on up to three occasions, in an aggregate amount of no more than $2500 million, provided that we are not in default at the time and have obtained the consent of the administrative agent and the lenders providing such increase.Subject to a number of exceptions, the Credit Agreement contains, without limitation, covenants that generally limits our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:incur additional debt;repurchase capital stock, 6625% notes and 475% notes and/or pay cash dividends subject to a restricted payments basket under which approximately $83 millionis available;incur liens or other encumbrances;merge, consolidate or sell substantially all property or business;sell, lease or otherwise transfer assets other than in the ordinary course of business;make investments or acquisitions unless they meet financial tests and other requirements; orenter into an unrelated line of business.The Credit Agreement requires us to comply with several financial covenants, including: i a consolidated total leverage ratio of no greater than 450:1 from the quarter ended March 31, 2014, to the quarter ended September 30, 2015, 425:1 from the quarter ended December 31, 2015, to the quarter ended September 30, 2016, and 400:1 thereafter; ii a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio of no greater than 275:1; and iii a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 150:1 from the quarter ended March 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, and 175:1 thereafter.

In accordance with the Credit Agreement, the consolidated total leverage ratio was calculated by dividing the consolidated funded debt outstanding at December 31, 2014 $1,0217 million by consolidated EBITDA for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2014 $2871 million. For purposes of the covenant calculations, iconsolidated funded debt is defined as outstanding indebtedness less cash in excess of $250 million, and iiconsolidated EBITDA is generally defined as consolidated net income aplus the sum of income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, extraordinary non-cash expenses or losses, and other non-cash charges, and bminus the sum of interest income, extraordinary income or gains, other non-cash income, and cash payments with respect to extraordinary non-cash expenses or losses recorded in prior fiscal quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is presented not as a measure of operating results, but rather as a measure used to determine covenant compliance under our senior credit facilities.The consolidated senior secured leverage ratio was calculated pursuant to the Credit Agreement by dividing the consolidated senior secured debt outstanding at December 31, 2014 $4572 million by consolidated EBITDA for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2014 $2871 million. For purposes of the covenant calculation, consolidated senior secured debt is generally defined as the aggregate principal amount of consolidated funded debt that is then secured by liens on property or assets of the Company or its subsidiaries.The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was calculated pursuant to the Credit Agreement by dividing the sum of consolidated EBITDA and consolidated lease expense for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2014 $5314 million, by consolidated fixed charges for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2014 $2912 million. For purposes of the covenant calculation, consolidated fixed charges is defined as the sum of consolidated interest expense and consolidated lease expense.Events of default under our senior credit facilities include customary events, such as a cross-acceleration provision in the event that we default on other debt. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement would occur if a change of control occurs. This is defined to include the case where a third party becomes the beneficial owner of 35%or more of our voting stock or certain changes in Rent-A-Centers Board of Directors occur. An event of default would also occur if one or more judgments were entered against us of $500 millionor more and such judgments were not satisfied or bonded pending appeal within 30days after entry.We utilize our revolving credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit, as well as to manage normal fluctuations in operational cash flow caused by the timing of cash receipts. In that regard, we may from time to time draw funds under the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes. Amounts are drawn as needed due to the timing of cash flows and are generally paid down as cash is generated by our operating activities.In addition to the senior debt discussed above, we maintain a $200 million unsecured, revolving line of credit with INTRUST Bank, N.A. to facilitate cash management.The table below shows the scheduled maturity dates of our outstanding debt at December31, 2014.Term LoanRevolving FacilityINTRUST Line of CreditTotalYear Ending  INC.

A portion of the proceeds of this offering were used to repay approximately $2000 million of outstanding term debt under our senior credit facility. The remaining net proceeds were used to repurchase shares of our common stock.On May2, 2013, we issued $2500 millionin senior unsecured notes due May 2021, bearing interest at 4750%, pursuant to an indenture dated May 2, 2013, among Rent-A-Center, Inc., its subsidiary guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, as trustee. A portion of the proceeds of this offering were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under a $2000 million accelerated stock buyback program. The remaining net proceeds were used to repay outstanding revolving debt under our senior credit facility.The indenture governing the 6625% notes and the 475% notes are substantially similar. Each indenture contains covenants that limit our ability to:incur additional debt;sell assets or our subsidiaries;grant liens to third parties;pay cash dividends or repurchase stock subject to a restricted payments basket under which approximately $83 millionis available;andengage in a merger or sell substantially all of our assets.Events of default under each indenture include customary events, such as a cross-acceleration provision in the event that we default in the payment of other debt due at maturity or upon acceleration for default in an amount exceeding $500million, as well as in the event a judgment is entered against us in excess of $500million that is not discharged, bonded or insured.The 6625%notes may be redeemed on or after November15, 2015, at our option, in whole or in part, at a premium declining from 103313%. The 6625%notes may be redeemed on or after November15, 2018, at our option, in whole or in part, at par. The 6625%notes also require that upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the 2010 indenture, the holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the original aggregate principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The 475%notes may be redeemed on or after May 1, 2016, at our option, in whole or in part, at a premium declining from 103563%. The 475%notes may be redeemed on or after May 1, 2019, at our option, in whole or in part, at par. The 475%notes also require that upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the 2013 indenture, the holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the original aggregate principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. Any mandatory repurchase of the 6625% notes an/or the 475% notes would trigger an event of default under our senior credit facilities. We are not required to maintain any financial ratios under either of the indentures.Rent-A-Center and its subsidiary guarantors have fully, jointly and severally, and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of Rent-A-Center with respect to the 6625%notes and the 475% notes. Rent-A-Center has no independent assets or operations, and each subsidiary guarantor is 100% owned directly or indirectly by Rent-A-Center. The only direct or indirect subsidiaries of Rent-A-Center that are not guarantors are minor subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the subsidiary guarantors to transfer funds to Rent-A-Center in the form of loans, advances or dividends, except as provided by applicable law.NoteK Commitments and ContingenciesLeasesWe lease space for substantially all of our Core U.S. and Mexico stores, certain support facilities and the majority of our delivery vehicles under operating leases expiring at various times through 2023.

We reserve for loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. We regularly monitor developments related to these legal proceedings, and review the adequacy of our legal reserves on a quarterly basis. We do not expect these losses to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if and when such losses are incurred. We are subject to unclaimed property audits by states in the ordinary course of business. A comprehensive multi-state unclaimed property audit is currently in progress. The property subject to review in this audit process includes unclaimed wages, vendor payments and customer refunds. State escheat laws generally require entities to report and remit abandoned and unclaimed property to the state. Failure to timely report and remit the property can result in assessments that could include interest and penalties, in addition to the payment of the escheat liability itself. We routinely remit escheat payments to states in compliance with applicable escheat laws. Management believes it is too early to determine the ultimate outcome of this audit, as our remediation efforts are still in process.Franchising GuaranteesOur subsidiary, ColorTyme Finance, Inc. ColorTyme Finance, is a party to an agreement with Citibank, N.A., pursuant to which Citibank provides up to $270 millionin aggregate financing to qualifying franchisees of Franchising. Under the Citibank agreement, upon an event of default by the franchisee under agreements governing this financing and upon the occurrence of certain other events, Citibank can assign the loans and the collateral securing such loans to ColorTyme Finance, with ColorTyme Finance paying or causing to be paid the outstanding debt to Citibank and then succeeding to the rights of Citibank under the debt agreements, including the right to foreclose on the collateral. Rent-A-Center and ColorTyme Finance guarantee the obligations of the franchise borrowers under the Citibank facility. An additional $200 millionof financing is provided by Texas Capital Bank, National Association under an agreement similar to the Citibank financing, which is guaranteed by Rent-A-Center East, Inc., a subsidiary of Rent-A-Center. The maximum guarantee obligations under these agreements, excluding the effects of any amounts that could be recovered under collateralization provisions, is $470 million, of which $164 millionwas outstanding as of December31, 2014.Note L Vendor Settlement CreditWe participated in an anti-trust class-action suit as an entity that indirectly purchased liquid-crystal displays from certain manufacturers during the period from 1999 to 2006. We received net proceeds of approximately $68 millionpursuant to a negotiated settlement of this matter based on the number of LCD units purchased during that time period. The settlement proceeds are reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014.Note M Other ChargesStore Consolidation Plan.During the second quarter of 2014, we closed 150 Core U.S. stores and merged those accounts into existing Core U.S. stores as part of a multi-year program designed to transform and modernize our operations company-wide in order to improve profitability in the Core U.S. segment. The decision to close these stores was based on management analysis and evaluation of the markets in which we operate, including our market share, operating results, competitive positioning and growth potential for the affected stores. The store closures resulted in pre-tax restructuring charges of $49 millionfor the year ended December 31, 2014. The charges included approximately $13 millionin early lease termination costs, $32 millionof 64RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedaccelerated depreciation expense for fixed assets, leasehold improvements and write-off of merchandise inventory and $04 millionof other operating costs to decommission the stores. We did not record a liability for future lease obligations on these properties as the fair value of the liability at the cease-use date was reduced to zero by estimated sublease rentals that could be obtained for the properties. Accordingly, future lease obligations of approximately $21 millionthat remain as of December 31, 2014, will either be expensed monthly or recognized in full upon negotiation of early termination and are scheduled to be paid out through 2016. Corporate Restructuring.During the third quarter of 2014, we eliminated certain departments and functions in our field support center as a part of our efforts to transform and modernize our operations company-wide. This resulted in restructuring charges of approximately $28 millionfor severance and other payroll-related costs. Impairment Charge.During the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a $46 millionimpairment charge related to internally-developed computer software that was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2014. We determined that certain components developed for our new store management information system would not be utilized.Mexico Store Closures. During 2014, management identified 8 stores in Mexico that will be closed inearly 2015. Leasehold improvements and certain other assets will be abandoned upon the closure of the stores, and approximately$02 millionofthe accelerated depreciation related to these assets was recognized in 2014.NoteN Stock-Based CompensationWe maintain long-term incentive plans for the benefit of certain employees and directors. Our plans consist of the Rent-A-Center, Inc.

In applying these limitations, the following shares will be deemed not to have been issued: 1shares covered by the unexercised portion of an option that terminates, expires, or is canceled or settled in cash, and 2shares that are forfeited or subject to awards that are forfeited, canceled, terminated or settled in cash. At December31, 2014and 2013, there were 1,955,950and 1,729,969shares, respectively, allocated to equity awards outstanding in the 2006 Plan.We acquired the Equity Incentive Plan formerly known as the Rent-Way, Inc. 2006 Equity Incentive Plan in conjunction with our acquisition of Rent-Way in 2006. There were 2,468,461shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan. There were 1,269,197and 1,020,361shares allocated to equity awards outstanding in the Equity Incentive Plan at December31, 2014and 2013, respectively.Under the Prior Plan, 14,562,865shares of Rent-A-Centers common stock were reserved for issuance under stock options, stock appreciation rights or restricted stock grants. There were no grants of stock appreciation rights and all equity awards were granted with fixed prices. At December31, 2014and 2013, there were 48,349and 97,499shares,respectively, allocated to equity awards outstanding under the Prior Plan. The Prior Plan was terminated on May19, 2006, upon the approval by our stockholders of the 2006 Plan.Options granted to our employees generally become exercisable over a period of 1to 4years from the date of grant and may be exercised up to a maximum of 10years from the date of grant. Options granted to directors were immediately exercisable.We grant restricted stock units to certain employees that vest after a three-year service requirement has been met. We recognize expense for these awards using the straight-line method over the requisite service period based on the number of awards expected to vest. We also grant performance-based restricted stock units that vest between 0% and 200%depending on our achievement of performance metrics that are established at the date of grant for the subsequent three-year period. We record expense for these awards over the requisite service period using an estimate of the number of awards that will vest, based on our performance against the established metrics, and net of the expected forfeiture rate, since the employee must maintain employment to vest in the award65RENT-A-CENTER, INC.

Deferred Compensation Plan the Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan for a select group of our key management personnel and highly compensated employees who do not participate in the Rent-A-Center, Inc. 401k Retirement Savings Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan first became available to eligible employees in July 2007, with deferral elections taking effect as of August3, 2007.The Deferred Compensation Plan allows participants to defer up to 50%of their base compensation and up to 100%of any bonus compensation. Participants may invest the amounts deferred in measurement funds that are the same funds offered as the investment options in the Rent-A-Center, Inc. 401k Retirement Savings Plan. We may make discretionary contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan, which are subject to a three-year graded vesting schedule based on the participants years of service with us. We are obligated to pay the deferred compensation amounts in the future in accordance with the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. Assets and associated liabilities of the Deferred Compensation Plan are included in prepaid and other assets and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012, we made matching cash contributions of $03 million, $04 millionand $06 million, respectively, which represents 50%of the employees contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan up to an amount not to exceed 4% of each employee respective compensation. No other discretionary contributions were made for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012. The deferred compensation plan liability was approximately $97 millionand $83 millionas of December31, 2014and 2013, respectively67RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedNote P 401k PlanWe sponsor a defined contribution pension plan under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code for certain employees who have completed at least three months of service. Employees may elect to contribute up to 50%of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis, subject to limitations. We may make discretionary contributions to the 401k plan. Employer matching contributions are subject to a three-year graded vesting schedule based on the participant years of service with us. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012, we made matching cash contributions of $67 million, $66 millionand $53 million, respectively, which represents 50%of the employees contributions to the 401k plan up to an amount not to exceed 4%of each employee respective compensation. Employees are permitted to elect to purchase our common stock as part of their 401k plan. As of December31, 2014and 2013, 72%and 68%, respectively, of the total plan assets consisted of our common stock.NoteQ Fair ValueWe use a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which classifies the inputs used in measuring fair values, in determining the fair value of our non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, which consist primarily of goodwill. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. There were no changes in the methods and assumptions used in measuring fair value during the period.At December31, 2014, our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, senior debt and senior notes. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximates fair value at December31, 2014and 2013, because of the short maturities of these instruments. Our senior debt is variable rate debt that re-prices frequently and entails no significant change in credit risk and, as a result, fair value approximates carrying value. The fair value of our senior notes is based on Level 1 inputs and was as follows at December 31, 2014 and 2013 in thousands:December 31, 2014December 31, 2013Carrying ValueFair ValueDifferenceCarrying ValueFair ValueDifference6625% senior  senior  Stock Repurchase PlanUnder our current common stock repurchase program, our Board of Directors has authorized the purchase, from time to time, in the open market and privately negotiated transactions, of up to an aggregate of $125 billionof Rent-A-Center common stock. We have repurchased a total of 36,994,653shares of Rent-A-Center common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $9948 millionas of December31, 2014and 2013, under this common stock repurchase program. No shares were repurchased during 2014.NoteSSegment InformationThe operating segments reported below are the segments for which separate financial information is available and for which segment results are evaluated by the chief operating decision makers. Our operating segments are organized based on factors including, but not limited to, type of business transactions, geographic location and store ownership. All operating segments offer merchandise from four basic product categories: consumer electronics, appliances, computers, furniture and accessories.From January 1, 2012, when we began to provide operating results by segment, through December 31, 2013, management reported four segments including Core U.S., Acceptance Now, International and Franchising. Costs incurred at our corporate headquarters that benefit our Core U.S., Acceptance Now and Mexico segments were allocated to those segments based on segment revenue to determine segment operating profit. Because our Franchising segment maintains a separate, independent corporate office, no additional corporate costs or assets were allocated to that segment.On January 1, 2014, the Company realigned its reporting structure to include its Canadian stores in the Core U.S. segment, which were previously reported in the International segment. The accompanying prior year amounts and store counts have been 68RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedrevised to reflect this change, and we now refer to the segment formerly reported as International as Mexico since only that country results are reported therein. During the fourth quarter of 2014, management reevaluated its operating segments and segment reporting, and determined that the chief operating decision makers relied more heavily on operating profit before corporate allocations when evaluating segment performance than operating profit after corporate allocations. Therefore, we are no longer allocating corporate costs and assets to the segments. In the following tables, segment operating profit is presented before corporate allocations. Corporate costs, which are primarily costs incurred at our U.S. corporate headquarters, are reported separately to reconcile to operating profit reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The costs incurred at our Mexico field support center is reported in the Mexico segment because our Executive Vice President of Mexico Operations is responsible for Mexico operations and its field support center. The Franchising segment corporate costs are reported in the Franchising segment because the President of RAC Franchising International is responsible for that segment operations and corporate functions. Certain corporate assets used to support our Core U.S., Acceptance Now and Mexico segments, including the land and building in which the corporate headquarters are located and related property assets, cash and prepaid expenses were also allocated historically to these operating segments based on segment revenue. In the following tables, corporate assets are reported separately to reconcile to the consolidated balance sheets. Management believes that these changes provide investors with a more precise view of field operations and corporate costs that accurately aligns with management view of the business. Reportable segments and their respective operations are defined as follows:Our Core U.S. segment primarily operates rent-to-own stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico whose customers enter into weekly, semi-monthly or monthly rental purchase agreements, which renew automatically upon receipt of each payment. We retain the title to the merchandise during the term of the rental purchase agreement and ownership passes to the customer if the customer has continuously renewed the rental purchase agreement through the end of the term or exercises a specified early purchase option. This segment also includes the 45stores operating in two states that utilize a retail model which generates installment credit sales through a retail sale transaction. Segment assets include cash, receivables, rental merchandise, property assets, goodwill and other intangible assets. Our Acceptance Now segment operates kiosks within various traditional retailers locations where we generally offer the rent-to-own transaction to consumers who do not qualify for financing from the traditional retailer. The transaction offered is generally similar to that of the Core U.S. segment; however, the majority of the customers in this segment enter into monthly rather than weekly agreements. Segment assets include cash, rental merchandise, property assets, goodwill and other intangible assets. Our Mexico segment currently consists of our company-owned rent-to-own stores in Mexico. The nature of this segment operations and assets are the same as our Core U.S. segment.The stores in our Franchising segment use Rent-A-Centers, ColorTymes or RimTymes trade names, service marks, trademarks and logos, and operate under distinctive operating procedures and standards. Franchisings primary source of revenue is the sale of rental merchandise to its franchisees who, in turn, offer the merchandise to the general public for rent or purchase under a rent-to-own program. As franchisor, Franchising receives royalties of 20%to 60%of the franchisees' monthly gross revenue and initial fees for new locations. Segment assets include cash, franchise fee receivables, property assets and intangible assets.Segment information as of and for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012is as follows in thousands:Year Ended December 31,201420132012RevenuesCore    INC.
