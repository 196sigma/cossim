Our management used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 COSO framework to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management believes that the COSO framework is a suitable framework for its evaluation of financial reporting because it is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of our internal control over financial reporting, is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting.Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as ofDecember31, 2015and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting was effective.Our independent registered public accounting firm, Squar Milner LLP, has audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
