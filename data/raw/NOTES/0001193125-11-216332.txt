NOTE 1 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations Schmitt Industries, Inc. the Company
designs, manufactures, and markets computer controlled vibration detection and balancing equipment primarily to the machine tool industry. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Schmitt Measurement Systems, Inc., the Company designs, manufactures and
markets precision laser-based surface measurement systems for the disk drive, silicon wafer and optics industries; laser-based distance measurement and dimensional sizing products for a wide variety of commercial and industrial applications; and
ultrasonic measurement products that accurately measure the fill levels of large liquefied propane tanks and transmit that data via satellite to a secure web site. Principles of Consolidation These consolidated financial statements
include those of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Schmitt Measurement Systems, Inc. SMS, Schmitt Europe, Ltd. SEL and Schmitt Industries Canada Limited. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes revenue for sales and billing for freight charges upon delivery of the product to the customer at a fixed and
determinable price with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer as indicated by shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations, pursuant to the guidance provided by Accounting Standards Codification
ASC Topic 605. For sales to all customers, including manufacturer representatives, distributors or their third-party customers, these criteria are met at the time product is shipped. When other significant obligations remain after
products are delivered, revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled. In addition, judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers. Credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized
until we have determined that collectability is reasonably assured. Cash Equivalents 
The Company generally invests excess cash in money market funds and investment grade highly liquid securities. The Company considers
securities that are highly liquid, readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of less than three months when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Companys cash consists of demand deposits in large financial institutions. At
times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. Accounts Receivable 
The Company maintains credit limits for all customers based upon several factors, including but not limited to payment history, published
credit reports and use of credit references. Management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value. This review includes using accounts receivable agings,
other operating trends and relevant business conditions, including general economic factors, as they relate to each of the Company domestic and international customers. If these analyses lead management to the conclusion that potential significant
accounts are uncollectible, a reserve is provided. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $21,580 and $23,387 as of May31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements For The Years Ended May 31, 2011 and 2010 
Inventories Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the average cost basis. Costs included in inventories consist of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, which are related
to the purchase or production of inventories. Write-downs, when required, are made to reduce excess inventories to their net realizable values. Such estimates are based on assumptions regarding future demand and market conditions. If actual
conditions become less favorable than the assumptions used, an additional inventory write-down may be required. As of May31, 2011 and 2010, inventories consisted of: May31,2011 May31,2010 Raw materials 1,649,925 1,070,902 Work-in-process 892,541 980,971 Finished goods 1,603,942 1,593,430 
4,146,408 3,645,303 
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of three to seven years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment; three years
for vehicles; and twenty-five years for buildings and improvements. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Financial statements for the Companys
subsidiaries outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted average exchange rates for income and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are included as a
separate component of stockholders equity titled Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Transaction gains and losses are included in net income loss. Advertising Advertising costs included in general, administrative and
selling, are expensed when the advertising first takes place. Advertising expense was $70,411 and $56,463 for the fiscal years ended May31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs,
predominately internal labor costs and costs of materials, are charged to expense when incurred. Stock-Based Compensation 
Stock-based compensation includes expense charges for all stock-based awards to employees and directors granted under the Companys
stock option plan. The Company has adopted ASC Topic 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors including stock options based on estimated fair values. 
Stock-based compensation recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of the stock-based award that will vest during
the period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Compensation cost for all stock-based awards is recognized using the straight-line method.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements For The Years Ended May 31, 2011 and 2010 
Income Taxes The Company applies the asset and liability method in recording income taxes, under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined, based on the differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws. Additionally, deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company currently has a valuation allowance against all of their net deferred tax assets. Management continues to review the level of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. There can
be no assurance that the Companys future operations will produce sufficient earnings so that the deferred tax asset can be fully utilized. Intangible Assets Amortizable intangible assets, which include purchased
technology and patents, are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to seventeen years. As of May31, 2011 and 2010, amortizable intangible assets were $2,200,883 and accumulated amortization was $853,336 and $697,212,
respectively. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $135,000 in Fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014, $119,000 in Fiscal 2015 and $112,000 in Fiscal 2016. Intangible and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is
determined by comparing the forecasted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate, based on management best estimates using the appropriate assumptions and projections at the time, to the carrying amount of the assets. If
the carrying value is determined to be in excess of future operating cash flows, the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. As of
May31, 2011, management did not believe impairment, as defined above, existed. Earnings Loss Per Share 
Basic earnings loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings loss per
share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for dilutive incremental shares attributed to outstanding options to purchase common stock. Common stock equivalents for stock options are computed using the
treasury stock method. In periods in which a net loss is incurred, no common stock equivalents are included since they are antidilutive and as such all stock options outstanding are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss in those periods.
66,489 and 78,241 potentially dilutive common shares from outstanding stock options have been excluded from diluted earnings loss per share for the years ended May31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk are trade accounts receivable. Credit terms generally include a discount of 15% if the invoice is paid within ten
days, with the net amount payable in 30 days. Financial Instruments 
The carrying value of all other financial instruments potentially subject to valuation risk principally consisting of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable also approximate fair value because of their short-term maturities.

Shipping and Handling Charges 
The Company incurs costs related to shipping and handling of its manufactured products. These costs are expensed as incurred as a
component of cost of sales. Shipping and handling charges related to the receipt of raw materials are also incurred, which are recorded as a cost of the related inventory. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2009-13,
Revenue Recognition Topic 605: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ASU 2009-13, which provides amendments to the criteria in ASC Subtopic 605-25,
Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements, for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements and expands the disclosures related to multiple deliverable arrangements. ASU 2009-13 is effective prospectively
for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010. The Company adopted ASU 2009-13 on June1, 2010. The Companys adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on
its consolidated financial statements. 
NOTE 2 
LINE OF CREDIT In February 2011, the Company renewed its $10 million bank line of credit agreement secured by U.S. accounts receivable, inventories and general intangibles which expires on March1, 2012. Interest
is payable at the banks prime rate 325% as of May31, 2011 or LIBOR plus 20%, 219% as of May31, 2011. There were no outstanding balances on the line of credit at May31, 2011 and 2010. 
NOTE 3 
LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS As of May31, 2011, there were no outstanding obligations under capital leases or purchase contracts. The Company leases certain facilities and equipment to support operations under non-cancelable
operating leases and other contractual obligations. Total rent expense for the years ended May31, 2011 and 2010 amounted to $56,913 and $36,348, respectively. The approximate future minimum commitments under leases and contractual obligations for each of the years ending May31 are as follows:  Years ending May31 2012 37,162 2013 36,768 2014 29,842  30  Schmitt Industries, Inc.

Gross deferred tax assets 1,572,069 1,568,116 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance 1,572,069 1,568,116 
Net deferred tax asset 
Deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not
that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has recorded a substantial deferred tax asset related to temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. During Fiscal 2011, the Company
increased its valuation allowance $3,953 as a result of the write-down of deferred tax assets. During Fiscal 2010, the Company increased its valuation allowance $665,025 as a result of the write-down of deferred tax assets. The Company has provided
a full valuation allowance against all of its deferred tax assets as the recent losses have been given more weight than projected future income when determining the need for a valuation allowance. 
The Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $16 million which expire in 2029 and 2030 along with the
federal general business and other credit carryforwards. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $25 million which expire in 2024 and 2025.

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes determined by
applying the U.S. statutory federal tax rate to pre-tax loss due to the following:  YearsendedMay31 2011 2010 Statutory federal tax rate 340 340 State taxes, net of federal benefit 44 44 Change in deferred tax valuation allowance 238 392 Stock-based compensation 338 19 RE tax credits 294 36 Effect of foreign income tax rates 20 03 Permanent and other differences 90 15 
Effective tax rate 08 09 
Each year the Company files income tax returns in the various federal, state and local income taxing
jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax returns are subject to examination and possible challenge by the taxing authorities. Positions challenged by the taxing authorities may be settled or appealed by the Company. As a result, there is an
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Companys financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 740. The Company applies this guidance by defining criteria that an individual income tax position must meet for any part of the benefit
of that position to be recognized in an enterprises financial statements and provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, accounting for interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The
liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $0 as of May31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest and penalties
associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized as components of the Provision for income taxes. The liability for payment of interest and penalties was $0 as of May31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
Several tax years are subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. In the United States, federal tax years for Fiscal 2007 and
after are subject to examination. In the United Kingdom, tax years for Fiscal 2006 and after are subject to examination. In Canada, tax years for 2005 and after are subject to examination. In the United States, returns related to an acquired
subsidiary for the year ended October31, 1994 and final return for the period ended May19, 1995 are also subject to examination.

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION The Board of Directors adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan 2004 Plan in August 2004 and the 1995 Stock Option Plan 1995 Plan in December 1995, which plan was amended in August 1996 and restated in
August 1998. An option granted under the 2004 Plan and/or 1995 Plan the Plans might be either an incentive stock option ISO, or a nonstatutory stock option NSO. ISOs may be granted only to employees and members of the Board of Directors of the
Company and are subject to certain limitations, in addition to restrictions applicable to all stock options under the Plan. Options not meeting these limitations will be treated as NSOs. The purchase price of ISOs is fair market value on the date of
grant; the purchase price of NSOs may vary from fair market value. Vesting is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, but is either 50% at grant date and 167% on each anniversary thereafter or 25% at grant date
and 25% on each anniversary thereafter. The Company initially reserved 400,000 shares for issuance under the 1995 Plan and 300,000 shares for issuance under the 2004 Plan. The 1995 Plan expired in December 2005 and no additional options may be
issued under the 1995 Plan, although expiration of the 1995 Plan did not affect the rights of persons who received stock grants under the 1995 Plan. Stock-based compensation recognized in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the
years ended May31, 2011 and 2010 includes compensation cost for stock-based awards granted. All outstanding options will expire no later than 2021. Upon adoption of ASC Topic 718, the Company continued to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method of valuation for stock-based awards. The Companys determination of the fair value of
stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. Although the fair value of stock-based awards is
34  Schmitt Industries, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements For The Years Ended May 31, 2011 and 2010 
determined in accordance with ASC Topic 718, the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing
results. These variables include, but are not limited to:  Risk-Free Interest Rate. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an
equivalent remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award.  Expected Life. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. The Company
determines the expected life based on historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and pre-vesting and post-vesting forfeitures.  Expected Volatility. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of its
common stock. The volatility factor the Company uses is based on its historical stock prices over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the award. These historical periods may exclude portions of time when unusual
transactions occurred.  Expected Dividend Yield. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the Company uses an
expected dividend yield of zero.  Expected Forfeitures. The Company uses relevant historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures. The Company records stock-based
compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest. The Company has computed, to determine
stock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended May31, 2011 and 2010, the value of all stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by ASC Topic 718 using the following assumptions:

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Schmitt Industries, Inc. as of May31, 2011 and 2010 and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
