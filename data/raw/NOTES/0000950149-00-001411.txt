ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA             Report of Independent Auditors
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Geoworks Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Geoworks
Corporation as of March 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 2000. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Geoworks
Corporation at March 31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.                       /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES COMPANY
Geoworks Corporation the Company is a provider of mobile e-commerce and
information services, software and professional technical services. The Company
has previously developed and marketed operating system and application software
for the wireless device market and many of its current service offerings are
based on the technology it has developed. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries located in Japan and the United Kingdom. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain fiscal year 1999 and 1998 balances have been reclassified to conform to
the fiscal year 2000 presentation. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Company international subsidiaries use the local currency as their
functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in
effect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expense accounts are
translated at average exchange rates during each period. Resulting translation
adjustments are recorded directly to a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material. USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.                                        38

Geoworks Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED REVENUE RECOGNITION
Professional services revenues are generally billed and recognized based on time
and materials expended by the Company at contracted rates.
Research and development fees are primarily amounts received pursuant to
contracts with original equipment manufacturers OEMs under which the Company
is reimbursed for a portion of its development costs related to specific
products up to the amounts specified in the contracts. The Company is typically
paid by the OEM as it achieves certain project milestones. Revenue under these
research and development arrangements is recognized under the
percentage-of-completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to
date to total anticipated project costs.
License and other revenue includes revenue from hardware manufacturers that
incorporate the Company software products into their systems and service
revenues resulting from support contracts provided in connection with the
Company licensed technology. In addition, the Company has licensed certain
technology and intellectual property and sold source code to third parties to be
used in the development of their own service offerings and products. Revenues
from products or technology licensed to OEMs and revenue sharing agreements are
recognized when the related products or technology is accepted by the OEM or
customer. Advance payments of license fees prepaid royalties are recorded as
deferred revenue and recognized as license revenue as products containing the
licensed software are sold and reported by the licensee. If an OEM license
agreement is terminated through contract termination or as a result of product
discontinuation, any remaining deferred revenue related to unamortized prepaid
royalties is recognized as revenue, provided that the Company has no obligations
remaining under the agreement. Revenues from the license of technology,
intellectual property, and sale of source code are recognized when the Company
has performed under the terms of the related contract and such revenues can be
determined, if such amounts are based on revenue sharing or some other
calculation. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid
securities with original maturities of three months or less and are stated at
cost, which approximates fair value.                                        39

Geoworks Corporation
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued MARKETABLE SECURITIES
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities FAS No.
115, the Company is required to determine the appropriate classification of
its debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such
designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company has classified all of its
marketable securities as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at amounts which approximate fair
value. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than
temporary on available-for-sale debt and equity securities are included in
interest and other income.
The Company marketable securities consist of equity securities, principally
mutual funds, at March 31, 2000 and 1999. Unrealized gains and losses at March
31, 2000 and 1999, and realized gains and losses for the years then ended, were
not significant. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE
The Company has not capitalized any software development expenses for its
products as such expenses have been incurred prior to the Company products
attaining technological feasibility or such costs have been reimbursed by third
parties in connection with OEM license agreements. Software development expenses
incurred for product enhancements after the product has reached technological
feasibility have not been material and, accordingly, have been charged to
operations as incurred. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are
computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of three to
four years. Assets acquired under capital lease obligations and leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of
the useful lives of the assets or the terms of the leases.                                        40

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE
Research and development expense includes both internally funded development and
projects funded in part by customers. Total research and development expenses on
projects for which OEM funding was received were $182,000, $4,317,000, and
$7,590,000 for fiscal years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively, of which
$320,000, $3,315,000, and $7,266,000 was funded and recognized as revenue in
fiscal years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Revenues from three major customers accounted for 39%, 31% and 18%, respectively
of net revenues for fiscal year 2000. Revenues from three major customers
accounted for 57%, 17%, and 16%, respectively of net revenues for fiscal year
1999. Revenues from four major customers accounted for 29%, 18%, 16% and 11 respectively of total revenues for fiscal year 1998.
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123, the Company has
elected to apply the intrinsic-value method under Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for
its stock option and stock purchase plans. A summary of the pro forma effects on
reported net loss and net loss per share for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 as
if the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair
value of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by FAS 123 is presented
in Note 5.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted net loss per share information for all periods is presented
under the requirements of FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share FAS
128. Basic earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and excludes any
dilutive effects of outstanding stock options. Potentially dilutive stock
options have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as
their inclusion would also be antidilutive. If the Company had reported net
income, the calculation of diluted earnings per share would have included the
effect of common equivalent shares related to outstanding stock options Note

In accordance with FAS 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information public business enterprises are required to report
financial and other information about operating segments of the entity for which
such information is available and is utilized by the chief operating decision
maker. FAS 131 also establishes standards for related disclosures about
products and services, geographic areas, and major customers see Note 9. The
Company operates as one business segment. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS No. 133. FAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as
derivatives, and for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivatives
Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 133 FAS No. 137. FAS No. 133, as amended by FAS No. 137,
is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2000, with earlier application encouraged. The Company does not currently,
nor do we currently intend in the future, to use derivative instruments and
therefore do not expect that the adoption of FAS No. 133 will have any impact
on our financial position or results of operations.
In December 1999, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements SAB No. 101. SAB No. 101, which was effective January 1, 2000,
requires that license and other up front fees received from research
collaborators be recognized over the term of the agreement, unless the fee is in
exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the
culmination of a separate earnings process. The implementation of SAB No. 101 is
not anticipated to have a material change on our financial statements.                                        42

3. LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS
In connection with the transfer of certain technology and rights to two
privately held companies, Wink Communications, Inc. Wink and Global PC, Inc.
Global PC, the Company received a minority equity interest in each of these
companies in previous fiscal years. These equity securities are classified as
available for sale. The costs of developing the related technologies were
previously charged to operations; accordingly no value had been attributed to
these interests in the consolidated financial statements reported for periods
prior to August 1999.
In August 1999, Wink completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
Therefore, the carrying value of the Company investment in Wink $16,380,000
at March 31, 2000 is determined based on the closing price of Wink common
shares at each balance sheet date. The fair value of this asset is included in
long-term investments and it will fluctuate with the market price of Wink common
shares. The unrealized gain on the Wink shares, which is equal to the fair value
of the investment, is included in stockholders' equity. Gains recognized on the
sale of Wink shares, which amounted to $4,049,000 in fiscal year 2000, are
reported as other income.
In December 1999, the assets of Global PC were acquired by MYTURN.com MYTN,
a publicly traded company. In connection with the acquisition, the Company
signed a licensing agreement with MYTN. Per the terms of the agreement, the
Company has also been granted warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of MYTN common
stock at $450 per share. The warrants are exercisable beginning April 22, 2000
and expire in December 2004. The Company has the right to have the shares
underlying the warrants included in registration statements filed on behalf of
MYTN and to require MYTN to file such registration statements, subject to

restrictions, beginning May 15, 2000. The fair value of the Company MYTN
warrants $4,797,000 at March 31, 2000 is included in long-term investments.
The value of this investment will fluctuate with the market price of MYTN
shares. The unrealized gain on these warrants, which is equal to the investment
balance, is included in stockholders' equity.

5. INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes FAS 109, under
which the liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
expected to reverse.
The income tax provisions of $452,000, $149,000 and $148,000 for fiscal years
2000 and 1999 and 1998, respectively, consist primarily of foreign withholding
tax payments made with respect to royalties received from original equipment
manufacturers.                                        44

The notes receivable from stockholders arose from the exercise of 51,563 stock
options and the sale of 50,000 shares of the Company common stock to officers,
which are secured by the shares of common stock issued as well as deeds of trust
on each such officer principal residence. The notes accrue interest at 60%
and are due on February 8, 2005 and August 10, 2004.                                        49

10. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company recorded restructuring
charges of approximately $18 million as a result of actions taken to better
align its cost structure with revenue projections as the Company shifted its
resources to support a business plan focused on opportunities in the mobile
e-commerce and information services market. During the quarter, the Company
terminated approximately 27% of its workforce, vacated one facility and
consolidated those operations in a remaining facility, which is also partially
vacant. The restructure charges consist of severance costs for the termination
of 33 employees, 32 of which were terminated prior to March 31, 1999, as well as
related charges for the write-off of property and equipment and the accrual of
lease commitment liabilities net of expected sublease income as a result of
these actions.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company negotiated a release from
the remainder of the lease of the facility previously vacated in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1999. Also, based on improved operating results and improved
business opportunities, the Company will now fully occupy the space in its
primary facility that it had previously intended to vacate. The Company did not
utilize this space in fiscal 2000. As a result of these actions, the remaining
lease commitment accrual, $589,000, was reversed.                                        51

LEGAL ACTIONS
In January 2000, the Company initiated a licensing program for its patented
flexible user interface technology Flex UI based on its belief that
WAP-compliant or WAP-enabled products use this technology. On April 25, 2000,
Phone.com, Inc., filed a declaratory relief action against the Company in the
United States District Court in San Francisco, California seeking to invalidate
the Flex UI patent. On June 15, 2000 the Company responded by filing an answer
and counterclaim alleging infringement by Phone.com. The expenses required to
pursue legal remedies could be significant. Although Company management believes
it has adequate resources to support the Company position, the outcome of the
related litigation is uncertain. Litigation, regardless of its outcome, could
result in significant expenses and be a diversion of the Company resources and
could have a material adverse effect on the Company operating results and
financial condition.                                        52
