86 49 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting,
as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our
system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving
financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to
lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial
reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such
limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are
known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the
process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2005. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Based on our managements assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2005, based on those criteria. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their audit report, which appears
herein. 50 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Denbury Resources Inc. We have completed integrated audits of Denbury Resources Inc.s 2005 and 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated Financial Statements In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Denbury Resources Inc.
and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December31, 2005 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal Control over Financial Reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over
financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 51 Table of Contents continued from page 51 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 57 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies Organization and Nature of Operations Denbury Resources Inc. is a Delaware corporation, organized under Delaware General
Corporation Law, engaged in the acquisition, development, operation and exploration of oil and
natural gas properties. Denbury has one primary business segment, which is the exploration,
development and production of oil and natural gas in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. We also own
the rights to a natural source of carbon dioxide CO2 reserves that we
use for injection in our tertiary oil recovery operations. We also sell some of the CO2
we produce to Genesis see Note 3 and to third party industrial users. Principles of Reporting and Consolidation The consolidated financial statements herein have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles GAAPand include the accounts of Denbury and its
subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. In 2002, one of our subsidiaries acquired the
general partner of Genesis Energy, L.P. Genesis, a publicly traded master limited
partnership. During 2003, we acquired additional Genesis limited partnership units,
increasing our ownership interest in Genesis from 2% to 925%. We account for our ownership
interest in Genesis under the equity method of accounting. Even though we have significant
influence over the limited partnership in our role as general partner, because our control is
limited by the general partnership agreement we do not consolidate Genesis. See Note 3 for
more information regarding our related party transactions with Genesis and summary financial
information. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. We
have evaluated our consolidation of variable interest entities in accordance with FASB
Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and have concluded that
we do not have any variable interest entities that would require consolidation. Effective December29, 2003, Denbury Resources Inc. changed its corporate structure to a
holding company format. The purposes of creating the holding company structure were to better
reflect the operating practices and methods of Denbury, to improve its economics, and to
provide greater administrative and operational flexibility. As part of this restructure,
Denbury Resources Inc. predecessor entity merged into a newly formed limited liability
company and survived as Denbury Onshore, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an
indirect subsidiary of the newly formed holding company, Denbury Holdings, Inc. Denbury
Holdings, Inc. subsequently assumed the name Denbury Resources Inc. new entity. The
reorganization was structured as a tax-free reorganization to Denburys stockholders and all
outstanding capital stock of the original public company was automatically converted into the
identical number of and type of shares of the new public holding company. Stockholders
ownership interests in the business did not change as a result of the new structure and shares
of the Company remained publicly traded under the same symbol DNRon the New York Stock
Exchange. Stock Split On October19, 2005, stockholders of Denbury Resources Inc. approved an amendment to our
Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of our authorized common
stock from 100,000,000 shares to 250,000,000 shares and to split our common stock on a 2-for-1
basis. Stockholders of record on October31, 2005, received one additional share of Denbury common
stock for each share of common stock held at that time. Information pertaining to shares and
earnings per share has been retroactively adjusted in the accompanying financial statements and
related notes thereto to reflect the stock split, except for our December31, 2004 balance sheet,
which has not been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Oil and Natural Gas Operations a Capitalized costs. We follow the full-cost method of accounting for oil and
natural gas properties. Under this method, all costs related to acquisitions, exploration and
development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized and accumulated in a single cost
center representing our activities, which are undertaken exclusively in the United States.
Such costs include lease acquisition costs, geological and geophysical expenditures, lease
rentals on undeveloped properties, costs of drilling both productive and non-productive wells
and general and administrative expenses directly related to exploration and development
activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or
similar activities. 58 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated costs
except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves, in which case a gain or
loss is recognized. b Depletion and depreciation. The costs capitalized, including production
equipment, are depleted or depreciated on the unit-of-production method, based on proved oil
and natural gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers. Oil and natural
gas reserves are converted to equivalent units based upon the relative energy content which is
six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil. c Asset Retirement Obligations. On January1, 2003, we
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. In general, our future asset retirement
obligations relate to future costs associated with plugging and abandonment of our oil and
natural gas wells, removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such
land to its original condition. SFAS No143 requires that the fair value of a liability for
an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred, discounted
to its present value using our credit adjusted risk-free interest rate, and a corresponding
amount capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The
liability is accreted each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful
life of the related asset. Revisions to estimated retirement obligations will result in an
adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability. If the liability is
settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is recorded to the full
cost pool, unless significant. Prior to the adoption of this new standard, we recognized a
provision for our asset retirement obligations each period as part of our depletion and
depreciation calculation, based on the unit-of-production method. See Note 4 for more
information regarding our change in accounting related to the adoption of SFAS No143. d Ceiling test. The net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties
are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling. The cost center
ceiling is defined as the sum of ithe present value of estimated future net revenues from
proved reserves before future abandonment costs discounted at 10%, based on unescalated
period-end oil and natural gas prices; iiplus the cost of properties not being amortized;
iiiplus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the
costs being amortized, if any; ivless related income tax effects. The cost center ceiling
test is prepared quarterly. e Joint interest operations. Substantially all of our oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities are conducted jointly with others. These financial
statements reflect only Denburys proportionate interest in such activities and any amounts
due from other partners are included in trade receivables. f Proved Reserves. See Note 14 for information on our proved oil and natural
gas reserves and the basis on which they are recorded. Property and equipment Other Other property and equipment, which includes furniture and fixtures, vehicles, computer
equipment and software, and capitalized leases, is depreciated principally on a straight-line
basis over estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives are generally as follows: vehicles
and furniture and fixtures 5 to 10years; and computer equipment and software 3 to 5
years. Leased property meeting certain capital lease criteria is capitalized and the present
value of the related lease payments is recorded as a liability. Amortization of capitalized
leased assets is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful life or the initial lease term. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the time oil and natural gas is produced and sold. Any amounts
due from purchasers of oil and natural gas are included in accrued production receivable. We follow the sales method of accounting for our oil and natural gas revenue, whereby we
recognize revenue on all oil or natural gas sold to our purchasers regardless of whether the
sales are proportionate to our ownership in the property. A receivable or liability is
recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance 59 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on a specific property greater than
the expected remaining proved reserves. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, our aggregate oil
and natural gas imbalances were not material to our consolidated financial statements. We recognize revenue and expenses of purchased producing properties at the time we assume
effective control, commencing from either the closing or purchase agreement date, depending on
the underlying terms and agreements. We follow the same methodology in reverse when we sell
properties by recognizing revenue and expenses of the sold properties until either the closing
or purchase agreement date, depending on the underlying terms and agreements. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated
with future oil and natural gas production. These contracts have historically consisted of
options, in the form of price floors or collars, and fixed price swaps. In accordance with SFAS
No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, derivative
financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured
at fair value. Effective January1, 2005, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our oil
and natural gas derivative contracts and accordingly de-designated our derivative instruments from
hedge accounting treatment. As a result of this change, we began accounting for our oil and
natural gas derivative contracts as speculative contracts in the first quarter of 2005. As
speculative contracts, the changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in income
in the period of change. Additionally, the balance remaining in accumulated comprehensive income
at December31, 2004, related to the de-designated derivative contracts was amortized over the
remaining life of the contracts, all of which expired in 2005. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily
of cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and accrued production receivables and the
derivative hedging instruments discussed above. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments
represent high-quality securities placed with various investment-grade institutions. This
investment practice limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Our trade and accrued
production receivables are dispersed among various customers and purchasers; therefore,
concentrations of credit risk are limited. Also, most of our significant purchasers are large
companies with excellent credit ratings. If customers are considered a credit risk, letters of
credit are the primary security obtained to support lines of credit. We attempt to minimize our
credit risk exposure to the counterparties of our derivative hedging contracts through formal
credit policies, monitoring procedures and diversification. There are no margin requirements with
the counterparties of our derivative contracts. CO2 Operations We own and produce CO2 reserves that are used for our own tertiary oil recovery
operations, and in addition, we sell a portion to Genesis and to other third party industrial
users. We record revenue from our sales of CO2 to third parties when it is produced and
sold. CO2 used for our own tertiary oil recovery operations is not recorded as revenue
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Expenses related to the production of CO2
are allocated between volumes sold to third parties and volumes used for our own use. The expenses
related to third party sales are recorded in CO2 operating expenses and the expenses
related to our own uses are recorded in Lease operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. We capitalize acquisitions and the costs of exploring and developing CO2
reserves. The costs capitalized are depleted or depreciated on the unit-of-production method,
based on proved CO2 reserves as determined by independent engineers. We evaluate our
CO2 assets for impairment by comparing our expected future revenues from these assets to
their net carrying value. Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments to be cash equivalents if they have maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase. 60 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Short-term Investments Our short-term investments consist primarily of investment grade debt securities that are
classified as available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Available-for-sale securities are stated
at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with the unrealized gain or loss, net of tax,
reported in other comprehensive income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into
earnings over the life of the related security. Dividend and interest income is recognized when
earned. We have no investments that are considered to be trading securities. During the first nine months of 2005, we sold all of our available-for-sale securities. Restricted Cash and Investments At December31, 2005 and 2004, we had approximately $67million and $64million,
respectively, of restricted cash and investments held in escrow accounts for future site
reclamation costs. These balances are recorded at amortized cost and are included in Other
assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated fair market value of these investments
at December31, 2005 and 2004, was virtually the same as amortized cost. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income attributable to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted net income per common share is calculated in the same manner, but also considers
the impact to net income and common shares for the potential dilution from stock options,
restricted stock and any other outstanding convertible securities. For each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005, there were no adjustments
to net income for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income per common share. The
following is a reconciliation of the weighted average shares used in the basic and diluted net
income per common share computations

The weighted average common shares basic amount in 2005 and 2004, excludes 20million
and 23million shares of non-vested restricted stock, respectively, that is subject to future time
vesting requirements. As these restricted shares vest, they will be included in the shares
outstanding used to calculate basic net income per common share. For purposes of calculating
weighted average common shares diluted, the non-vested restricted stock is included in the
computation using the treasury stock method, with the proceeds equal to the average unrecognized
compensation during the period, adjusted for any estimated future tax consequences recognized
directly in equity. The restricted shares were issued in August2004 through January2005 and have
been included in the calculation for the periods they were outstanding. These shares may result in
greater dilution in future periods, depending on the market price of our common stock during those
periods. We excluded stock options representing 184,000 shares in 2005, 80,000 shares in 2004 and
20million shares in 2003 from our diluted shares outstanding because their inclusion would be
antidilutive, as their exercise prices exceeded the average market price of our common stock during
the respective periods. 61 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Stock-Based Compensation We issue stock options and restricted stock to our employees and directors under our stock
option plans, which are described more fully in Note 8. We account for our stock-based employee
compensation utilizing the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations.
Under these principles, no compensation expense for stock options is reflected in net income as
long as the stock options have an exercise price equal to the quoted market price of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. For restricted stock grants, we recognize compensation expense
equal to the intrinsic value of the stock on the date of grant pro-rata over the applicable vesting
periods. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per common share
if we had applied the fair value provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, as amended by SFAS No148, in accounting for our stock-based compensation.

Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method under which deferred income
taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using the
enacted statutory tax rates in effect at year-end. The effect on deferred taxes for a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that
the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of certain assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period.
Management believes its estimates and assumptions are 62 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements reasonable; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates.
Significant estimates underlying these financial statements include ithe fair value of
financial derivative instruments, iithe estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas
reserves used to compute depletion of oil and natural gas properties, the related present
value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom and ceiling test, iiiaccruals related to
oil and gas production and revenues, capital expenditures and lease operating expenses, iv
the estimated costs and timing of future asset retirement obligations, and vestimates made
in the calculation of income taxes. While management is not aware of any significant
revisions to any of its estimates, there will likely be future revisions to its estimates
resulting from matters such as revisions in estimated oil and gas volumes, changes in
ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re-allocations by purchasers or pipelines,
or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and gas industry, many of which require
retroactive application. These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated and will be
recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs. Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year
presentation. Such reclassifications had no impact on our reported net income, current assets,
total assets, current liabilities, total liabilities or stockholders equity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No123R,
Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No123. SFAS No123R supersedes APB 25 and
amends SFAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No123R is
similar to the approach described in SFAS No123. However, SFAS No123R requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on their estimated fair values. We adopted SFAS No123R on January1, 2006, using the modified prospective application
method described in the statement. Under the modified prospective method, we will apply the
standard to new awards granted or modified effective January1, 2006. Also, we will recognize
compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of December31, 2005 over
the remaining service periods. At January1, 2006, we had $166million of unearned compensation
cost related to unvested stock option awards. This compensation cost will be recognized over the
remaining vesting period, which is estimated to be approximately $80million during 2006, $52
million during 2007, $31 million during 2008 and $03million during 2009. These amounts do not
include the impact of any new awards granted in 2006. SFAS No123R also requires the tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation expenses
to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under
current literature. This requirement may serve to reduce Denburys future cash provided by
operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities, to the extent of
associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future; however, it will not have an impact on
the Companys overall cash flows. Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures 2006 Acquisition of Producing and Tertiary Oil Properties In November2005, we entered into an agreement to acquire oil properties located in
Mississippi and Alabama for $248million. At December31, 2005, we had $25million of earnest
money deposited for this pending acquisition, which is included in Deposits on property
acquisitions in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The acquisition closed in January of 2006. See
Note 13, Subsequent Events. 2005 Acquisitions of Producing and Tertiary Oil and Gas Properties Our acquisitions in 2005 included the purchase of additional interest and acreage in the
Barnett Shale area $342million, additional interest in the Eucutta Field $80million, and
the purchase of two oil fields that may be potential tertiary flood candidates in the future, Lake
St. John $161million and Cranfield $11million. 63 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Sale of Denbury Offshore, Inc. On July20, 2004, we closed the sale of Denbury Offshore, Inc., a subsidiary that held our
offshore assets, for $200million before adjustments to Newfield Exploration Company. The sale
price was based on the asset value of the offshore assets as of April1, 2004, which means that the
net operating cash flow defined as revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures from
these properties which we received between April 1 and closing, as well as expenses of the sale and
other contractual adjustments, reduced the purchase price to approximately $187million. We
excluded from the sale a discovery well drilled at High Island A-6 during 2004, and certain deep
rights at West Delta 27 that we sold for $18million in December2004, but retained a carried
interest in a deep exploratory well. Our financial results for 2004 include production, revenues, operating expenses, and capital
expenditures of the offshore properties through July19, 2004. Revenues of Denbury Offshore, Inc.
included in our 2004 results were $626million. We recorded the proceeds from the sale as a
reduction to our full cost pool. We paid approximately $21million of current income taxes
relating to the sale and paid approximately $24million of employee severance costs in 2004. We
used $85million of the sales proceeds to retire our bank debt. Our offshore properties made up approximately 125% of our year-end 2003 proved reserves
approximately 96 Bcfe as of December31, 2003 and represented approximately 25% of our 2004
second quarter production 9,114 BOE/d. 2003 Property Sales In February2003, we sold Laurel Field, acquired in an acquisition from COHO Resources during
2002, for $259million and other consideration which included an interest in Atchafalaya Bay Field
where we already owned an interest and seismic over that area. At December31, 2002, Laurel
Field had approximately 74 MMBbls of proved reserves. In March2003, we sold the Bentonia and
Glazier fields for approximately $16million. The proceeds from the sale of Laurel Field were
used to reduce our bank debt. Note 3. Related Party Transactions Genesis Interest in and Transactions with Genesis On May14, 2002, a newly formed subsidiary of Denbury acquired Genesis Energy, L.L.C.
which was subsequently converted to Genesis Energy, Inc., the general partner of Genesis, a
publicly traded master limited partnership, for total consideration, including expenses and
commissions, of approximately $22million. Genesis primary business activities include
gathering, marketing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, and wholesale marketing
of CO2, primarily in Mississippi, Texas, Alabama and Florida. In November2003,
through our subsidiary general partner, we purchased an additional 689,000 partnership common
units and 14,000 general partner units of Genesis for $715 per unit, with an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $50million. With these additional units, our ownership
interest increased to approximately 925% 20% general partner ownership and 725% limited
partner ownership. In December2005, Genesis issued additional common units in a public
offering. Our subsidiary Genesis Energy, Inc. acquired an additional 91,694 general partner
units and 330,630 common units in this offering for $43million, which maintained our same
ownership interest of approximately 925%. We are accounting for our 925% ownership in Genesis under the equity method of
accounting as we have significant influence over the limited partnership; however, our control
is limited under the limited partnership agreement and therefore we do not consolidate
Genesis. Our equity in Genesis net income lossfor 2005 was $314,000, for 2004 was
$136,000, and for 2003 was $256,000, representing 2% of Genesis net income lossfor the
periods from January1, 2003, through October31, 2003, and 925% of Genesis net income
lossfor the periods from November1, 2003, through December31, 2005. Genesis Energy,
Inc., the general partner of which we own 100%, has guaranteed the bank debt of Genesis, which
consisted of $101million in letters of credit at December31, 2005. There are no guarantees
by Denbury or any of its other subsidiaries of the debt of Genesis or of Genesis Energy, Inc.
Our investment in Genesis of $115million
exceeded our percentage of net equity in the limited partnership at the time of
acquisition by approximately $22million, which represents goodwill and is not subject to
amortization. The fair value of our investment in Genesis was $152million at December31,
2005, based on quoted market values. 64 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Oil Sales and Transportation Services Prior to September2004, including the period prior to our investment in Genesis, we sold
certain of our oil production to Genesis. Beginning in September2004, we discontinued most of our
direct oil sales to Genesis and began to transport our crude oil using Genesis Mississippi common
carrier pipeline to a sales point where it is sold to third party purchasers. For these
transportation services, we pay Genesis a fee for the use of their pipeline and trucking services.
For 2005 and 2004, we expensed $40 and $12million for these transportation services. We
recorded oil sales to Genesis of $46million, $635million and $489million for the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Denbury received other miscellaneous payments
from Genesis, including $120,000 in each year 2005, 2004 and 2003 in director fees for certain
executive officers of Denbury that are board members of Genesis, and $528,000 in 2005, $508,000 in
2004 and $57,000 in 2003 of pro rata dividend distributions from Genesis. Transportation Leases In late 2004 and early 2005, we entered into pipeline transportation agreements with Genesis
to transport in its pipelines our crude oil from Olive, Brookhaven and McComb Fields in Southwest
Mississippi to Genesis main crude oil pipeline in order to improve our ability to market our crude
oil, and to transport CO2 from our main CO2 pipeline to Brookhaven Field for
our tertiary operations. As part of these arrangements, we entered into three transportation
agreements. The first agreement, entered into in November2004, was to transport crude oil from
Olive Field. This agreement is for 10years and has a minimum payment of approximately $18,000 per
month. In December2004, we entered into the second transportation agreement to transport CO2
to Brookhaven Field in Southwest Mississippi. This agreement is for an eight-year period and
has minimum payments of approximately $49,000 per month. In January2005, we entered into a third
transportation agreement to transport crude oil from Brookhaven field. This agreement is for 10
years and has a minimum payment of approximately $32,000 per month. The minimum monthly payment in
each agreement will increase for any volumes transported in excess of a stated monthly volume in
the contract. Currently, we are paying the minimum on each contract. Genesis operates and
maintains these pipelines at its own expense. We have accounted for these agreements as capital leases. The pipelines held under these
capital leases are classified as property and equipment and are amortized using the straight-line
method over the lease terms. Lease amortization is included in depreciation expense. The related
obligations are recorded as debt. At December31, 2005, we had $64million recorded as debt, of
which $574,000 was current. At December31, 2004, we had $46million recorded as debt, of which
$375,000 was current. CO2 Volumetric Production Payments In November2003, we sold 1675 Bcf of CO2 to Genesis for $249million $239
million as adjusted for interim cash flows from the September1, 2003, effective date and for
transaction costs under a volumetric production payment VPP, and assigned to Genesis three of
our existing long-term commercial CO2 supply agreements with our industrial customers.
These industrial contracts represented approximately 60% of our then current industrial
CO2 sales volumes. Pursuant to the VPP, Genesis may take up to 525 MMcf/d of CO2
through 2009, 430 MMcf/d from 2010 through 2012, and 252 MMcf/d to the end of the term. On August26, 2004, we closed on another transaction with Genesis, selling to them a 330 Bcf
volumetric production payment VPPII of CO2 for $48million $46million as
adjusted for interim cash flows from the July 1 effective date and for transaction costs along
with a related long-term supply agreement with an industrial customer. Pursuant to the VPPII,
Genesis may take up to 9 MMcf/d of CO2 to the end of the contract term. In October2005, we sold a third CO2 volumetric production payment VPP III to
Genesis. Under the VPP III, we sold 800 Bcf of CO2 for $147million $144million as
adjusted for interim cash flows from the September 1 effective date and for transaction costs, and
assigned to Genesis two of our existing long-term commercial CO2 supply agreements with
our industrial customers. Pursuant to the VPP III, Genesis may take up to 274 MMcf/d to the end
of the contract term. We have recorded the net proceeds of these volumetric production payment sales as deferred
revenue and will recognize such revenue as CO2 is delivered during the term of the three
volumetric production payments. At December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, $371million, $258million
and $236million, respectively, was recorded as deferred revenue of which $41million, $24
million and $21million was included in current liabilities at December 65 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized deferred revenue of $31million, $24
million and $03million, respectively, for deliveries under these volumetric production payments.
We provide Genesis with certain processing and transportation services in connection with these
agreements for a fee of approximately $017 per Mcf during 2005 and $016 per Mcf during 2004 and
2003, of CO2 delivered to their industrial customers, which resulted in $35million 27million and $04million in revenue to Denbury for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. At December31, 2005 and 2004, we had a net receivable from Genesis of $13
million and $07million, respectively, associated with all of the transactions described above. Summarized financial information of Genesis Energy, L.P.

Note 4. Asset Retirement Obligations On January1, 2003, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. In general, our future asset retirement obligations relate to future
costs associated with plugging and abandonment of our oil and natural gas wells, removal of
equipment and facilities from leased acreage and land restoration. SFAS 143 requires that the
fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in
which it is incurred, discounted to its present value using our credit adjusted risk-free
interest rate, and a corresponding amount capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the
related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted each period, and the capitalized cost is
depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Prior to the adoption of this new
standard, we recognized a provision for our asset retirement obligations each period as part
of our depletion and depreciation calculation, based on the unit-of-production method. The
adoption of SFAS No143 on January1, 2003, required us to record a $26million gain as a
cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle, net of taxes. 66 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Liabilities sold during the 2004 period primarily represent the asset retirement obligations
previously associated with our offshore assets held by Denbury Offshore, Inc., which we sold in
July2004. At December31, 2005 and 2004, $18million and $26million of our asset retirement
obligation was classified in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities under current liabilities
in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have escrow accounts that are legally restricted for
certain of our asset retirement obligations. The balances of these escrow accounts were $67
million at December31, 2005, and $64million at December31, 2004, and are included in Other
assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Note 5. Property and Equipment

At December31, 2005, we had $469million of cost included in CO2 properties and
equipment related to the construction of a CO2 pipeline. These costs were not being
depreciated at December31, 2005, as the pipeline was under construction. Depreciation will
commence when the pipeline is placed into service, which is expected to be in the first quarter of
2006. 67 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Unevaluated Oil and Natural Gas Properties Excluded From Depletion Under full cost accounting, we may exclude certain unevaluated costs from the amortization
base pending determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. A
summary of the unevaluated properties excluded from oil and natural gas properties being amortized
at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the year in which they were incurred follows

Property acquisition costs for 2005 are primarily associated with our acquisition of
acreage in the Barnett Shale area and the acquisition of Lake St. John Field. Costs are
transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the projects are evaluated and proved
reserves established or impairment determined. We review the excluded properties for impairment at
least annually. We currently estimate that evaluation of most of these properties and the
inclusion of their costs in the amortization base is expected to be completed within five years.
Until we are able to determine whether there are any proved reserves attributable to the above
costs, we are not able to assess the future impact on the amortization rate. Note 6. Notes Payable and Long-Term Indebtedness

75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 On December21, 2005, we issued $150million of 75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 2015
Notes. The 2015 Notes were priced at par and we used the $1480million of net proceeds from the
offering to fund a portion of the $248million oil and natural gas property acquisition, which
closed in January2006 see Note 13. Pending the funding of this transaction in January2006, the
net proceeds were used to repay the borrowings 68 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under our bank credit facility with the balance
temporarily invested in short-term investments and included as Cash and cash equivalents in our
December31, 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The 2015 Notes mature on December15, 2015, and interest on the 2015 Notes is payable each
June15 and December15. We may redeem the 2015 Notes at our option beginning December15, 2010,
at the following redemption prices: 10375% after December15, 2010, 1025% after December15,
2011, 10125%, after December15, 2012 and 100% after December15, 2013. In addition, prior to
December15, 2008, we may at our option on one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the 2015 Notes
at a redemption price of 1075% with the net cash proceeds from a stock offering. The indenture
contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends on our common
stock, make investments, create liens on our assets, engage in transactions with our
affiliates, transfer or sell assets, consolidate or merge, or sell substantially all of our
assets. The 2015 Notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. All of our significant
subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee this debt. 75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 On March25, 2003, we issued $225million of 75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013
2013 Notes. The 2013 Notes were priced at 99135% of par and we used most of our $2184
million of net proceeds from the offering, after underwriting and issuance costs, to retire
our then existing $200million of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008, including the Series
B notes see Redemption of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 Including SeriesB Notes
below. The 2013 Notes mature on April1, 2013, and interest on the 2013 Notes is payable each
April 1 and October 1. We may redeem the 2013 Notes at our option beginning April1, 2008, at
the following redemption prices: 10375% after April1, 2008, 1025% after April1, 2009,
10125% after April1, 2010, and 100% after April1, 2011 and thereafter. In addition, prior
to April1, 2006, we may redeem up to 35% of the 2013 Notes at a redemption price of 1075%
with net cash proceeds from a stock offering. The indenture under which the 2013 Notes were
issued is essentially the same as the indenture covering our previously outstanding 9% notes.
The indenture contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, pay
dividends on our common stock, make investments, create liens on our assets, engage in
transactions with our affiliates, transfer or sell assets, consolidate or merge, or sell
substantially all of our assets. The 2013 Notes are not subject to any sinking fund
requirements. All of our significant subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee this
debt. In connection with our internal reorganization to a 
structure see Note 1, we entered into a First Supplemental Indenture dated December29,
2003, which did not require the consent of the holders of the 2013 Notes. The supplemental
indenture made Denbury Resources Inc. and Denbury Onshore, LLC, co-obligors of this debt. All
of our significant subsidiaries continue to fully and unconditionally guarantee this debt.
There were no other significant changes as part of the amendment. Redemption of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 Including SeriesB Notes On April16, 2003, we redeemed our $200million of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 at an
aggregate cost of $2090million, including a $90million call premium. As a result of this early
redemption, we recorded a before-tax charge to earnings in the second quarter of 2003 of $176
million $115million after income tax, which included the $90million call premium and the
write-off of the remaining discount and debt issuance costs associated with these notes. Senior Bank Loan On September1, 2004, we entered into a new bank credit agreement that modified the prior
agreement by icreating a structure wherein the commitment amount and borrowing base amount are
no longer the same, iiimproving our credit pricing by reducing the interest rate chargeable at
certain levels of borrowing, iiiextending the term by three years to April30, 2009, iv
reducing the collateral requirements, vauthorizing up to $20million of possible future
CO2 volumetric production payment transactions with Genesis Energy, and viother minor
modifications and corrections. Under the new agreement, our borrowing base is currently set at
$200million, with an initial commitment amount of $100million. The borrowing base represents the
amount we can borrow from a credit standpoint based on our assets, as confirmed by the banks, while
the commitment amount is the amount we asked the banks to commit to fund pursuant to the terms of
the credit agreement. The banks have the option 69 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to participate in any borrowing request made by us
in excess of the commitment amount, up to the borrowing base limit, although they are not obligated
to fund any amount in excess of $100million, the commitment amount. The advantage to us is that
we will pay commitment fees on the commitment amount, not the borrowing base, thus lowering our
overall cost of available credit. We had two minor amendments to our credit agreement in 2005, and
in January2006, we increased the commitment amount from $100million to $150million to allow
additional availability under our credit line after closing the $248million January2006
acquisition see Note 13. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our producing oil and natural
gas properties and contains several restrictions including, among others: ia prohibition on
the payment of dividends, iia requirement for a minimum equity balance, iiia requirement
to maintain positive working capital, as defined, iv a minimum interest coverage test and va prohibition of most debt and corporate
guarantees. We were in compliance with all of our bank covenants as of December31, 2005.
Our bank credit facility provides for a semiannual redetermination of the borrowing base on
April 1 and October 1. Borrowings under the credit facility are generally in tranches that
can have maturities up to one year. Interest on any borrowings are based on the Prime Rate or
LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin as determined by the borrowings outstanding. The
facility matures in April2009. As of December31, 2005, we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility and $460,000
in letters of credit secured by the facility. The next scheduled redetermination of the
borrowing base will be as of April1, 2006, based on December31, 2005 assets and proved
reserves. Indebtedness Repayment Schedule At December31, 2005, our indebtedness, excluding the discount on our senior subordinated
debt, is repayable over the next five years and thereafter as follows

In conjunction with the sale of Denbury Offshore, Inc. in 2004, we utilized all of our
federal tax net operating loss carryforwards and paid alternative minimum taxes of approximately
$21million. At December31, 2005, we have approximately $246million in state net operating loss
carryforwards that begin to expire in 2013. 70 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements As of December31, 2005, we have an estimated $421
million of enhanced oil recovery credits to carry forward related to our tertiary operations.
These credits will begin to expire in 2020. Deferred income taxes relate to temporary differences based on tax laws and statutory rates in
effect at the December31, 2005 and 2004, balance sheet dates. We believe that we will be able to
utilize all of our deferred tax assets at December31, 2005, and therefore have provided no
valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. At December31, 2005 and 2004, our deferred
tax assets and liabilities were as follows

Note 8. Stockholders Equity Stock Split On October19, 2005, stockholders of Denbury Resources Inc. approved an amendment to our
Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of our authorized common
stock from 100,000,000 shares to 250,000,000 shares and to split our common stock on a 2-for-1
basis. Stockholders of record on October31, 2005, received one additional share of Denbury common
stock for each share of common stock held at that time. Information pertaining to shares and
earnings per share has been retroactively adjusted in the accompanying financial statements and
related notes thereto to reflect the stock split, except for our December31, 2004 balance sheet,
which has not been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. 71 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Authorized We are authorized to issue 250million shares of common stock, par value $001 per share, and
25million shares of preferred stock, par value $001 per share. The preferred shares may be
issued in one or more series with rights and conditions determined by the Board of Directors. Stock Repurchase Plan Between August2003 and June30, 2005, Denbury had an active stock repurchase plan Plan to
purchase shares of our common stock on the NYSE in order for such repurchased shares to be reissued
to our employees who participate in Denburys Employee Stock Purchase Plan see Employee Stock
Purchase Plan below. The Plan provided for purchases through an independent broker of 100,000
shares of Denburys common stock per fiscal quarter over a period of approximately 12months, or a
total of 400,000 shares per year. Purchases were made at prices and times determined at the
discretion of the independent broker, provided however that no purchases were made during the last
10 business days of a fiscal quarter. During 2003, we purchased 200,000 shares at an average cost
of $639 per share and reissued 183,676 of those shares under Denburys Employee Stock Purchase
Plan. In 2004, we repurchased into treasury 400,000 shares at an average cost of $995 per share
and reissued 230,180 treasury shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In the first six
months of 2005, we repurchased into treasury 200,000 shares under the Plan at an average cost of
$1582 per share and reissued 130,831 treasury shares under our ESPP. The repurchase program
expired as of June30, 2005, and the Board of Directors currently does not plan to renew the Plan
until a significant portion of the treasury shares have been used under our ESPP. Stock Incentive Plans Denbury had two stock incentive plans in effect during 2005. The first plan has been in
existence since 1995 the 1995 Plan and expired in August2005. The 1995 Plan only provided for
the issuance of stock options and in January2005, we issued stock options under the 1995 Plan that
utilized substantially all of the remaining shares. The second plan, the 2004 Omnibus Stock and
Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan, has a 10-year term and was approved by the shareholders in May
2004. A total of 50million shares of common stock is authorized for issuance pursuant to the
2004 Plan, of which no more than 2,750,000 shares may be issued in the form of restricted stock or
performance vesting awards. At December31, 2005, a total of 1,644,538 shares were available for
future issuance, of which only 430,000 shares may be in the form of restricted stock or performance
vesting awards. The 2004 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and non-qualified stock
options, restricted share awards and stock appreciation rights settled in stock that may be issued
to officers, employees, directors and consultants. Denbury has historically granted incentive and non-qualified stock options to all of its
employees that generally become exercisable over a four-year vesting period with the specific terms
of vesting determined by the Board of Directors at the time of grant. The options expire over
terms not to exceed 10years from the date of grant, 90days after termination of employment or
permanent disability or one year after the death of the optionee. The options are granted at the
fair market value at the time of grant, which is generally defined in the 1995 Plan as the average
closing price of our common stock for the 10 trading days prior to issuance, or in the case of the
2004 Plan, the closing price on the date of grant. These plans are administered by the
Compensation Committee of Denburys Board of Directors. 72 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Restricted Stock During August2004 through January2005, the Board of Directors, based on a recommendation by
the Boards Compensation Committee, awarded the officers of Denbury a total of 2,200,000 shares of
restricted stock and the independent directors of Denbury a total of 120,000 shares of restricted
stock, all granted under Denburys 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan that was approved by
Denburys shareholders in May2004. The holders of these shares have all of the rights and
privileges of owning the shares including voting rights except that the holders are not entitled
to delivery of the certificates until certain requirements are met. With respect to the 2,200,000 shares of restricted stock granted to officers of Denbury, the vesting restrictions
on those shares are as follows: i 65% of the awards vest 20% per year over five years and, ii
35% of the awards vest upon retirement, as defined in the 2004 Plan. With respect to the 65% of
the awards that vest over five years, on each annual vesting date, 66-2/3% of the vested shares may
be delivered to the holder with the remaining 33-1/3% retained and held in escrow until the
holders separation from the Company. With respect to the 120,000 restricted shares issued to
Denburys independent board members, the shares vest 20% per year over five years. For these
shares, on each annual vesting date, 40% of such vested shares may be delivered to the holder with
the remaining 60% retained and held in escrow until the holders separation from the Company. All
restricted shares vest upon death, disability or a change in control. 73 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Upon issuance of the 2,320,000 shares of restricted stock pursuant to the 2004 Omnibus
Stock and Incentive Plan, we recorded deferred compensation expense of $236million, the market
value of the shares on the grant dates, as a reduction to shareholders equity. This expense will
be amortized over the applicable five-year or retirement date vesting periods. The compensation
expense recorded with respect to the restricted shares for the years ending December31, 2005 and
2004, was $41million and $16million, respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan We have a Stock Purchase Plan that is authorized to issue up to 3,500,000 shares of
common stock to all full-time employees. As of December31, 2005, there are 452,371
authorized shares remaining to be issued under the plan. In accordance with the plan,
employees may contribute up to 10% of their base salary and Denbury matches 75% of their
contribution. The combined funds are used to purchase previously unissued Denbury common
stock or treasury stock purchased by the Company in the open market for that purpose, in
either case, based on the market value of Denburys common stock at the end of each quarter.
We recognize compensation expense for the 75% company match portion, which totaled $12
million, $10million, and $10million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. This plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of Denburys Board of
Directors. 401k Plan Denbury offers a 401k Plan to which employees may contribute tax deferred earnings
subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. Up to 3% of an employees compensation, as
defined by the plan, is matched by Denbury at 100% and an employees contribution between 3%
and 6% of compensation is matched by Denbury at 50%. Denburys match is vested immediately.
During 2005, 2004 and 2003, Denburys matching contributions were approximately $12million 10million, and $11million, respectively, to the 401k Plan. Note 9. Derivative Contracts Effective January1, 2005, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our oil and natural
gas derivative contracts and accordingly de-designated our derivative instruments from hedge
accounting treatment. As a result of this change, we began accounting for our oil and natural gas
derivative contracts as speculative contracts in the first quarter of 2005. As speculative
contracts, the changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in income in the
period of change. Additionally, the balance remaining in Accumulated comprehensive loss at
December31, 2004, related to the derivative contracts was amortized over the remaining life of the
contracts, all of which expired in 2005. We enter into various financial contracts to economically hedge our exposure to commodity
price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We do not hold
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. These contracts have
historically consisted of price floors, collars and fixed price swaps. Historically, we have
generally attempted to hedge between 50% and 75% of our anticipated production each year to
provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover a majority of our budgeted
exploration and development expenditures without incurring significant debt, although our
hedging percentage may vary relative to our debt levels. For 2005 and beyond, we have entered
into fewer derivative contracts, primarily because of our strong financial position resulting
from our lower levels of debt relative to our cash flow from operations. When we make a
significant acquisition, we generally attempt to hedge a large percentage, up to 100%, of the
forecasted production for the subsequent one to three years following the acquisition in order
to help provide us with a minimum return on our investment. All of the mark-to-market
valuations used for our financial derivatives are provided by external sources and are based
on prices that are actively quoted. We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through
established internal control procedures, which are reviewed on an ongoing basis. We attempt
to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring
procedures, and diversification. 74 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

At December31, 2005, our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a
liability of $94million. All of the hedging contracts as of December31, 2005, were put in
place to hedge the estimated proved production from the $248million acquisition which closed in
January2006 see Note13, Subsequent Events. Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies We have operating leases for the rental of equipment, office space, and vehicles that totaled
$372million, $216million, and $166million as of December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively. During the last three years, we entered into lease financing agreements for
equipment at certain of our oil and natural gas properties and CO2 source fields. These
lease financings totaled $173million during 2005, $69million during 2004 and $61million
during 2003 with associated required monthly payments of $223,000 for the 2005 leases, $91,000 for
the 2004 leases and $81,000 for the 2003 leases. All of these leases have seven-year terms. 75 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements In 2004 and 2005, we entered into three agreements with Genesis to transport crude oil
and CO2. These agreements are accounted for as capital leases and are discussed in
detail in Note 3. At December31, 2005, long-term commitments for these items require the following future
minimum rental payments

Long-term contracts require us to deliver CO2 to our industrial CO2
customers at various contracted prices, plus we have a CO2 delivery obligation to
Genesis related to three CO2 volumetric production payments see Note 3. Based upon the
maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the contracts and the volumetric production payments, we
estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to 390 Bcf of CO2 to these customers
over the next 18years, with a maximum volume required in any given year of approximately 113
MMcf/d. However, since the group as a whole has historically purchased less CO2 than
the maximum allowed in their contracts, based on the current level of deliveries, we project that
the amount of CO2 that we will ultimately be required to deliver will be significantly
less than the contractual commitment. Given the size of our proven CO2 reserves at
December31, 2005 approximately 46 Tcf before deducting approximately 2371 Bcf for the VPPs,
our current production capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own
tertiary flooding program, we believe that we can meet these delivery obligations. Denbury is subject to various possible contingencies that arise primarily from interpretation
of federal and state laws and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry. Such
contingencies include differing interpretations as to the prices at which oil and natural gas sales
may be made, the prices at which royalty owners may be paid for production from their leases,
environmental issues and other matters. Although management believes that it has complied with the
various laws and regulations, administrative rulings and interpretations thereof, adjustments could
be required as new interpretations and regulations are issued. In addition, production rates,
marketing and environmental matters are subject to regulation by various federal and state
agencies. Litigation We are involved in various lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings incidental to our
businesses, including those noted below. While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of
these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on
our financial position or overall trends in results of operations or cash flows, litigation is
subject to inherent uncertainties. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the
possibility of a material adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the ruling
occurs. We provide accruals for litigation and claims if we determine that we may have a range of
legal exposure that would require accrual. The estimate of the potential impact from the following
legal proceedings on our financial position or overall results of operations could change in the
future. Along with two other companies, we have been named in a lawsuit styled J. Paulin Duhe,
Inc. vs. Texaco, Inc., et al, Cause No101,227, filed in late 2003 in the 16th
Judicial District Court, Division E, Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, seeking restoration to its
original condition of property on which oil has been produced over the past 70years. The
contract and tort claims by the plaintiffs allege surface and groundwater damage of 26 acres
that are part of our Iberia Field in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. Recently, plaintiffs experts
have initially alleged that clean-up of alleged contamination of the property would cost $790
million, although settlement offers by plaintiffs have already been made for much smaller sums.
The property was originally 76 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements leased to Texaco, Inc. for mineral development in 1934 and Denbury acquired its interest
in the property in August2000 from Manti Operating Company. During 2005, the courts ruled
that the plaintiffs claims were premature in insofar as they sought to enforce the end of
lease restoration obligation. Other claims were not dismissed and certain aspects of the
litigation are ongoing. We believe that we are indemnified by the prior owner, which we expect
to cover our exposure to most damages, if any, found to have occurred prior to the time that we
purchased the property. We believe that the allegations of this lawsuit are subject to a
number of defenses, are without merit and we and the other defendants plan to vigorously defend
this lawsuit, and if necessary, we will seek indemnification from the prior owner. On December29, 2003, an action styled Harry Bourg Corporation vs. Exxon Mobil
Corporation, et al, Cause No140749, was filed in the 32nd Judicial District Court, Terrebonne Parish,
Louisiana against Denbury and 11 other oil companies and their predecessors alleging damage as
the result of mineral exploration activities conducted by these oil and gas operators/companies
over the last 60years. Plaintiff has asked for restoration of the 10,000-acre property and/or
damages in claims made under tort law and various oil and gas contracts. The Bourg Corporation
produced preliminary expert reports that allege damages of approximately $1000million against
the defendants as a group. Discovery is continuing in this case, with trial currently set for
June2006. Depending on the outcome of the case, we may have indemnification obligations to
prior owners. We believe we have historical documents and matters of fact which we believe
provide strong defenses against these claims and we plan to vigorously defend this lawsuit
along with the other defendants. Note 11. Supplemental Information Significant Oil and Natural Gas Purchasers Oil and natural gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis or under short-term contracts at the
current area market price. The loss of any purchaser would not be expected to have a material
adverse effect upon our operations. For the year ended December31, 2005, three purchasers each
accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC
28%, Hunt Crude Oil Supply Co. 20% and Sunoco, Inc. 13%. For the year ended December31,
2004, we had two significant purchasers that each accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural
gas revenues: Hunt Crude Oil Supply Co. 21% and Genesis 14%. For the year ended December31,
2003, two purchasers each accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Hunt Crude
Oil Supply Co. 15% and Genesis 12%. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities

values of our short-term investments are discussed in Note 1. We have other financial instruments
consisting primarily of cash, cash equivalents, short-term receivables and payables that
approximate fair value due to the nature of the instrument and the relatively short maturities. Note 12. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information On December29, 2003, we amended the indenture for our 75% Senior Subordinated Notes due
2013 to reflect our new holding company organizational structure see Note 1 and Note 6. As
part of this restructuring our indenture was amended so that both Denbury Resources Inc. and
Denbury Onshore, LLC became co-obligors of our subordinated debt. Prior to this restructure,
Denbury Resources Inc. was the sole obligor. Our subordinated debt is fully and
unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by all of Denbury Resources Inc.s
subsidiaries other than minor subsidiaries. The results of our equity interest in Genesis is
reflected through the equity method by one of our subsidiaries, Denbury Gathering Marketing.
Each subsidiary guarantor and the subsidiary co-obligor are 100% owned, directly or
indirectly, by Denbury Resources Inc. The following is condensed consolidating financial

Note 13. Subsequent Events. On January31, 2006, we completed an acquisition of three producing oil properties that are
future potential CO2 tertiary oil flood candidates: Tinsley Field approximately 40
miles northwest of Jackson, Mississippi; Citronelle Field in Southwest Alabama, and the smaller
South Cypress Creek Field near the Companys Eucutta Field in Eastern Mississippi. We expect to
begin our initial tertiary development work at Tinsley Field during 2006 with more significant work
during 2007. The timing of tertiary development at Citronelle Field is uncertain as we will need
to build a 60- to 70-mile pipeline extension of our line to East Mississippi before flooding can
commence, and South Cypress Creek will probably be flooded following our initial development of our
other East Mississippi properties. 81 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The adjusted purchase price is approximately $248million, after adjusting for interim
net cash flow and minor purchase price adjustments. The acquisition was funded with the proceeds
of $150million of senior subordinated notes issued in December2005 and bank financing under the
Companys existing credit facility. On January11, 2006, we increased the commitment on our bank credit line from $100million to
$150million to allow additional availability under our credit line after closing the $248million
January2006 acquisition discussed above. Note 14. Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures unaudited Costs Incurred The following table summarizes costs incurred and capitalized in oil and natural gas property
acquisition, exploration and development activities. Property acquisition costs are those costs
incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire property, including both undeveloped leasehold
and the purchase of reserves in place. Exploration costs include costs of identifying areas that
may warrant examination and examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects
containing oil and natural gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells, geological
and geophysical costs and carrying costs on undeveloped properties. Development costs are incurred
to obtain access to proved reserves, including the cost of drilling development wells, and to
provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and natural gas. Costs incurred in oil and natural gas activities were as follows

Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Net proved oil and natural gas reserve estimates for all years presented were prepared by
DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas. The
reserves were prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and, accordingly, were based on existing economic and operating
conditions. Oil and natural gas prices in effect as of the reserve report date were used
without any escalation. See Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and
Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves below for a discussion of the
effect of the different prices on reserve quantities and values. Operating costs,
production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs were based on current costs with
no escalation. We have a corporate policy whereby we do not book proved undeveloped reserves until we
have committed to perform the required development operations, the majority of which we
generally expect to commence within one to two years. We also have a corporate policy whereby
proved undeveloped reserves must be economic at prices significantly lower than the year-end
prices used in our reserve report; i.e., at prices closer to historical averages. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved
reserves and in projecting the future rates of production and timing of development
expenditures. The following reserve data represents estimates only and should not be
construed as being exact. Moreover, the present values should not be construed as the current
market value of our oil and natural gas reserves or the costs that would be incurred to obtain
equivalent reserves. All of our reserves are located in the United States. 83 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Improved recovery additions result from the application of secondary recovery methods such
as water-flooding or tertiary recovery methods such as CO2 flooding. Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating to
Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves The Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating
to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Standardized Measure does not purport to present the
fair market value of our oil and natural gas properties. An estimate of such value should
consider, among other factors, anticipated future prices of oil and natural gas, the
probability of recoveries in excess of existing proved reserves, the value of probable
reserves and acreage prospects, and perhaps different discount rates. It should be noted
that estimates of reserve quantities, especially from new discoveries, are inherently
imprecise and subject to substantial revision. Under the Standardized Measure, future cash inflows were estimated by applying year-end
prices to the estimated future production of year-end proved reserves. The product prices
used in calculating these reserves have varied widely during the three-year period. These
prices have a significant impact on both the quantities and value of the proven reserves as
the reduced oil price causes wells to reach the end of their economic life much sooner and can
make certain proved undeveloped locations uneconomical, both of which reduce the reserves.
The following representative oil and natural gas year-end prices were used in the Standardized
Measure. These prices were adjusted by field to arrive at the appropriate corporate net
price.

Future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future production, development and
abandonment costs based on year-end costs to determine pre-tax cash inflows. Future income
taxes were computed by applying the statutory tax rate to the excess of pre-tax cash inflows
over our tax basis in the associated proved oil and natural gas properties. Tax credits and
net operating loss carryforwards were also considered in the future income tax
calculation. Future net cash inflows after income taxes were discounted using a 10%
annual discount rate to arrive at the Standardized Measure. 84 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.

Improved recovery additions result from the application of secondary recovery methods such
as water flooding or tertiary recovery methods such as CO2 flooding. CO2 Reserves Based on engineering reports prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our CO2
reserves, on a 100% working interest basis, were estimated at approximately 46 Tcf at
December31, 2005 includes 2371 Bcf of reserves dedicated to three volumetric production
payments with Genesis, 27 Tcf at December31, 2004 includes 1787 Bcf of reserves dedicated
to two volumetric production payments, and 16 Tcf at December31, 2003 includes 1626 Bcf
of reserves dedicated to a volumetric production payment. We make reference to the gross
amount of proved reserves as that is the amount that is available both for Denburys tertiary
recovery programs and for industrial users who are customers of Denbury and others, as we are
responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream for both of these
purposes. 85 Table of Contents Denbury Resources Inc.
