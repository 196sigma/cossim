ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Shareholders of
Network Appliance, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Network
Appliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of April 30, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended April 30, 2000. Our audits also included the consolidated financial
statement schedule listed in Item 14a2. These financial statements and the
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and the
financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Network Appliance,
Inc. and its subsidiaries as of April 30, 2000 and 1999, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended April 30, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the consolidated
financial statement schedule listed in Item 14a2, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLAR AND SHARE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE DATA
1. THE COMPANY
Network Appliance, Inc., incorporated in the state of California in April
1992, and its subsidiaries operate in a single industry segment and are involved
in the design, manufacturing, marketing and support of high performance network
attached data storage and access devices which provide fast, simple, reliable
and cost-effective file service and content delivery solutions for
data-intensive network environments.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Fiscal Year -- We operate on a 52-week or 53-week year ending on the last
Friday in April. For presentation purposes we have indicated in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements that our fiscal year end is April 30. Fiscal
2000 was a 52-week fiscal year. Fiscal 1999 was a 53-week fiscal year and fiscal
1998 was a 52-week year.
Basis of Presentation -- The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts
and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts from prior
years have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation. These
reclassifications did not change previously reported total assets, liabilities,
shareholders' equity or net income.
Cash and Cash Equivalents -- We consider all highly liquid debt investments
with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-term Investments -- Our short-term investments consist of debt and
equity securities with original maturities ranging between three and twelve
months. All of our investments are classified as available-for-sale, which are
measured at market value, and net unrealized gains or losses are recorded in
cumulative other comprehensive loss, a separate component of shareholders'
equity, until realized. Any gains or losses on sales of investments are computed
based upon specific identification. For all periods presented, realized gains
and losses on available-for-sale investments were not significant. Management
determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the
time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date.
Inventories -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in,
first-out basis or market.
Property and Equipment -- Property and equipment are stated at cost and
depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives which range
from two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their
estimated useful lives or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Revenue Recognition -- In accordance with Statement of Position SOP
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, we recognize revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, collectibility is probable and
vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee
to any undelivered elements of the arrangement. This generally occurs at the
time of shipment, at which time we also record estimated product return and
warranty reserves. Revenues from software subscriptions, which entitle customers
to software updates, including bug fixes, patch releases and major revisions,
and services are recognized over the terms of the related contractual periods
and were less than 10% of net sales in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998.
Advertising Costs -- Advertising costs are charged to operations when
incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 were approximately
$2,594, $1,072 and $1,000, respectively.
Software Development Costs -- We capitalize eligible computer software
development costs, which include software enhancement costs, upon the
establishment of technological feasibility, which occur upon the completion of a
working model. Software development costs capitalized have not been significant.

NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DOLLAR AND SHARE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE DATA
Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Exchange Contracts -- Prior to
fiscal 1999, the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries was the U.S.
dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and liabilities were translated at the
current exchange rate at the end of the year, nonmonetary assets and liabilities
were translated at historical rates and net sales and expenses were translated
at average exchange rates in effect during the period. Transaction gains and
losses, which are included in other income expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income, have not been significant.
In fiscal 1999, we determined that the functional currencies of certain of
our foreign subsidiaries had changed from the U.S. dollar to the local
currencies. Accordingly, for fiscal 2000 and 1999, assets and liabilities of our
foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in
effect as of the balance sheet date, and results of operations for each
subsidiary are translated using average rates in effect for the period
presented. Translation adjustments have been included within shareholders'
equity as part of cumulative other comprehensive loss. The effect of the change
in functional currencies did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which are included in the
consolidated statements of income, have not been material in any of the three
years presented. We utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge against the
short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets or
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The gains or losses on these
contracts are included in income as the exchange rates change. Management
believes that these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to
foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts are
offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and transactions being
hedged.
Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties -- The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
We are subject to certain risks, including without limitation, risks
relating to fluctuating operating results, customer and market acceptance of new
products, dependence on new products, rapid technological change, litigation,
dependence on growth in the network attached data storage market, expansion of
international operations, product concentration, changing product mix,
competition, management of expanding operations, dependence on high-quality
components, dependence on proprietary technology, intellectual property rights,
dependence on key personnel, volatility of stock price, shares eligible for
future sale, and effect of certain anti-takeover provisions and dilution.
Concentration of Credit Risk -- Financial instruments which potentially
subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of municipal
securities, cash accounts held at various banks and a money market fund held at
several financial institutions. We sell our products primarily to large
organizations in different industries and geographies. Credit risk is further
mitigated by our credit evaluation process and limited payment terms. We do not
require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. In
addition, we maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses. In entering into
forward foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise
from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
contracts. The counterparties to these contracts are major multinational
commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of counterparty
defaults.
Comprehensive Income -- During fiscal 1999, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS
130, which requires an enterprise to report, by major components and as a
single total, the change in net assets during the period from nonowner sources.

DOLLAR AND SHARE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE DATA
Comprehensive income for the years ended April 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 has been
disclosed within the consolidated statements of shareholders' equity and
comprehensive income. Total comprehensive income was equal to net income for the
year ended April 30, 1998.
Net Income Per Share -- Basic net income per share is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for that
period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive
potential shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential
common shares consist of incremental common shares subject to repurchase and
common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options. All prior-period net
income per-share amounts have been restated to reflect the two-for-one stock
splits which were effective December 20, 1999 and March 22, 2000 See Note 6.
The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the
basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented                              YEARS ENDED APRIL 30,

Stock-Based Compensation -- We account for stock-based awards to employees
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Accounting for Long-Lived Assets -- We evaluate the impairment of
long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to
those assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards -- In June 1998, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, which defines derivatives, requires that all derivatives be carried
at fair value, and provides for hedging accounting when certain conditions are
met. This statement, as amended, is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000. Although we have not fully assessed the
implications of this new statement, we do not believe adoption of this statement
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

4. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In fiscal 2000, we executed agreements to acquire approximately 377 acres
of land in Sunnyvale, California. These sites will support expansion of
approximately 800,000 square feet to accommodate future growth. In fiscal 1999,
we executed agreements to acquire approximately 18 acres of land in Sunnyvale,
California and to develop 393,000 square feet of buildings. Beginning in June
1999, we began relocating all of our principal activities to Sunnyvale. This new
headquarter site will consolidate general administration, sales and marketing,
research and development, customer services and manufacturing operations. Our
manufacturing and research and development facilities will begin to relocate in
the first quarter of fiscal 2001 and will be complete in the second quarter of
fiscal 2001. The Santa Clara facilities are leased under various operating
leases with 100,000 square feet of space expiring in June 2000, and the
remaining 20,000 square feet expiring in fiscal 2003. We lease other sales
offices and a design center throughout the United States and internationally.
These sales offices are also leased under operating leases which expire through
fiscal 2013. We are responsible for certain maintenance costs, taxes and
insurance under these leases.
In fiscal 2000, we executed two lease agreements to acquire approximately
377 acres of land in Sunnyvale, California and the accompanying 533,262 square
feet of buildings. We subsequently assigned our rights and obligations under all
the agreements for the Sunnyvale facilities to a third-party entity and entered
into two operating leases. Our lease payments will vary based on LIBOR plus a
spread 80% at April 30, 2000. The leases are for five years and can be
renewed for two five-year periods, subject to the approval of the third-party
entity. At the expiration or termination of the leases, we have the option to
either purchase these properties for $55,000 and $62,000, respectively, or
arrange for the sale of the properties to a third party for at least $55,000 and
$62,000, respectively, with a contingent liability for any deficiency. If the
properties under these leases are not purchased or sold as described above, we
will be obligated for additional lease payments of approximately $49,288 and
$51,460, respectively.
In fiscal 1999, we executed three lease agreements to acquire approximately
18 acres of land in Sunnyvale, California and to develop 393,000 square feet of
buildings. We subsequently assigned our rights and obligations under all the
agreements for the Sunnyvale facilities to a third-party entity and entered into
three operating leases. The leases require monthly payments, which vary, based
on the LIBOR plus a spread. The aggregate annual minimum rent commitment under
one lease, which began in August 1999, is approximately $3,520. The lease
payments under the other two operating leases are expected to commence in the
first and second quarter of fiscal 2001 and will also vary based on LIBOR plus a
spread, estimated to be approximately $3,840 and $2,880. Our lease payments
under these three leases are included in the minimum annual lease payments
schedule below. The leases are for five years and can be renewed for two
five-year periods, subject to the approval of the third-party entity. At the
expiration or termination of the leases, we have the option to either purchase
these properties for $44,000, $48,000 and $36,000, respectively, or arrange for
the sale of the properties to a third party for at least $44,000, $48,000 and
$36,000, respectively, with a contingent liability for any deficiency. If the
properties under these leases are not purchased or sold as described above, we
will be obligated for additional lease payments of approximately $36,960 43,912 and $32,610, respectively.
The operating leases mentioned above require us to maintain specified
financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of April 30, 2000.

leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The
difference between the amounts paid and the amounts expensed is classified as
long-term obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
We are also subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either
asserted or unasserted, which arise in the normal course of business. We do not
believe that any current litigation claims will have a material adverse effect
on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
5. LINE OF CREDIT
In July 1998, we negotiated a $5,000 unsecured revolving credit facility
with a domestic commercial bank. Under terms of the credit facility, which
expires in July 2000, we must maintain various financial covenants. Any
borrowings under this agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus 1% or at the
lender prime lending rate, such rate determined at our discretion.
We also have foreign exchange facilities used for hedging arrangements with
several banks that allow us to enter into foreign exchange contracts of up to
$65,000, of which $10,395 was available at April 30, 2000.
6. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Follow-on Public Offering -- In March 1999, we completed a public offering
of 11,500 shares of our common stock and received net proceeds of $138,834.
Stock Splits -- On December 20, 1999 and March 22, 2000, the Company
effected two-for-one stock splits of the outstanding shares of common stock. All
share and per share amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been
adjusted to give effect to the stock split.
Preferred Stock -- Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
5,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without
any further vote or action by the shareholders.
Stock Option Plans -- We adopted the 1993 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan
the 1993 Plan in April 1993. In September 1995, we adopted the 1995 Stock
Incentive Plan the 1995 Plan. The 1995 Plan replaced the 1993 Plan, and
provides for the grant of options and the issuance of common stock under terms
substantially the same as those provided under the 1993 Plan, except that the
1995 Plan does not allow for the exercise of options prior to vesting.
Accordingly, all options and shares issued under the 1993 Plan were incorporated
into the 1995 Plan upon the effectiveness of our initial public offering.
Under the 1995 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to employees,
directors and consultants options to purchase shares of our common stock. The
exercise price for an incentive stock option and a nonqualified
33

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DOLLAR AND SHARE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE DATA
stock option cannot be less than 100% and 85%, respectively, of the fair market
value of our common stock as determined by the Board of Directors on the date of
grant. Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally vest at a rate of 25% on
the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and then ratably over the
following 36 months. Options expire as determined by the Board of Directors, but
not more than ten years after the date of grant.
In April 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the Special Non-Officer Stock
Option Plan the Non-Officer Plan which provides for the grant of options and
the issuance of common stock under terms substantially the same as those
provided under the 1995 Plan, except that the Non-Officer Plan allows only for
the issuance of nonqualified options to non-officer employees.
In August 1999, the Board of Directors adopted the 1999 Stock Option Plan
the 1999 Plan which is comprised of two separate equity incentive programs:
i the Discretionary Option Grant Program under which options may be granted to
eligible individuals during the service period at a fixed price per share and
ii Automatic Option Grant Program under which non-employee Board members will
automatically receive special option grants at designated intervals over their
period of Board service.
The 1999 Plan will supplement the existing 1995 Plan and Non-Officer Plan
and those plans will continue to remain in full force and effect until all
available shares have been issued under each such plan. However, the Automatic
Option Grant Program previously in effect under the 1995 Plan terminated as of
October 26, 1999 and all automatic option grants made to non-employee Board
members on or after that date will be made under the 1999 Plan.
Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to employees,
directors and consultants and other independent advisors options to purchase
shares of our common stock during their period of service with us. The exercise
price for an incentive stock option and a non-statutory option cannot be less
than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date.
Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first
anniversary of the vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following
36 months. Options will have a term of ten years after the date of grant,
subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events.
Options granted under the 1999 Plan are subject to the cancellation/regrant
program with the following limitations: i only options held by employees who
are neither executive officers nor members of the Board can be repriced; and
ii the total number of repriced options will not exceed ten percent of the
total number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 1999
Plan. No options have been repriced under the 1999 Plan.

1,473 and 1,092 shares were issued in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively, at a
weighted average price of $387 and $280, respectively.
Pro Forma Information -- As discussed in Note 2, we continue to account for
our stock-based awards using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related
interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized in the
financial statements for employee stock arrangements with the exception of
$1,345, $667 and $270 in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, which
consists of the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the
granting of nonqualified stock options at exercise prices below market.
In fiscal 1999, we recorded $230 compensation expense for the fair value of
options granted to an independent contractor.
SFAS 123 requires the disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per
share had we adopted the fair value method as of the beginning of fiscal 1996.
Under SFAS 123, the fair value of stock-awards to employees is calculated
through the use of option pricing models, even though such models were developed
to estimate the fair value of freely tradeable, fully transferable options
without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ from our stock option
awards. These models also require subjective assumptions, including future stock
price volatility and expected time to exercise, which greatly affect the
calculated values. Our calculations were made using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions                                YEARS ENDED APRIL 30,

65%   50%   50%
Expected   --    --       Our calculations are based on a multiple option valuation approach and
forfeitures are recognized as they occur. If the computed fair values of the
awards issued beginning in fiscal 1996 had been amortized to expense over the
vesting period of the awards, pro forma net income and net income per share
would have been as follows                               YEARS ENDED APRIL 30,

Net income per share,   001    004   003   However, the impact of outstanding non-vested stock options granted prior
to fiscal 1996 has been excluded from the pro forma calculations; accordingly,
the fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 pro forma adjustments are not indicative of
future period pro forma adjustments, when the calculation will apply to all
applicable stock options.
Deferred Stock Compensation -- In May 1995, we issued stock options for the
purchase of 8,504 shares of common stock at $002 per share. We recognized $515
of deferred compensation in May 1995 equal to the difference between the option
price as determined by the Board of Directors and $008 the deemed fair value
for financial reporting purposes for each option. We are amortizing the
deferred compensation expense ratably over the four-year period in which the
options vest.

We recorded $1,845, $916 and $714 of deferred compensation in fiscal 2000,

certain highly compensated employees. Under terms of the 1995 Stock Option Plan,
highly compensated employees as defined by our management are eligible to
contribute between $15 to $75 in annual salary for the rights to be granted
nonqualified stock options. The discount from fair market value which is equal
to the amount of salary contributed has been recorded as deferred compensation
expense. We are amortizing the deferred compensation expense ratably over a

The following disclosures are made in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures About Fair
Value of Financial Instruments SFAS 107, which requires the disclosure of
fair value information about both on- and off-balance sheet financial
instruments where it is practicable to estimate the value. Fair value is defined
in SFAS 107 as the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
