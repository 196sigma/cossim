Class   2002  Barker, Persinger, Doyle Committees of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors has three committees each composed solely of two of
our independent directors, Messrs. Barker and Sullivan. The committees and
their function are as follows. The audit committee is charged with reviewing our annual audit and
meeting with our independent accountants to review our internal controls
and financial management practices. The compensation committee is responsible for establishing salaries,
bonuses and other compensation for our executive officers. The option committee has the authority to determine the terms and
conditions of each option to be issued under our stock option plans and
the responsibility for administration of each such plan.
In addition, the Company also maintains an executive operating committee
comprised of seven executive officers. The executive operating committee has
the authority to make specific recommendations and render advice to the board
of directors on various matters regarding operations. The eight members
include the President, Chief Executive Officer and all of our Executive and
Senior Vice Presidents.
Director Compensation
Messrs. Barker and Sullivan, two of our three independent directors, each
receives an annual fee of $30,000 for serving on our board of directors. In
addition, our directors are reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, in connection with their travel to and attendance at meetings of our
board of directors or its committees. On October 19, 1999, we granted 50,000
stock options to Mr. Barker at an exercise price of $769 per share, which was

Section 16a Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16a of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive
officers, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, to file with
the Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in
ownership of our common stock and other equity securities. Such persons are
required by the Commission regulations to furnish us with copies of all
Section 16a reports they file. Prior to our initial public offering, our
directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of our common
stock were not subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act.
Based solely upon a review of the copies of such reports or written
representations that no other reports were required, we believe that during
the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 our executive officers, directors and
greater than 10% beneficial owners complied with all applicable Section 16a
filing requirements, except for the following                    37. Stephen D. Fenstermacher, Donald W. Herndon, Gwendolyn J. Pennington,
Terry L. Persinger, Eileen M. Vennum and Brad G. Wayment, all of whom
are our executive officers did not timely file their initial report on
Form 3. Steven A. Barker, Ph.D., one of our directors and Jeffrey P. Bourgoyne,
Stephen D. Fenstermacher and Eileen M. Vennum, all of whom are our
executive officers did not timely file Form 4 required as a result of
being granted stock options. Mr. William C. Fioretti, 10% beneficial owner of our common stock, did
not timely file Form 4 on seven different occasions relating to the
sale of his shares. Peter E. Hammer, one of our executive officers, did not timely file a
Form 4 on two occasions relating to sale of his shares. Donald W. Herndon, executive officer, did not timely report on a Form 4
on two occasions relating to the sale of his shares.
We have begun to send monthly reporting reminders to each of our executive
officers and 10% beneficial owners to assist in their Section 16a reporting
requirements.
