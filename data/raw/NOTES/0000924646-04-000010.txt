To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity, and of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MPS
Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company  management;  our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include deposits in banks, government securities,
money market funds, and short-term investments with maturities, when acquired,
of 90 days or less.
Furniture, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements
Furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation of furniture and
equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets. The Company has developed a proprietary software package
which allows the Company to implement imaging, time capture, and data-warehouse
reporting. The costs associated with the development of this proprietary
software package have been capitalized, and are being amortized over a five-year
period. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards 'SFAS'
No. 144, 'Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,' as of
January 1, 2002. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its carrying value
of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Carrying value write-downs and
gains and losses on disposition of property and equipment are reflected in
'Income from operations. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board 'FASB' issued SFAS
No. 142, 'Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,' which was required to be
adopted for fiscal 2002. SFAS No. 142 established accounting and reporting
standards for goodwill and  intangible  assets  resulting  from business
combinations. In connection with SFAS No. 142, the Company is required to
perform goodwill impairment reviews, at least annually, utilizing a fair-value
approach. Additionally, SFAS No. 142 required a transitional goodwill impairment
review upon adoption.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2002. In connection
therewith, the Company engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist
with the required transitional goodwill impairment review. As of December 31,
2001, the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected goodwill of $1,1660
million. After performing the required transitional goodwill impairment tests,
the Company recognized a loss of $5537 million, net of an income tax benefit of
$1130 million, and recorded the loss net of the related tax benefit as a
cumulative effect of an accounting change in the Company Consolidated
Statement of Operations for 2002. The Company performed additional valuation
testing during the fourth quarter of 2002 and 2003 the Company designated
timing of the annual impairment test under SFAS No. 142 and did not incur any
further impairment. The Company plans to perform its next annual impairment
review during the fourth quarter of 2004. An impairment review prior to the
Company next scheduled annual review may be required if certain events occur,
including lower than forecasted earnings levels for various reporting units. In
addition, changes to other assumptions could significantly impact our estimate
of the fair value of our reporting units. Such a change may result in a goodwill
impairment charge, which could have a significant impact on the reportable
segments that include the related reporting units and the Company Consolidated
Financial Statements.
As part of the Company goodwill impairment reviews, fair value was
calculated using an equally blended value of a discounted cash flow analysis and
market comparables. In contrast to SFAS 142, the prior accounting standard SFAS
No. 121 required the use of undiscounted cash flow estimates over the remaining
useful life of the goodwill and other long-lived assets as a step 1 test for
possible impairment. Under SFAS No. 121, the concept of recoverability of the
goodwill over the useful life of the asset was the underlying test for
impairment as opposed to fair value under SFAS No. 142. This fundamental
difference in the underlying methodologies of testing for impairment of goodwill
in SFAS No. 121 and SFAS No. 142 caused the Company to attribute the resulting
impairment from the initial valuation completed on January 1, 2002 to a change
in accounting principle upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Projected cash flows,
used for both SFAS No. 121 and No. 142 testing, considered the effects from the
then downturn in the Company business.
As mentioned above, the Company used an equally blended value of a
discounted cash flow analysis and market comparables to arrive at fair value for
SFAS No. 142. For the discounted cash flow analysis, significant assumptions
included expected future revenue growth rates, reporting unit profit margins,
working capital levels and a discount rate. The revenue growth rates and
reporting unit profit margins are based, in part, on the Company expectation
of an improving economic environment. Market comparables included a comparison
of the market ratios and performance fundamentals from comparable companies. The
use of these measurement criteria is consistent with the underlying concepts
used in determining the fair value of a company or reportable unit under the
market approach. The market ratios the Company used refer to the multiples of
revenue and earnings of comparable companies and the performance fundamentals
refer to the consideration of the effects of the differences in the operating
metrics, ie. growth rates, operating margins, gross margins, etc. on the value
of the company versus the comparable companies. See Note 5 to the Company
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
In 2002 and 2003, the Company acquired a health care staffing business and
two legal staffing businesses, respectively. These acquisition were recorded in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141 'Business Combinations'. See Note
3 and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes substantially all revenue at the time services are
provided and is recorded on a time and materials basis. In most cases, the
consultant is the Company employee and all costs of employing the worker are
the responsibility of the Company and are included in cost of revenue. Revenues
generated when the Company permanently places an individual with a client are
recorded at the time of placement less a reserve for employees not expected to
meet the probationary period.
In addition and to a lesser extent, the Company is involved in fixed price
or lump-sum engagements. The services rendered by the Company under the relevant
contracts generally require performance spanning more than one accounting
period.  The Company recognizes revenue for these engagements under the
proportional performance accounting model.
Foreign Operations
The financial position and operating results of foreign operations are
consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency. These
operating results are considered to be permanently  invested in foreign
operations. Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of
exchange to the U.S. dollar on the balance sheet date, and the local currency
revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange to the U.S.
dollar during the period.
Stock-Based Compensation
During December 2002, the FASB, issued SFAS No. 148, 'Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure,' which provides for
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair-value-based
method of accounting for stock-based compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148
amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, 'Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,' to require more prominent disclosure in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.
The Company accounts for its employee and director stock option plans in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, 'Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related Interpretations. The Company measures compensation expense for
employee and director stock options as the aggregate difference between the
market value of its common stock and exercise prices of the options on the date
that both the number of shares the grantee is entitled to receive and the
exercise prices are known. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock
grants is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant and is
recorded pro rata over the required holding period. If the Company had elected
to recognize compensation cost for all outstanding options granted by the
Company, by applying the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 148 to
stock-based employee compensation, net loss income and loss earnings per
share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below. dollar amounts in thousands except per share amounts               2003      2002      2001

The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS
Nos. 133, 137, and 138 related to Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities 'SFAS No. 133, as amended'. The Company adoption of SFAS
No. 133, as amended, in the first quarter of 2001 did not have an initial impact
on the Company as the Company did not hold any derivatives prior to 2001. In
2001, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage and
reduce the risk inherent in interest rate fluctuations. The Company entered into
these agreements to convert certain floating rate debt outstanding under the
Company credit facility into fixed rate debt by fixing the base rate, as
defined by the credit facility. These derivatives were classified as cash flow
hedges as interest rate swap agreements are considered hedges of specific
borrowings. Differences received under the swap agreements were recognized as
adjustments to interest expense. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these
hedges were recorded in 'Accumulated other comprehensive loss' on the balance
sheet. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were no interest rate swap
agreements outstanding.
Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset
or liability measured at their fair value. If the derivative is designated as a
fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the
derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of
'Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income loss' and recognized in the
'Consolidated statements of operations' when the hedged item affects earnings.
Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of hedges are recognized in
earnings.
Hedging interest rate exposure through the use of swaps were specifically
contemplated to manage risk in keeping with management policy. The Company does
not  utilize  derivatives  for  speculative  purposes.  These swaps were
transaction-specific so that a specific debt instrument determined the amount,
maturity and specifics of each swap.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is based on income before taxes as reported
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis
of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to reverse. An assessment is made as to
whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets.
This assessment includes anticipating future taxable income.
The Company is subject to periodic review by federal, state, foreign and
local taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business. During 2001, the
Company was notified by the Internal Revenue Service that certain prior year
income tax returns would be examined. As part of this examination, the Company
recorded a tax provision of $87 million in 2002 for an agreed upon adjustment
with the Internal Revenue Service. For a further discussion, see Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net Income Loss per Common Share
The consolidated financial statements include 'basic' and 'diluted' per
share information. Basic per share information is calculated by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted per share
information is calculated by also considering the impact of potential common
stock on both net income and the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
The weighted average number of shares used in the basic earnings per share
computations were 1017 million, 1008 million, and 979 million in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. The only difference in the computation of basic and
diluted earnings per share is the inclusion of 28 million and 310,000 potential
common shares in 2003 and 2001, respectively. As the Company was in loss
position for 2002 from continuing operations, before the cumulative effect of an
accounting change, the potential common shares for 2002 were excluded from the
calculation of diluted earnings per share as the shares would have had an
anti-dilutive effect. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Excess Real Estate Obligations
The Company recorded a $90 million charge in 2002, of which $284,000 was
recaptured in 2003,  relating to its abandonment of excess real estate
obligations for certain vacant office space.
For the Company discontinued Manchester operations, the Company recorded
$732,000 of contract termination costs in 2002. As a result of the sale of
Manchester, the Company recorded an additional $705,000 of contract termination
costs in 2003, which is included in 'Loss on Disposition, net of tax' on the
Company Consolidated Statement of Operations.
These charges recapture were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized, at fair value, when the liability is incurred rather
than at the time an entity commits to a plan. See Note 17 and Note 18 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Discontinued Operations
In December 2003, the Company sold certain operating assets and transferred
certain operating liabilities of its outplacement unit, Manchester, for $80
million in cash while retaining the working capital of the business of
approximately $20 million. The initial after-tax loss on the sale was $207
million. The Company recorded the disposition in accordance with SFAS no. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. See Note 18 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Impairment of Investment
The Company had a minority investment in a privately held company that was
recorded as a non-current asset. The asset was carried at its original cost plus
accrued interest. The investment was originally made in 1996 and was set to
mature in 2004. In 2002, this privately held company recapitalized at terms
which diluted the value of the Company investment. The Company elected not to
participate in the recapitalization, which resulted in the investment being
impaired. As a result, the Company wrote off the investment in its entirety
recognizing a $162 million charge in 2002.
The process of assessing whether a particular equity investment net
realizable value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of
judgment. The Company periodically monitors an investment for impairment by
considering, among other things, the investee cash position, projected cash
flows, financing needs, liquidation preference, most recent valuation data
including the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost,
the current investing environment, competition and the Company intent and
ability to hold the investment.
Pervasiveness of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Although management believes these estimates and assumptions are
adequate, actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts have been reclassified in 2001 and 2002 to conform to the
2003 presentation. 3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
In February and August of 2003, the Company acquired the legal staffing
businesses of LawPros and LawCorps, respectively. Purchase consideration totaled
$160 million in cash, of which $153 million was at closing. In July 2002, the
Company acquired a health care staffing business, Elite Medical subsequently
re-branded as Soliant Health. Purchase consideration totaled $159 million 72 million in cash, and 11 million shares of MPS Common Stock valued at $87
million. The Company did not make any acquisitions in 2001.
The Company, in the past, has been obligated under certain acquisition
agreements to make earn-out payments to former stockholders of certain acquired
companies,  accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, upon
attainment of certain earnings targets of the acquired companies. The Company
recorded these payments as goodwill in accordance with EITF 95-8, 'Accounting
for Contingent Consideration Paid to the Shareholders of an Acquired Enterprise
in a Purchase Business Combination'. The Company has not made any material
earn-out payments in 2001, 2002 or 2003. 4. INDEBTEDNESS

The Company had a revolving credit facility that expired in October 2003,
with no borrowings outstanding. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company
closed on a $150 million revolving credit facility syndicated to a group of
leading financial institutions. The credit facility contains certain financial
and non-financial covenants relating to the Company operations, including
maintaining certain financial ratios. Repayment, if applicable, of the credit
facility is guaranteed by substantially of the subsidiaries of the Company. The
facility expires in November 2006. The Company incurred certain costs directly
related to obtaining the credit facility in the amount of approximately $10
million. These costs have been capitalized and are being amortized over the life
of the credit facility, and are included in the line item 'Other assets, net' on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2003, there are no borrowings
outstanding under this facility. 5. GOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

$16 million and $466,000, respectively, of identifiable intangible assets on
the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to the Company acquisitions
in 2002 and 2003. Identifiable intangible assets relate to both the existing
value of the target customer relationships at the date of the acquisition and
trade names, if applicable. See Note 3 to the Company Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of the Company acquisitions.

recorded in 2002.
Litigation
The Company is a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of
the ordinary conduct of its business. In the opinion of management, based on the
advice of in-house and external legal counsel, the lawsuits and claims pending
are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial
position, its results of operations, or its cash flows. 7. INCOME TAXES

Net deferred tax asset                             $ 64,664   $   70,948
Recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management belief that it
is more likely than not that the tax benefit associated with temporary
differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will be utilized. A
valuation allowance is recorded for those deferred tax assets for which it is
more likely than not that realization will not occur.
The Company valuation allowance at December 31, 2003, consisted of $147
million in foreign tax credit carryforwards, $88 million in state net operating
loss carryforwards, and $37 million for a capital loss carryforward. The
valuation allowance at December 31, 2002, consisted of $140 million in foreign
tax credit  carryforwards,  $73  million in state net  operating  loss
carryforwards, and $37 million for a capital loss carryforward.
The Company generated a federal net operating loss carryforward in 2003
resulting in a deferred tax asset of $161 million. This federal net operating
loss carryforward will expire in 2024.
The Company has a net deferred tax asset in 2002 resulting primarily from
its tax basis in deductible goodwill being greater than the associated financial
statement carrying amount. The Company recognized an impairment loss recorded as
a change in accounting principle associated with the Company adoption of SFAS
No. 142. This impairment reduced the financial statement carrying amount of
goodwill. The Company tax basis in its tax deductible goodwill will be
deducted in the Company income tax returns, generating $4200 million of
future tax deductions over the next 15 years.
The Company is subject to periodic review by federal, foreign, state and
local taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business. During 2001, the
Company was notified by the Internal Revenue Service that certain prior year
income tax returns would be examined. As part of this examination, the Company
recorded a tax provision of $87 million in 2002 for an agreed upon adjustment
with the Internal Revenue Service. This Internal Revenue Service examination
will be finalized once it has been reviewed by the Joint Committee on Taxation. 8. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Profit Sharing Plans
The Company has a qualified contributory 401k profit sharing plan which
covers all full-time employees over age twenty-one with over 90 days of
employment and 375 hours of service. The Company made matching contributions of
approximately $21 million and $71 million, net of forfeitures, to the profit
sharing plan for 2003 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, management elected
not to match employee deferrals. When the Company reinstated the match for the
2003 plan year, it redefined the terms to match at least 25% of employee
contributions up to the first 5% of total eligible compensation, as defined in
the various profit sharing plans. For 2003, the Company matched 40%.
The Company has assumed many 401k plans of acquired subsidiaries. From
time to time, the Company merges these plans into the Company plan. Company
contributions relating to these merged plans are included in the aforementioned
total. Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company also has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for its
highly compensated employees. While the deferred compensation plan provides for
matching contributions, management elected not to match employee deferrals for
2003, 2002 and 2001. The Company looks to invest the assets of the deferred
compensation plan based on investment allocations of the employees. The
liability to the employees for amounts deferred is included in 'Other' in the
Liabilities section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Effective the beginning of 2002, the Company purchased insurance on the
lives of its highly compensated employees. This company-owned life insurance is
utilized to settle the Company obligations of deferred compensation. The
policies are issued by Mutual of New York 'MONY'. The Company has directed
MONY to invest the assets consistent with the investment allocations of the
employees. The cash surrender value of the company-owned life insurance is
included in 'Other assets, net' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Stock Repurchase Plan
The Company Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to
$650 million of the Company Common Stock. Beginning in the third quarter of
2002 through the second quarter of 2003, 16 million shares at a cost of $91
million have been repurchased under this authorization. There has been no
activity under this authorization since the second quarter of 2003.
Incentive Employee Stock Plan
The Company employee stock option plan Employee Plan provides for the
granting of options for the purchase of the Company common stock to key
employees. The Employee Plan, among other things, requires the exercise price of
non-qualified stock options to not be less than 100% of the fair market value of
the stock on the date the option is granted, and defines a director to comply
with Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and with
Section 162m of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. There were no
material amendments to the Employee Plan from 2001 to 2003.
Additionally, the Company assumed the stock option plans of some its
subsidiaries upon acquisition in accordance with terms of the respective merger
agreements. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the assumed plans had an
immaterial number of options outstanding.
In 2001, the Company adopted the 2001 Voluntary Stock Option Exchange Plan
the 'Option Exchange Plan' in an effort to improve the retention and incentive
aspects of the Company Employee Plan, and to provide a mechanism to return
shares to the Employee Plan for future issuance. The Option Exchange Plan
allowed eligible option holders, as defined, to voluntarily cancel existing
options in exchange for new options to be issued no earlier than six months and
one day following termination of existing options. The exercise price of the new
options was the market price on the date of re-issuance. Vested options that
were cancelled were re-granted on a one-for-one basis and were completely vested
upon re-grant. Unvested options that were cancelled were re-granted on a
one-for-two basis and will vest in equal annual installments over a three year
period from the date of re-grant.
The Option Exchange Plan was approved by the Compensation Committee and the
non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The Company completed the Option
Exchange Plan in the third quarter of 2001 with the re-grant of 82 million
options. The Company did not incur any compensation charges in connection with
the Option Exchange Plan. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan
The Company director stock option plan Director Plan provided for the
granting of options for the purchase of the Company common stock to
non-employee directors. The Director Plan expired of its own term December 2003.
The Director Plan allowed each non-employee director to purchase 60,000 shares
at an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of the grant
upon election to the Board. In addition, the Director Plan provided for an
annual issuance of non-qualified options to purchase 20,000 shares to each
director, upon reelection, at an exercise price equal to the fair market value
at the date of grant. The Board of Directors were also able to grant additional
options to non-employee directors from time to time as the Board determined in
its discretion. The Committee has not issued non-qualified options at an
exercise price less than 100% of the fair market value and, therefore, the
Company has not been required to recognize compensation expense for its stock
option plans. The options become exercisable ratably over a three-year period
and expire ten years from the date of the grant. However, the options are
exercisable for a maximum of three years after the individual ceases to be a
director and, if the director ceases to be a director within one year of
appointment, the options are cancelled. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company
granted 260,000, 180,000 and 490,000 options, respectively, at an average
exercise price of $782, $631 and $388, respectively.

11. RELATED PARTY
During 2001, the Company President and Chief Executive Officer issued the
Company a promissory note for $15 million, bearing interest at 47%. Under the
conditions of the note, if employment terms were met over 2001 and 2002, the
unpaid principal and accrued interest would be forgiven. Accordingly, $785,300
million of unpaid principal and accrued interest was forgiven and recorded as
compensation expense in the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations in
both 2002 and 2001. 12. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company
places its cash and cash equivalents with what management believes to be high
credit quality institutions. At times such investments may be in excess of the
FDIC insurance limit. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of
its customers and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable
credit risk exposure is limited. 13. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and notes payable to former
target shareholders approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of
these assets and liabilities. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility
have variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for
similar debt. The carrying amount of this debt is considered by management to be
a reasonable estimate of its fair value. 14. FURNITURE, EQUIPMENT, AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

The Company discloses segment information in accordance with SFAS No. 131 Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,' which
requires companies to report selected segment information on a quarterly basis
and to report certain entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major
customers, and the material countries in which the entity holds assets and
reports revenues.
The Company has three reportable segments: professional services, IT
services, and IT solutions. The Company reportable segments are strategic
divisions that offer different services and are managed separately as each
division requires different resources and marketing strategies. The professional
services division provides expertise in a wide variety of disciplines including
accounting and finance, law, engineering, health care, and executive search. The
IT services division offers value-added solutions such as IT project support and
staffing, recruitment of full-time positions, project-based solutions, supplier
management solutions, and on-site recruiting support. The IT solutions division
provides IT strategy consulting, design and branding, application development,
and integration. The professional services division results for 2003, include
the results of the Company health care staffing unit, which was acquired by
the Company in July 2002, and the results from the acquisitions of two legal
staffing businesses, which were acquired in February and August of 2003. The
Company evaluates segment performance based on revenues, gross profit, and
income before provision for income taxes. The Company does not allocate income
taxes, interest or unusual items to the segments.
The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 and all intersegment
sales and transfers are eliminated.
No one customer represents more than 5% of the Company overall revenue.
Therefore, the Company does not believe it has a material reliance on any one
customer as the Company is able to provide services to numerous Fortune 1000 and
other leading businesses.

investment, and 2 90 million exit costs. 2003 includes a $284,000
recapture relating to the settlement of abandoned real estate associated
with the 2002 exit costs. 17.  Excess Real Estate Obligations
In 2001 and 2002, the Company experienced a material decrease in demand for
its domestic operations. To reflect this decreased demand, the Company made
attempts to realign its real estate capacity needs by vacating and reorganizing
certain office space.
In 2002, management determined that the Company would not be able to
utilize this vacated office space and, therefore, notified the respective
lessors of their intentions. This determination eliminated the economic benefit
associated with the vacated office space. As a result, the Company recorded a
charge for contract termination costs, mainly due to, costs that will continue
to be incurred under the lease contract for its remaining term without economic
benefit to the Company. While the Company looks to settle excess lease
obligations, the current economic environment has made it difficult for the
Company to either settle or find acceptable subleasing opportunities. The
average remaining lease term for the lease obligations included herein is
approximately 15 years.
The following table summarizes the activity of the charge for contract
termination costs from origination through December 31, 2003 by reportable

18.  Discontinued Operations
In December 2003, the Company sold certain operating assets and transferred
certain operating liabilities of its outplacement unit, Manchester. Revenue
generated from Manchester was $210 million, $358 million, and $479 million,
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Income before taxes was a $37 million
loss, $22 million of income, and $97 million of income, for 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The major classes of assets and liabilities as of December
31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows, with the remaining net assets of $109,000 at

Included in the 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities' line item above
are amounts for exit costs associated with abandoned real estate. At December
31, 2003 and 2002, there was $11 million and $732,000 of contract termination
costs, respectively. 19.  Equity Investment
The Company had a minority investment in a privately held company that was
recorded as a non-current asset. The asset was carried at its original cost plus
accrued interest. The investment was originally made in 1996 and was set to
mature in 2004. In 2002, this privately held company recapitalized at terms
which diluted the value of the Company investment. The Company elected not to
participate in the recapitalization, which resulted in the investment being
impaired. As a result, the Company wrote off the investment in its entirety
recognizing a $162 million charge in 2002.
The process of assessing whether a particular equity investment net
realizable value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of
judgment. The Company periodically monitors the investment for impairment by
considering, among other things, the investee cash position, projected cash
flows, financing needs, liquidation preference, most recent valuation data
including the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost,
the current investing environment, competition, and the Company intent and
ability to hold the investment.
