REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders 
National HealthCare Corporation
Murfreesboro, Tennessee
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National HealthCare Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders= equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company=s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of National HealthCare Corporation and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the Company=s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated March 16, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ BDO Seidman, LLP

Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National HealthCare Corporation and its subsidiaries ANHC@ or the ACompany@. All material intercompany balances, profits, and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, and minority interests are reflected in consolidation. Investments in entities in which we lack control but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for on the equity method. Investments in entities in which we lack the ability to exercise significant influence are included in the consolidated financial statements at the lower of the cost or fair value of our investment.
Generally, we operate, manage or provide services to long-term health care centers and associated assisted living centers, retirement centers and home health care programs located in Southeastern, Midwestern and Western states in the United States. The long-term health care environment has continually undergone changes with regard to Federal and state reimbursement programs and other payor sources, compliance regulations, competition among other health care providers and patient care litigation issues. We continually monitor these industry developments as well as other factors that affect our business. 
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Net Patient Revenues Gross patient revenues are recorded on an accrual basis based on services rendered at amounts equal to our established rates. Approximately 72% of our net patient revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004 are from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
Our patient revenues are derived primarily from skilled, intermediate and rehabilitative nursing services offered in long-term health care centers or in a patient=s home. In some locations, we offer associated retirement center services and/or assisted living center services. Our goal is to offer a continuum of care, with patients passing from a retirement center or home care to assisted living or long-term nursing center care as their needs change.
We receive payments from the Medicare program under a prospective payment system APPS@. Under this PPS, for long-term care services, Medicare pays a fixed fee per Medicare patient per day, based on the acuity level of the patient, to cover all post-hospital extended care routine service costs, ancillary costs and capital related costs. Amounts received from Medicaid programs are generally based on fixed rates subject to program cost ceilings.
For homecare services, Medicare pays based on the acuity level of the patient and based on episodes of care. An episode of care is defined as a length of care up to 60 days with multiple continuous episodes allowed. The services covered by the episode payment include all disciplines of care, in addition to medical supplies, within the scope of the home health benefit. We are allowed to make a request for anticipated payment at the start of care equal to 60% of the expected payment for the initial episode. The remaining balance due is paid following the submission of the final claim at the end of the episode. Revenues are recognized when services are provided based on the number of days of service rendered in the episode. Deferred revenue is recorded for payments received for which the related services have not yet been provided. 56 Allowances for contractual adjustments are recorded for the differences between our established rates and amounts paid by the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other third party payors. Contractual adjustments are deducted from gross patient revenues to determine net patient revenues. 
All amounts earned under the Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs are subject to review by the payors. In the opinion of management, adequate provision and reserves have been made for any adjustments that may result from such reviews, including reviews related to the transition of payments to the PPS amounts. Any differences between estimated settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized. NHC recorded $3,090,000 of net unfavorable settlements in 2006, and $169,000 in 2005, and $24,225,000 in 2004 of net favorable settlements from Medicare and Medicaid.
With respect to our long-term health care centers, for the cost report years 1997 and 1998 which were subject to a retrospective reimbursement methodology, we submitted various requests for exceptions to Medicare routine cost limitations for reimbursement. During 2001, we received preliminary approval on substantially all of our exception requests, which approvals total approximately $14,186,000. We have in addition made provisions of approximately $12,761,000 for various Medicare and Medicaid issues for current and prior years. We recognize revenues associated with the approved exception requests and provisions when the approvals are assured and the results of final cost report audits are known. These approvals and audit results are subject to further audit and review by the fiscal intermediaries for a three-year period. As such, the approved requests and cost report provisions have been included in amounts due to third party payors, wh
ich are payables to Medicare and Medicaid intermediaries, in the consolidated balance sheets. The three-year review period expired in 2004 for approximately $22,820,000 of routine cost limit exceptions and provisions. Therefore, these exceptions and provisions have been eliminated from the amounts due to third party payors and have been recorded as revenues in 2004. The amounts recorded during 2006 and 2005 were not significant. 
Other Revenues As discussed in Note 5, other revenues include revenues from the provision of insurance, management and accounting services to other long-term care providers, guarantee fees, advisory fees from National Health Realty, Inc. ANHR@, dividends and other realized gains on marketable securities, equity in earnings of unconsolidated investments, interest income, rental income, loss on disposal of assets and other income. Our insurance revenues are generally paid in advance and then amortized into income as earned over the related policy period. We charge for management and accounting services based on a percentage of net revenues or based on a fixed fee per bed of the long-term care center under contract. Advisory fees are based on our contractual agreements with NHR and, through October 31, 2004, National Health Investors, Inc. and are discussed in Notes 2 and 3. We 
generally record other revenues on the accrual basis based on the terms of our contractual arrangements. However, with respect to management and accounting services revenue and interest income from certain long-term care providers, including but not limited to National Health Corporation ANational@ and NHI, as discussed in Note 5, where collection is not reasonably assured based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections, our policy is to recognize income only in the period in which collection is assured and the amounts at question are believed by management to be fixed and determined. 
Certain management contracts, including contracts with National and NHI, subordinate the payment of management fees earned under those contracts to other expenditures of the long-term care center and to the availability of cash provided by the facility=s operations. Revenues from management services provided to the facilities that generate insufficient cash flow to pay the management fee, as prioritized under the contractual arrangement, are not recognized until such time as the amount of revenue earned is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. This recognition policy has caused our reported revenues and net income from management services to vary significantly from period to period. 57 We use the equity method of accounting for our investments in and earnings or losses of affiliates that we do not control but over which we exert significant influence. We consider whether the fair values of any of our equity method investments have declined below their carrying value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable. If we considered any such decline to be other than temporary, a write-down would be recorded to estimate fair value. 
Provision for Doubtful Accounts The Company=s allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated using current agings of accounts receivable, historical collections data and other factors. Management reviews these factors and determines the estimated provision for doubtful accounts. Historical bad debts have generally resulted from uncollectible private balances, some uncollectible coinsurance and deductibles and other factors. Receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible are written off. The allowance for doubtful accounts balance is assessed on a quarterly basis, with changes in estimated losses being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period identified. 
The Company includes provisions for doubtful accounts in operating expenses in its consolidated statements of operations. The provisions for doubtful accounts were $27,000, $2,641,000, and $2,175,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
Property and Equipment We use the straight-line method of depreciation over the expected useful lives of property and equipment estimated as follows: buildings and improvements, 20-40 years and equipment and furniture, 3-15 years. The provision for depreciation includes the amortization of properties under capital leases.
Leasehold improvements attached to properties owned by NHI and NHR are depreciated over periods that do not exceed the non-cancelable respective lease terms using the straight-line method.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged against income as incurred. Betterments are capitalized. We remove the costs and related allowances from the accounts for properties sold or retired, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income. We include interest costs incurred during construction periods in the cost of buildings $370,000 in 2006, $31,000 in 2005, and $240,000 in 2004.
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, AAccounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets@ ASFAS 144@, we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property by property basis. We review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances, including significant physical changes in the property, significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property, indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable. The need to recognize an impairment is based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property. If recognition of an impairment is necessary, 
it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
Mortgage and Other Notes Receivable In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, AAccounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 15@ ASFAS 114@, NHC evaluates the carrying values of its mortgage and other notes receivable on an instrument by instrument basis. On a quarterly basis, NHC reviews its notes receivable for recoverability when events or circumstances, including the non-receipt of contractual principal and interest payments, significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions, indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable. If necessary, an impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash 
flows expected to be received under the note receivable or, if foreclosure is probable, the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable.
Investments in Marketable Securities Our investments in marketable securities include available for sale securities, which are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded in stockholders= equity in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, AAccounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities@ ASFAS 115@. 
Goodwill The Company accounts for goodwill under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, AGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets@ ASFAS 142@. Under the provisions of the statement, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment tests based on their estimated fair value. Unamortized goodwill is continually reviewed for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142.
Other Assets Deferred financing costs are amortized principally by the effective interest method over the terms of the related debt obligations. 
Income Taxes We utilize Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, AAccounting for Income Taxes@, which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. See Note 11 for further discussion of our accounting for income taxes.
Concentration of Credit Risks Our credit risks primarily relate to cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash held by trustees, accounts receivable, marketable securities and notes receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in bank accounts and overnight investments. Restricted cash is primarily invested in commercial paper and certificates of deposit with financial institutions and other interest bearing accounts. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from patients funded approximately 87% through Medicare, Medicaid, and other contractual programs and approximately 13% through private payors and from other health care companies for management, accounting and other services. We perform continual credit evaluations of our clients and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts on these accounts receivable. Marketable securities are held primarily in accounts with brokerage institutions. Notes receivable relate primarily to secured loan
s with health care facilities recorded as notes receivable in the consolidated balance sheets as discussed in Note 9. We also have notes receivable from National and the National Health Corporation Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan AESOP@ as discussed in Note 4.
Our financial instruments, principally our notes receivable, are subject to the possibility of loss of the carrying values as a result of either the failure of other parties to perform according to their contractual obligations or changes in market prices which may make the instruments less valuable. We obtain various collateral and other protective rights, and continually monitor these rights in order to reduce such possibilities of loss. We evaluate the need to provide reserves for potential losses on our financial instruments based on management periodic review of the portfolio on an instrument by instrument basis. See Notes 4 and 9 for additional information on the notes receivable.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months when purchased.
Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily represents cash that is held by trustees and cash that is held for the purpose of our workers compensation insurance and professional liability insurance.
Inventories Inventories consist generally of food and supplies and are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
Other Current Liabilities Other current liabilities primarily represent accruals for current federal and state income taxes, real estate taxes, debt service rent and other current liabilities.
Accrued Risk Reserves We are principally self-insured for risks related to employee health insurance, workers= compensation and professional and general liability claims. Accrued risk reserves primarily represent the accrual for self-insured risks associated with employee health insurance, workers= compensation and professional and general liability claims. The accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims. Our policy with respect to a significant portion of our workers= compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to support the estimates recorded for incurred but unreported claims. Our health insurance reserve is based on our known claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis of historical claims
paid. We reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis, with changes in estimated losses being recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period identified.
Stock-Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123revised 2004, AShare-Based Payment@ ASFAS 123R@, using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this method, compensation cost is recognized, beginning January 1, 2006, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date, and based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, AAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation ASFAS 123@, for all awards granted to employees prior to January 1, 2006 that remain unvested on the effective date. Prior to January 1, 2006, we applied Accounting Principles Boa
rd Opinion No. 25, AAccounting for Stock Issued to Employees@ AAPB 25@ and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock benefit plans. We adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123 and accordingly, prior to January 1, 2006, no compensation cost was recognized for stock options granted under the plans because the exercise prices for options granted were equal to the quoted market prices on the option grant dates and all option grants were to employees or directors. Results for prior periods have not been restated for the adoption of SFAS 123R. See Note 12 for additional disclosures about our stock option plan. 58 For periods prior to adoption of SFAS 123R, SFAS 123 required us to determine pro forma net income and earnings per share as if compensation cost for our employee stock option and stock purchase plans had been determined based upon fair values at the grant date. These pro forma amounts for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows 2005

$ 191 Deferred Lease Credit-- 
Deferred lease credits include amounts being amortized to properly reflect expenses on a straight line basis under the terms of our existing lease agreements. 
Other Noncurrent Liabilities Other noncurrent liabilities include reserves related to various income tax and other contingencies.
With respect to guarantee obligations in place prior to January 1, 2003, we account for our obligations under guarantee agreements in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Accounting Standards No. 5, AAccounting for Contingencies@ ASFAS 5. For guarantee obligations assumed subsequent to January 1, 2003, consistent with the provisions of Interpretation No. 45, AGuarantor=s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others@ AFIN 45, at the inception of a guarantee agreement, we recognize a liability for the estimated fair value of the obligation assumed. 
We account for our contingent liabilities for income tax matters in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 5. Contingent liabilities for income tax matters include amounts for income taxes, applicable penalties, and interest thereon and are the result of the potential alternative interpretations of tax laws and the judgmental nature of the timing of recognition of taxable income. 
Deferred Revenue-- 
Deferred revenue includes the deferred gain on the sale of assets to National as discussed in Note 4, certain amounts related to episodic payments received by our home health care providers in advance of providing services as discussed in Note 1 and entrance fees that have been and are currently being received upon reservation and occupancy of retirement center units for a continuing care retirement community we own. In accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants= Audit and Accounting Guide, AHealth Care Organizations,@ the entrance fees have been recorded as deferred revenue. The refundable portion 90% of the entrance fees is being recognized over the life of the facility while the non-refundable portion 10% is being recognized over the remaining life expectancies of the residents. 59 Comprehensive Income-- 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, AReporting Comprehensive Income@ requires that changes in the amounts of certain items, including gains and losses on certain securities, be shown in the consolidated financial statements as comprehensive income. We report our comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of stockholders= equity.
Segment Disclosures Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, ADisclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information@ establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual and interim financial reports issued to stockholders. Management believes that substantially all of our operations are part of the long-term health care industry segment. Our operations outside of the long-term health care industry segment are not material. See Note 5 for a detail of other revenues provided within the long-term health care industry segment. Information about the costs and expenses associated with each of the components of other revenues is not separately identifiable. 
New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board AFASB@ issued FASB Statement No. 154, Accounting for Changes and Error Corrections. This new standard replaces APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. Statement 154 requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. Statement 154 also provides that 1 a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long-lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle, and 2 correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a Arestatement@. We have adopted the new standard effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning January 1, 2006. Adoption of this pronouncement has not had a significant impact on the Company=s consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments - an amendment to FASB Statements No. 133 and 144 FAS 155. FAS 155 simplifies the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments containing embedded derivatives. FAS 155 allows fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation under FAS 133. In addition, it amends FAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. The Company will adopt the provisions of FAS 155 beginning in fiscal 2007. The implementation of FAS 155 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.
In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. This Statement clarifies when servicing rights should be separately accounted for, requires companies to account for separately recognized servicing rights initially at fair value, and gives companies the option of subsequently accounting for those servicing rights at either fair value or under the amortization method. SFAS 156 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The implementation of FAS 156 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 60 In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 will require that the financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts, but without considering time values. FIN 48 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our financial statements. Upon adoption, the cumulative effect of applying the provision of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustmen
t to the opening balance of retained earnings for 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting the provisions of FIN 48 is expected increase the opening balance of retained earnings in 2007.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, AFair Value Measurements@. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. The new FASB rule does not supersede all applications of fair value in other pronouncements, but creates a fair value hierarchy and prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques for use in most pronouncements. It requires companies to assess the significance of an input to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Statement 157 also requires companies to disclose information to enable users of financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop the fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2007. The implementation of FAS 157 is not expected to have material impact on the Company<
FONT FACE=WP TypographicSymbols>=s consolidated financial statements. 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, AEmployers= Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - An amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R@. This Statement enhances disclosure regarding the funded status of an employers= defined benefit postretirement plan by a requiring companies to include the funding status in comprehensive income and b recognize transactions and events that affect the funded status in the financial statements in the year in which they occur c at the measurement date of the employer=s fiscal year-end. SFAS 158 is effective in two phases for publicly traded employers: 1 recognition of the funded status and relate disclosures, for the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2
006; 2 measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer=s fiscal year-end for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company has no defined benefit plans. The implementation of phase 1 of FAS 158 has not had a material impact on the Company=s consolidated financial statements. Implementation of phase 2 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company=s consolidated financial statements. 
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, AThe Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115@. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 115, AAccounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities@, with respect to accounting for a transfer to the trading category for all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities electing the fair value option. This statement allows companies to elect fair value accounting for many financial instruments and other items that currently are not required to be accounted as such, allows different applications for electing the option for a single item or groups of items, and requires disclosures to facilitate comparisons of similar assets and liabilities that are acc
ounted for differently in relation to the fair value option. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The implementation of FAS 159 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company=s consolidated financial statements. Note 2 - Relationship with National Health Realty, Inc.
Proposed Merger Agreement Between NHC and NHR See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about a proposed merger agreement between NHC and NHR. 
In 1997, we formed NHR as a wholly-owned subsidiary. We then transferred to NHR certain healthcare facilities then owned by NHC and distributed the shares of NHR to NHC=s shareholders. The distribution had the effect of separating NHC and NHR into two independent public companies. As a result of the distribution, all of the outstanding shares of NHR were distributed to the then NHC investors. NHR is listed on the American Stock Exchange. 
Leases Effective August 1, 2005, we elected to exercise our option to extend the term of our leases of properties from National Health Realty, Inc. ANHR@ for two additional five year terms until December 31, 2017. The leases are for the real estate of ten long-term care centers, three assisted living centers and one retirement center. The currently running initial term of the leases expires on December 31, 2007. The leases were further amended to grant us an option to renew the leases at fair market value for a second extended term of ten years until December 31, 2027, assuming no defaults. We account for the leases as operating leases.
Under the terms of the master lease, we continue to guarantee to NHR the lease payments of six Florida long-term care facilities and three assisted living centers, as discussed below. This requirement is unchanged from our original lease as amended.
The lease payments for the extended ten-year term of the leases that begin on January 1, 2008 are the same lease payments that were required in the initial term of the lease, including an annual inflator for percentage rent as described below. The lease payments for the second extended ten-year term that begins on January 1, 2018, if renewed, will be at fair market value as determined at the time of the lease renewal.
During the remaining initial term and the extended renewal term, we are obligated to pay NHR annual base rent on all 23 of the facilities of $15,960,000. In addition to base rent, in each year after 1999, we are obligated to pay percentage rent to NHR equal to 3% of the amount by which gross revenues of each NHR leased health care facility in such later year exceed the gross revenues of such health care facility in the base year of 1999. Percentage rent for 2006, 2005, and 2004, was approximately $1,972,000, $1,363,000, and $1,295,000, respectively. Each lease with NHR is a Atriple net lease@ under which we are responsible for paying all taxes, utilities, insurance premium costs, repairs and other charges relating to the operation of the facilities. We are obligated at our expense to maintain adequate insurance on the facilities= assets. 
On October 1, 2000, we terminated our individual leases on nine Florida long term care facilities. However, we remain obligated under our master lease agreement to make the lease payments to NHR on the nine Florida long term care facilities. Also effective October 1, 2000, the facilities were leased by NHR under a five year term to nine separate limited liability corporations, none of which we own or control. The leases have currently been extended through December 31, 2010. Lease payments to NHR from the new lessees offset our lease obligations pursuant to the master operating lease. Since October 1, 2000, the nine separate limited liability corporations have made all required lease payments to NHR, and we have not been required to make any lease payments with respect to those nine properties. 
We have a right of first refusal with NHR to purchase any of the properties transferred from us should NHR receive an offer from an unrelated party during the term of the lease or up to 180 days after termination of the related lease.
At December 31, 2006, the approximate future minimum base rent commitments to be paid by us on non-cancelable operating leases are as follows Total Commitments

Revenues produced within the addition shall be excluded from any percentage rent calculation. At such time as we are no longer a tenant by virtue of lease terminations then NHR shall purchase the additional beds paid for by us but un-reimbursed by NHR for the lesser of 1 the appraised value of the addition or 2 the construction cost incurred by us plus 50% of any appraised value increase over cost. In addition, we agree at NHR=s request to finance NHR=s purchase of the addition with a floating rate interest only note at the prime rate of interest for a period of up to two years. We have previously submitt
ed a listing of six NHR owned properties expected to be expanded by us for which the construction cost is expected to total approximately $30,586,000. Of this amount, $20,811,000 of additions have been placed in service as of December 31, 2006.
Advisory Agreement-- 
We have entered into an Advisory Agreement with NHR whereby services related to investment activities and day-to-day management and operations are provided to NHR by NHC as Advisor. The Advisor is subject to the supervision of and policies established by NHR=s Board of Directors. The Advisory Agreement expired December 31, 2003 and thereafter is renewed automatically from year to year unless earlier terminated. Either party may terminate the Advisory Agreement at any time on 90 days written notice. The Advisory Agreement may be terminated for cause at any time.
On August 1, 2005, concurrent with the lease extensions described above, the Advisory Agreement was amended to provide that beginning for the year 2005 for our services under the Advisory Agreement, we are entitled to annual compensation equal to the greater of 1 25% of NHR=s gross consolidated revenues or 2 $500,000. It was also clarified that NHR and not NHC is to bear all of its own corporate costs. 
Prior to the August 1, 2005 amendment, the Advisory Agreement had provided that for our services under the Advisory Agreement, we were entitled to annual compensation of the greater of 2% of our gross consolidated revenues or the actual expenses incurred by us. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, advisory fees earned under the Advisory Agreement was $524,000, $508,000, and $411,000, respectively.
Investment in NHR Common Stock At December 31, 2006, we own 345,200 shares or 35% of NHR=s outstanding common stock. We account for our investment in NHR common stock as available for sale marketable securities in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 115. Note 3 - Relationship with National Health Investors, Inc.
In 1991, we formed NHI as a wholly-owned subsidiary. We then transferred to NHI certain healthcare facilities owned by NHC and distributed the shares of NHI to NHC shareholders. The distribution had the effect of separating NHC and NHI into two independent public companies. As a result of the distribution, all of the outstanding shares of NHI were distributed to the then NHC investors. NHI is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Leases On December 27, 2005, under an agreement to the master lease, we exercised our option to extend the existing master lease on 41 properties for the second renewal term. The 41 properties include four Florida properties that are leased to and operated by others, but for which we continue to guarantee the lease payments to NHI under the master lease. The 15-year lease extension begins January 1, 2007, and includes three additional five-year renewal options, each at fair market value. Under the terms of the lease, base rent for 2007 will total $33,700,000 with rent thereafter escalating by 4% of the increase in facility revenue over a 2007 base year. The lease was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2006 unless extended by us. The terms of the existing lease remain in place for 2006, as discussed below. 
On October 17, 1991, concurrent with our conveyance of real property to NHI, we leased from NHI the real property of 40 long-term health care centers and three retirement centers. Each lease is for an initial term originally expiring December 31, 2001, with two additional five-year renewal terms at our option, assuming no defaults. During 2000, we exercised our option to extend the lease term for the first five-year renewal term under the same terms and conditions as the initial term. We account for the leases as operating leases.
During the initial term and first renewal term of the leases, we were obligated to pay NHI annual base rent on all 43 facilities of $19,355,000 as adjusted for new construction since inception. 
The leases also obligate us to pay as debt service rent all payments of interest and principal due under each mortgage to which the conveyance of the facilities was subject. The payments are required over the remaining life of the mortgages as of the conveyance date, but only during the term of the lease. Payments for debt service rent are being treated by us as payments of principal and interest if we remain obligated on the debt Aobligated debt service rent@ and as operating expense payments if we have been relieved of the debt obligation by the lender Anon-obligated debt service rent@. See AAccounting Treatment of the Transfer@ for further discussion.
In addition to base rent and debt service rent, we were required to pay percentage rent to NHI equal to 3% of the increase in the gross revenues of each facility. The percentage rent is based on a quarterly calculation of revenue increases and is payable on a quarterly basis. Percentage rent for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was approximately $4,829,000, $4,525,000, and $4,124,000, respectively.
Each lease with NHI is a Atriple net lease@ under which we are responsible for paying all taxes, utilities, insurance premium costs, repairs and other charges relating to the ownership of the facilities. We are obligated at our expense to maintain adequate insurance on the facilities' assets.
We have a right of first refusal with NHI to purchase any of the properties transferred from us should NHI receive an offer from an unrelated party during the term of the lease or up to 180 days after termination of the related lease.
As the result of a fire in a building leased from NHI by one of our limited liability company subsidiaries, the lease was terminated during the third quarter of 2004. A provision of the lease allowed that if substantial damage occurred during the lease term, we could terminate the lease with respect to the damaged property. Under the lease, NHC will have no obligation to repair the property and NHI will receive the entire insurance proceeds related to the building damage. We are obligated to continue to indemnify and hold harmless NHI from any and all demands arising from our use of the property. NHI retains the right to license the beds under the lease termination.
On April 1, 2004, we terminated, with NHI=s approval, our individual lease on an 80 bed long-term health care center located in Dawson Springs, Kentucky. 
On October 1, 2000, we terminated our individual leases with NHI on four Florida long-term health care facilities. However, we remain obligated to NHI under our master lease agreement and continue to remain obligated to make the lease payments to NHI. Subsequently, the facilities were immediately leased by NHI for a five year term to four separate corporations, none of which we own or control. Lease payments received by NHI from the new lessees offset our lease obligations pursuant to the master operating lease. These leases have currently been extended through December 31, 2010. Through December 31, 2006, all such lease payments have been received by NHI and offset against our obligations. 62 Base rent expense to NHI was $19,355,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Non-obligated debt service rent to NHI was $8,014,000 in 2006, $8,191,000 in 2005, and $7,974,000 in 2004. At December 31, 2006, the approximate future minimum base rent and non-obligated debt service rent to be paid by us on non-cancelable operating leases with NHI during the initial term are as follows Total

337,000,000 Advisory Agreement Until November 1, 2004, we had an Advisory Agreement with NHI whereby we provided to NHI services related to investment activities and day-to-day management and operations. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, our fees under the NHI Advisory Agreement was $-0-, $-0-, and $2,383,000, respectively. Effective November 1, 2004, NHC=s Advisory Agreement with NHI was terminated. On that date, Management Advisory Source, LLC AAdvisors@, a new unrelated company formed by Mr. W. Andrew Adams, undertook to provide advisory services to NHI. Mr. Adams served as NHI=s President and Board Chairman and as NHC=s Chief Executive Officer and Board Chairman prior to November 1, 2004. Effective November 1, 2004 and to enhance independence from NHC, Mr. Adams resigned as NHC=s Chief Executive Officer and terminated his managerial responsibilities with NHC. Mr. Adams remains on the NHC Board as Chairman, focusing on strategic planning, but will have no management involvement with NHC. 
Effective November 1, 2004, NHC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tennessee Management Advisory Source, LLC ATHA@ entered into an agreement to provide financial, accounting, data processing and administrative services to Advisors. Under the agreement, THA provided to Advisors and, at the request of Advisors, to NHI, services related to accounting, data processing, administration and evaluation of investments. THA=s role under the agreement was that of advisor and service provider, and THA in no way assumed responsibility for accounting, administrative, or investment decisions which are to be made by Advisors or NHI. 
On March 13, 2006, we announced an agreement with National Health Investors, Inc. NHI to end the use of NHC=s senior officers as advisors to NHI, effective on or about December 31, 2006. NHC=s Board believes it to be in the best interest of NHC to accentuate its independence from NHI, its largest landlord.
Effective December 31, 2006, NHC=s agreement to provide services to Advisors was terminated. 
For our services under the agreement, we were entitled to compensation of $1,250,000 per year, payable monthly and annually inflated by 5%. We received compensation of approximately $1,313,000, $1,250,000 and $-0- in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. No such compensation is expected to be received in 2007. 63 Management Services NHI operated certain long-term health care centers on which it had foreclosed, had accepted deeds in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise had obtained possession of the related assets. NHI engaged us to manage these foreclosure properties from 2000 through 2004. See Notes 1 and 5 for additional information on management fees recognized from these NHI owned properties. During 2004 or prior, NHI sold or closed all of these properties and NHC now manages for others the properties that continue to operate.
Accounting Treatment of the Transfer We have accounted for the conveyance in 1991 of assets and related debt to NHI and the subsequent leasing of the real estate assets as a Afinancing/leasing@ arrangement. Since we were obligated on certain of the transferred debt, the obligated debt balances were reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as debt serviced by other parties. As of December 31, 2006, we were not obligated on any debt serviced by other parties. As we utilize the applicable real estate over the lease term, our consolidated statements of income will reflect the continued interest expenses on the obligated debt balances and the additional base and non-obligated debt service rents as an operating expense payable to NHI each year. We have indemnification provisions in our agreements with NHI if we are required to service the debt through a default by NHI.
Release from Debt Serviced by Other Parties Since 1991, we have been released from our obligation on a significant portion of transferred debt $930,000 in 2006. Since we are no longer obligated on this transferred debt, debt serviced by other parties and assets under arrangement with other parties were reduced by the amount of the debt serviced by other parties from which we were removed. The resulting deferred lease credit is being amortized into income over the remaining lease term. The leases with NHI provide that we shall continue to make non-obligated debt service rent payments equal to the debt service including principal and interest on the obligated debt from which we have been released. At December 31, 2005 no debt serviced by other parties remained and as of December 31, 2006, NHC is no longer obligated to make non-obligated debt service rent payments.
Investment in NHI Common Stock At December 31, 2006, we own 1,045,642 shares or 51% of NHI=s outstanding common stock. We account for our investment in NHI common stock as available for sale marketable securities in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 115. Note 4 - Relationship with National Health Corporation
National, which is wholly-owned by the National Health Corporation Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan AESOP@, was formed in 1986 and served as our administrative general partner through December 31, 1997, when we operated as a master limited partnership. As discussed below, the personnel conducting our business, including our executive management team, are employees of National and have ownership interests in National through their participation in the ESOP. 64 Sale of Long-Term Health Care Centers to and Notes Receivable from National During 1988, we sold the assets inventory, property and equipment of eight long-term health care centers 1,121 licensed beds to National for a total consideration of $40,000,000. The consideration consisted of $30,000,000 in cash and a $10,000,000 note receivable due December 31, 2007. The note receivable earns interest at 85%. We have agreed to manage the centers under a 20-year management contract for management fees comparable to those in the industry. With our prior consent, National sold one center to an unrelated third party in 1997 and two centers to an unrelated third party in 1999. Thus, we now manage five centers for National. See Notes 1 and 5 for additional information on management fees recognized from National.
Our carrying amount in the assets sold in 1988 to National was approximately $24,255,000. The resulting profit of $15,745,000 was deferred and will be amortized into income beginning with the collection of the note receivable up to $12,000,000 with the balance $3,745,000 of the profit being amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the management contract period.
In conjunction with our management contract, we have entered into a line of credit arrangement whereby we may have amounts due to or due from National from time to time. The maximum available borrowings under the line of credit are $2,000,000, the interest rate on the line of credit is prime plus one percent and the final maturity is January 1, 2008. National owes NHC $6,351,000 at December 31, 2006 and we owed National $1,181,000 at December 31, 2004 under this arrangement. These amounts have been included in or netted against notes receivable from National on the consolidated balance sheets. After January 1, 2008, we will no longer be obligated to make loans under the line of credit arrangement. We may, however, make short-term loans in the regular course of business. 
ESOP Financing Activities During 1988, we obtained from National long-term financing of $8,500,000 for the construction of our headquarters building. National obtained its financing through the ESOP. The note requires quarterly principal and interest payments with interest at 9% and is secured by the headquarters building. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the outstanding balance on the note was approximately $519,000 and $1,038,000, respectively, which is included in notes and other obligations in Note 10. The building is owned by a separate partnership of which we are the general partner and building tenants are limited partners. We own 965% of the partnership and consolidate the financial statements of the partnership in our consolidated financial statements. The cumulative equity in earnings of the partnership related to the limited partners= ownership is reflected in minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries.
We have guaranteed the debt service of the building partnership.
In addition, our $4,634,000 senior secured notes payable described in Note 10 were financed by National. National obtained its financing through the ESOP. Our interest costs, financing expenses and principal payments with National are consistent with National and the ESOP=s terms with their respective lenders. We also have agreed to guarantee $7,564,000 of additional debt of National and the ESOP that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 13 for additional information on guarantees. 
In May 2004, we repaid in full our senior notes in the approximate amount of $1,486,000.
During 1991, we borrowed $10,000,000 from National. The term note payable requires quarterly interest payments at 85%. The entire principal is due at maturity in 2008. 65 Payroll and Related Services The personnel conducting our business, including our executive management team, are employees of National and have ownership interests in National through their participation in the ESOP. National provides payroll services, provides employee fringe benefits, and maintains certain liability insurance. We pay to National all the costs of personnel employed for our benefit, as well as an administrative fee equal to 1% of payroll costs. Such costs totaling approximately $302,862,000, $285,000,000, and $276,000,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are reflected as salaries, wages and benefits in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The administrative fee paid to National for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $2,700,000, $2,393,000, and $2,303,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 National owes us $6,351,000 and at December 31, 2004, we owed National $1,181,000 as a result of the differences between interim payments for payroll 
and benefits services costs that we made during the respective year and such actual costs. These receivables are included in or netted against notes receivable from National in the consolidated balance sheets. National maintains and makes contributions to its ESOP for the benefit of eligible employees.
National=s Ownership of Our Stock At December 31, 2006 and 2005, National owns 1,238,924 shares or approximately 99% of our outstanding common stock. Note 5 - Other Revenues and Income
Other revenues are outlined in the table below. Revenues from insurance services include premiums for workers= compensation and professional and general liability insurance policies that our wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries have written for certain long-term health care centers to which we provide management or accounting services. Revenues from management and accounting services include management and accounting fees and revenues from other services provided to managed and other long-term health care centers. AOther@ revenues include non-health care related earnings.

$57,158 Management Fees from National We have managed long-term care centers for National since 1988 and we currently manage five centers. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our relationship with National. 66 During 2006, 2005 and 2004, National paid and we recognized approximately $29,000, $867,000 and $2,407,000, respectively, of management fees and interest on management fees, which amounts are included in management and accounting service fees. Unrecognized management fees from National total $12,936,000, $10,775,000, and $8,908,000 at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We have recognized approximately $25,504,000 of management fees and interest from these centers since 1988. 
The unpaid fees from these five centers, because the amount collectable could not be reasonably determined when the management services were provided, and because we cannot estimate the timing or amount of expected future collections, will be recognized as revenues only when fixed or determinable and collectibility of these fees can be reasonably assured. Under the terms of our management agreement with National, the payment of these fees to us may be subordinated to other expenditures of the five long-term care centers. We continue to manage these centers so that we may be able to collect our fees in the future and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services to a center may be small compared to the potential benefit. We may receive payment for the unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investing activities of the five centers are sufficient to pay the fees. There 
can be no assurance that such future improved cash flows will occur. 
Management Fees from NHI NHI in the past operated certain long-term health care centers on which it had foreclosed, accepted deeds in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise obtained possession of the related assets. NHI engaged us to manage these foreclosure properties from 2000 through 2004. During 2004 or prior, NHI sold or closed all of these properties and NHC now manages for others the properties that continue to operate. 
During 2006, 2005, and 2004, we recognized $-0-, $8,500,000, and $1,480,000, respectively, of management fees from long-term care centers owned by NHI, which amounts are included in management and accounting service fees. Unrecognized and unpaid management fees from NHI total $5,040,000, $5,040,000 and $13,540,000 at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We collected a total of approximately $11,642,000 management fees over the terms of our agreements with NHI. Under the terms of our management agreements, the receipt of payment for these fees was subordinated to other expenditures of the long-term care centers managed. Consistent with our policy, we will recognize these unrecognized fees as revenue only if realized. Because we discontinued services to these centers in 2004, the likelihood of collection of the unrecognized and unpaid amount at December 31, 2006 is considered to be remote. 
Management Fees from Nursing Centers Formerly Owned by NHI
We continue to manage 18 long-term care centers that were previously owned by NHI, as described above. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized $2,792,000, $2,662,000 and $3,657,000, respectively, of management fees and interest from these 18 long-term care centers. Unrecognized and unpaid management fees from these centers total $3,628,000, $3,961,000 and $1,103,000 at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We have recognized approximately $10,310,000 of management fees and interest from these centers since 2002.
Of the total 18 centers managed, the management fee revenues from eight centers were currently paid and recognized on the accrual method in 2006. The fees from the remaining ten centers, because of insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections, are recognized only when realized. Under the terms of our management agreements, the payment of these fees to us may be subordinated to other expenditures of each of the long-term care providers. We continue to manage these centers so that we may be able to collect our fees in the future and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services to a center may be small compared to the potential benefit. We may receive payment for the unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from operating and investing activities of the centers are sufficient to pay the fees. There can be no assurance that such future improved cash flow
s will occur. 67 Accounting Service Fees and Rental Income from Florida Centers During 2006, 2005, and 2004, we recognized $6,121,000, $5,220,000, and $5,274,000, respectively, of accounting services fees from long-term health care centers in Florida that we previously operated or managed. Amounts recognized are included in management and accounting service fees. 
During 2006, 2005, and 2004, we also recognized $2,557,000, $3,250,000, and $3,543,000, respectively, of rental income from the divested operations of long-term health care centers in Florida related to our two owned facilities and the furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements of 13 other facilities previously leased from NHI and NHR. These amounts are included in rental income.
Discontinued Management Agreement Effective December 31, 2006, our contract to manage a 176-bed long-term care center in Aiken, South Carolina was terminated when the County of Aiken, South Carolina completed the sale of the facility to a third party. We earned approximately $500,000 in 2006 in management fee revenues from the facility. Note 6 - Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share assumes the exercise of options using the treasury stock method.

At December 31, 2006, we have notes receivable from National of approximately $16,351,000. 
In addition to our notes receivable from National, we have notes receivable from managed and other long-term health care centers, the proceeds of which were used by the long-term health care centers for construction costs, development costs incurred during construction and working capital during initial operating periods. The notes generally require monthly payments with maturities beginning in 2006 through 2007. Interest on the notes is generally at rates ranging from prime plus 2% to 7%. The collateral for the notes consists of first and second mortgages, certificates of need, personal guarantees and stock pledges. 
On June 30, 2006, we collected a note receivable in the amount of $7,309,000 which had previously been written off in 1994. The collection is reported as a recovery of notes receivable in the consolidated statement of income.
In March, 2005, we recorded a $1,000,000 writedown of a note receivable due from a 120 bed long-term health care center in Missouri that we manage. The writedown was recorded as a result of the lack of increase in reimbursement rates and a resulting decline in the cash flows of the center. The center has not made a principal payment on this note since December 31, 2001. Based on an analysis consistent with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, AAccounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 5 and 15@, we concluded that the writedown of $1,000,000 was required. 70 Note 10 - Long-Term Debt, Debt Serviced by Other Parties and Lease Commitments

Certain loan agreements require maintenance of specified operating ratios as well as specified levels of working capital and stockholders= equity by us and by National. All such covenants have been met by us and we believe that National is in compliance with or has obtained waivers or amendments to remedy all events of non-compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2006. 71 Construction Commitments NHC has entered into agreements to complete construction of leasehold improvements at various long-term health care facilities at December 31, 2006. We remain obligated in the amount of approximately $9,695,000 on construction contracts.
Lease Commitments Operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 include expenses for leased premises and equipment under operating leases of $40,310,000, $42,049,000, and $41,034,000, respectively.

$16,083 The exercise of non-qualified stock options results in state and federal income tax benefits to the Company related to the difference between the market price at the date of exercise and the option exercise price. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, $1,343,000, $207,000, and $6,359,000, respectively, attributable to the tax benefit of stock options exercised, was credited to additional paid-in capital. 
We experienced a one-time benefit of $4,205,000 in the fourth quarter of 2006 from the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to changed facts and circumstances, issue resolutions, and statute of limitation expirations concerning positions taken in our tax returns. We are no longer subject to federal and state examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003. Currently there are no federal or state returns under examination.
We believe that our reserves reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Our tax reserves are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within Other Noncurrent Liabilities except for amounts relating to items we expect to pay within one year which are within other current liabilities.
NHC continually evaluates for tax related contingencies. Contingencies may arise where tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment. We believe we have adequate provisions for tax contingencies. However, because of uncertainty of interpretation by various tax authorities and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized by management, we cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities. We believe we have made adequate provision for tax contingencies. 73 Note 12 - Stock Option Plan
Our shareholders approved the 2005 Stock Option, Employee Stock Purchase, Physician Stock Purchase and Stock Appreciation Rights Plan the APlan@ which provides for the grant of stock options to key employees, directors and non-employee consultants. Under the Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors Athe Committee@ has the authority to select the participants to be granted options; to designate whether the option granted is an incentive stock option AISO@, a non-qualified option, or a stock appreciation right; to establish the number of shares of common stock that may be issued upon exercise of the option; to establish the vesting provision for any award; and to establish the term any award ma
y be outstanding. The exercise price of any ISO=s granted will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date granted and the term of an ISO may not be any more than ten years. The exercise price of any non-qualified options granted will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date granted unless so determined by the Committee. 
Under the Plan, options issued to non-employee directors are granted automatically on the date of our annual shareholder meeting, vest immediately upon grant and have a maximum five year term. Options issued to employees in 2000 vest over a six year period and have a maximum six year term. Options issued to employees in 2004 vest over a five year period and have a maximum five year term. 
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date, using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions indicated in the following table. Generally, awards are subject to cliff vesting. Each grant is valued as a single award with an expected term based upon expected participants and termination behavior. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period in a manner consistent with the option vesting provisions. The straight-line attribution method requires that compensation expense is recognized at least equal to the portion of the grant-date fair value that is vested at that date. The expected volatility is derived using daily historical data for periods immediately preceding the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on the United States Treasury Strips having a life equal to the expected option life on the date of grant. The expecte
d life is an estimate of the number of years an option will be held before it is exercised.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at December 31, 2006 is 24 years. The total intrinsic value of shares exercised during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $7,832,000.
Additionally, we have an employee stock purchase plan that allows employees to purchase our shares of stock through payroll deductions. The plan allows employees to terminate participation at any time.
Our policy is to issue new shares to satisfy share option exercises. In May 2005, our shareholders approved the 2005 National HealthCare Corporation Stock Option, Employee Stock Purchase, Physician Stock Purchase and Stock Appreciation Rights Plan. We have reserved 884,473 shares of common stock for issuance under these plans.
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123revised 2004, AShare-Based Payment@ ASFAS 123R@, using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this method, compensation cost is recognized, beginning January 1, 2006, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date, and based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, AAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation ASFAS 123@, for all awards granted to employees prior to January 1, 2006 that remain unvested on the effective date. Prior to January 1, 2006, we applied Accounting Principles Boa
rd Opinion No. 25, AAccounting for Stock Issued to Employees@ AAPB 25@ and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock benefit plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost was recognized for stock options granted under the 75 plans because the exercise prices for options granted were equal to the quoted market prices on the option grant dates and all option grants were to employees or directors. Results for prior periods have not been restated. 
As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, NHC recognized $2,309,000 of compensation expense for the year. At December 31, 2006, SFAS 123R requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of amounts recognized as compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than an operating cash flow, as required under prior accounting guidance. Tax deductions in excess of amounts recognized as compensation costs totaled $3,357,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. No share based compensation cost was capitalized during the current period. The total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized is $2,478,000 and the weighted average period over which it is to be recognized is 23 years. Note 13 - Contingencies and Guarantees
Self Insurance We have assumed certain self-insurance risks related to health insurance, workers= compensation and general and professional liability insurance claims both for our owned or leased entities and certain of the entities to which we provide management or accounting services. The liability we have recognized for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims totals $76,471,000 and $70,290,000 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This liability is classified as current based on the uncertainty regarding the timing of potential payments. The liability is included in accrued risk reserves in the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts are subject to adjustment for actual claims incurred. It is possible that these claims plus unasserted claims could exceed our insurance coverages and our reserves, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of op
erations and cash flows.
As a result of the terms of our insurance policies and our use of a wholly-owned insurance company, we have retained significant insurance risk with respect to general and professional liability. We use independent actuaries to estimate our exposures for claims obligations for both asserted and unasserted claims related to deductibles and exposures in excess of coverage limits, and we maintain reserves for these obligations. Such estimates are based on many variables including historical and statistical information and other factors. It is possible that claims against us could exceed our coverage limits and our reserves, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
Workers= Compensation
For workers= compensation, we utilize a wholly-owned Tennessee domiciled property/casualty insurance company to write coverage for NHC affiliates and for third-party customers. Policies are written for a duration of twelve months and cover only risks related to workers= compensation losses. All customers are companies which operate in the long-term care industry. Business is written on both an assumed and a direct basis. For the business written on an assumed basis the insurance company assumes only the first $750,000 of losses for each claim. For direct business, coverage is written for statutory limits and the insurance company=s losses in excess of $500,000 per claim are covered by reinsurance. 
For these insurance operations, the premium revenues reflected in the financial statements as AOther revenues@ for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are $9,481,000, $13,554,000, and $12,996,000. Associated losses and expenses reflected in the financial statements as AOther operating costs and expenses@ are $219,000, $2,017,000, and $4,292,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 76 General and Professional Liability Lawsuits and Insurance
Across the nation, the entire long term care industry has experienced a dramatic increase in personal injury/wrongful death claims and awards based on alleged negligence by nursing facilities and their employees in providing care to residents. As of December 31, 2006, we and/or our managed centers are currently defendants in 64 such claims covering the years 1995 through December 31, 2006. Fourteen of the 64 suits are in Florida, where we have not operated or managed long-term care providers since September 30, 2000. Of the fourteen Florida suits, seven suits relate to events before and seven suits relate to events after our cessation of business in Florida. These latter seven suits assert allegations of continued exposure even after we ceased operations. 
When bids were solicited for third party professional liability insurance coverage for 2002, only two companies would quote coverage. Both quotations were so onerous and expensive that we elected to pay the premiums into a wholly-owned licensed captive insurance company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, for the purpose of managing the Company=s losses related to these risks. Thus, for years 2002-2006, insurance coverage for incidents occurring at all providers owned or leased, and most providers managed by us, is provided through this wholly-owned insurance company. Policies are written for a duration of twelve months.
Our coverages for all years include both primary policies and excess policies. Commending with 2002, deductibles were eliminated with first dollar coverage being provided through the wholly-owned insurance company. The excess coverage is provided by a third party insuror for 2002. 
For 2003-2006, both primary professional liability insurance coverage and excess coverage is provided through our wholly-owned liability insurance company in the amount of $1 million per incident, $3 million per location with an aggregate primary policy limit of $120 million, $140 million, and $140 million, respectively. There is a $75 million annual excess aggregate applicable to each year.
For these professional liability insurance operations, the premium revenues reflected in the financials as AOther revenues@ for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are $3,823,000, $4,095,000, and $3,852,000. Associated losses and expenses including those for self-insurance are included in the financial statements as AOther operating costs and expenses@. These costs total $6,320,000, $4,271,000, and $15,703,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Nashville Fire
On September 25, 2003, a tragic fire occurred on the second floor of a skilled nursing facility located in Nashville, Tennessee operated by one of our limited liability company subsidiaries. While the concrete and steel constructed facility complied with applicable fire safety codes, the building was not equipped with fire sprinklers. Although the fire was predominantly confined to a patient=s room, extensive smoke filled the area and caused injuries to other patients despite aggressive efforts to evacuate these patients by NHC employees, fire department personnel and other volunteers. There were sixteen patient deaths subsequent to the fire, an undetermined number of which may be related to the events of September 25, 2003.
The fire produced extensive media coverage, specifically focused on the fact that health care centers, including hospitals, constructed prior to 1994 are not required by Tennessee law or regulations to be fully sprinkled if constructed with fire resistant materials. Irrespective of code standards, we undertook to install fire sprinklers in all of owned and leased long-term care centers, which installation is now completed. We proactively sought to resolve any questions and/or losses with patients and their families. Of a total of 32 lawsuits filed against us, all have been settled, the last two cases being settled in November, 2006.
Additionally, in connection with the fire, we have incurred losses and costs associated with interruption of business, as we have closed the center. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we received or accrued $1,404,000 of insurance recoveries from third-party insurance carriers. Amounts of insurance recoveries received in 2005 are immaterial in amount when netted against the related expenses. These insurance recoveries reduced our losses and costs and were included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
The building involved in the fire was leased by one of our limited liability company subsidiaries from National Health Investors, Inc. NHI. We terminated the lease during the third quarter of 2004. A provision of the lease allowed that if substantial damage occurred during the lease term, we could terminate the lease with respect to the damaged property. Under the lease, NHC had no obligation to repair the property and NHI was entitled to all insurance proceeds related to the building damage. We are obligated to continue to indemnify and hold harmless NHI from any and all demands arising from our use of the property. NHI retained the right to license the beds under the lease termination. NHC terminated the Nashville lease with NHI.
Consistent with the provisions of SFAS 5, we accrued for probable and estimatible losses related to the Nashville fire and included our estimates of these losses in accrued risk reserves in the consolidated balance sheets. All such estimates are adjusted to actual results when outcomes are known.
Debt Guarantees In addition to our primary debt obligations, which are included in our consolidated financial statements, we have guaranteed the debt obligations of certain other entities. Those guarantees, which are not included as debt obligations in our consolidated financial statements, total $11,052,000 at December 31, 2006 and include $5,155,000 of debt of managed and other long-term health care centers and $5,897,000 of debt of National and the ESOP. 
The $5,155,000 of guarantees of debt of managed and other long-term health care centers relates to debt obligations of seven long-term health care centers to which we provide management or accounting services. We have agreed to guarantee these obligations in order to obtain management or accounting services agreements. For this service, we charge an annual guarantee fee of 05% to 20% of the outstanding principal balance guaranteed, which fee is in addition to our management or accounting services fee. All of this guaranteed indebtedness is secured by first mortgages, pledges of personal property, accounts receivable, marketable securities and, in certain instances, the personal guarantees of the owners of the facilities.
The $5,897,000 of guarantees of debt of National and the ESOP relates to senior secured notes held by financial institutions. The total outstanding balance of National and the ESOP=s obligations under these senior secured notes is $8,010,000. Of this obligation, $2,113,000 has been included in our debt obligations because we are a direct obligor on this indebtedness. The remaining $5,897,000, which is not included in our debt obligations because we are not a direct obligor, is due from NHI to National and the ESOP. Additionally, under the amended terms dated March 31, 2005 of these note agreements, the right of the lending institutions to require NHC to purchase the notes at par value under a guaranty and contingency purchase agreement has been removed. 
The $2,133,000 of senior secured notes payable and the $5897,000 guarantee described above have cross-default provisions with other debt of National and the ESOP. We currently believe that National and the ESOP are in compliance with the terms of their debt agreements.
As of December 31, 2006, our maximum potential loss related to the aforementioned debt guarantees and financial guarantees is $11,052,000 which is the outstanding balance of our guarantees. We have accrued approximately $1,044,000 for potential losses as a result of our guarantees. 77 Note 14 - Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. We calculate the fair values of other financial instruments based upon our estimate of current industry conditions and relevant factors. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no material differences between the carrying amounts and fair values of NHC=s financial instruments.
To meet the reporting requirements of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, ADisclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments@, we calculate the fair value of financial instruments using discounted cash flow techniques. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no material differences between the carrying amounts and fair values of our financial instruments. Note 15 - Selected Quarterly Financial Data

In addition, we experienced a one-time benefit of $4,025,000 in the fourth quarter of 2006 from the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to changed facts and circumstances, issue resolutions, and statute of limitation expirations concerning positions taken in our tax returns. We are no longer subject to federal and state examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003. Note 16 - Purchase of Healthcare Center
On March 1, 2006, we purchased for $5,400,000 a 200 bed health care center located in Town Country, Missouri. The health care center was purchased from SeniorTrust of Murfreesboro, Tennessee. NHC has been managing the center since 2001. NHC provides management and/or accounting services for nine centers owned by SeniorTrust and located in Kansas, Missouri and Tennessee. The operating results for the acquired healthcare center are included in the 2006 consolidated statement of income from the acquisition date. Pro forma disclosure related to the acquisition is not material. 78 Note 17. Proposed Merger Agreement Between National HealthCare Corporation and National Health Realty, Inc.
On December 20, 2006, National HealthCare Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, NHC/OP, L.P. and Davis Acquisition Sub LLC and National Health Realty, Inc., entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger the AMerger Agreement@. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to receipt of the required stockholder vote, National Health Realty, Inc. will consolidate with its wholly-owned subsidiary New NHR, Inc., as the result of which a new Maryland corporation the AConsolidated Company@ will be formed. Subject to the receipt of the required stockholder vote, regulatory approval and consummation of certain other transactions specified in the Merger Agreement, the Consolidated Company will be merged with and into Davis Acquisition Sub LLC the A
Merger@ which will continue as a wholly-owned subsidiary of NHC/OP, L.P. and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of the Consolidated Company.
Pursuant to the merger agreement, each outstanding common share of NHR not owned by Davis Acquisition Sub LLC, NHC/OP, L.P., or NHC, will be converted into the right to receive one share of NHC Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, plus $900 in cash. Each share of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to cumulative annual preferred dividends of $080 per share and will have a liquidation preference of $1575 per share. The Preferred Stock will be listed on the American Stock Exchange and will be convertible at any time at the option of the holder into 024204 shares of National HealthCare Corporation common stock, subject to adjustment. The transaction will require cash of approximately $90,000,000. In addition to NHC=s operating cash, we may borrow from our captive insurance company subject to regulatory requirements or sell marketable securities. 
It is expected that both National HealthCare Corporation and National Health Realty, Inc. will hold special meetings of each company=s shareholders at a future date to consider matters related to the Merger Agreement and that a joint proxy statement/prospectus will be issued by the companies. 
The board of directors of NHC has approved the Merger Agreement and the Merger and has determined that the Merger is in the best interest of NHC shareholders. The board believes that the combined company will provide the present shareholders of NHC with a more focused and efficient corporation whose interests are more closely aligned with those of its shareholders. Furthermore, we believe that the Merger will i provide NHC with a larger asset and equity base that is anticipated to enhance NHC=s future growth and prospects for long-term increased in stockholder value, ii provide NHC with greater operating flexibility to renovate and expand its facilities; iii free NHC management from the burden of having to manage two publicly traded companies, and allow NHC management to devote more time to the management of NHC=s core business operations; iv negate the possibility t
hat NHR could be acquired by a competitor of NHC; and v broaden NHC=s access to debt financing sources. Following the merger, NHC will no longer be required to make lease payments to NHR. Assuming the continuation of current operating trends, the elimination of such required lease payments will result in a substantial increase in the annual recurring free cash flow of NHC, even after providing for the preferred dividends which NHC will be required to pay on the Preferred Stock. In addition, the merger will eliminate the financial uncertainty that resulted from the periodic negotiation and renegotiation of the leasing terms of the properties that NHR leased to NHC. Due to recent changes with respect to the taxation of corporate dividends, the merger is now feasible from a U.S. federal tax perspective. Because of a change in the U.S. federal tax law which reduced the tax rate applicable to dividends paid to stockholders of C corporations
such as NHC, the relative tax advantages of operating NHR=s business under the REIT structure have been greatly reduced.
Completion of the Merger is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust review and approval by shareholders of National HealthCare Corporation of the NHC Proposal and shareholders of National Health Realty, Inc. of the NHR Proposal. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures - Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2006, the president and principal accounting officer of the Company have concluded that the Company=s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC=s rules and instructions for Form 10-K. MANAGEMENT=S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ACOSO@ in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. We have concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, BDO Seidman, LLP, has issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. 79 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
National HealthCare Corporation
Murfreesboro, Tennessee
We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management=s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that National HealthCare Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. National HealthCare Corporation and Subsidiaries= management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposit
ion of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, management assessment that National HealthCare Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway, Commission COSO. Also in our opinion, National HealthCare Corporation and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of National HealthCare Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders= equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 and our report dated March 16, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ BDO Seidman, LLP
Nashville, Tennessee
March 16, 2007
Changes in Internal Control - There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Our management, including our President and Principal Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, with NHC have been detected.
