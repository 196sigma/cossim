DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2003  Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies  Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial
statements of Deltic Timber Corporation Deltic or the Company include the accounts of Deltic and all majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of significant intercompany transactions and accounts.  Use of Estimates In the preparation of the Companys
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management has made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates.  Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include U.S. government securities that have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a review of
the specific receivables outstanding. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the balance in the allowance account was $107,000 and $88,000, respectively.  Inventories Inventories of logs, lumber, and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market, primarily using the average cost method.
Log costs include harvest and transportation cost as appropriate. Lumber costs include materials, labor, and production overhead. For additional information, see Note 3 Inventories.  Investment in Real Estate Held for Development and Sale Real
estate held for development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs, including amenities. These costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold
based on relative sales value. Direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis, while indirect costs for the Companys three development areas Chenal Valley, Chenal Downs, and Red Oak Ridge are allocated to
neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail values.  Investment in Del-Tin Fiber Investment in Del-Tin Fiber L.L.C. Del-Tin Fiber, a 50 percent-owned limited liability company, is carried at cost and is adjusted for the Companys
proportionate share of its undistributed earnings or losses. The Companys equity-method-basis carrying value for its investment in Del-Tin Fiber is evaluated for possible impairment, as applicable under the requirements of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB 18. This evaluation as of December 31, 2002, based on the intent of the Companys Board of Directors to exit the business, resulted in a determination that the Companys investment was impaired as
of December 31, 2002, and the carrying amount of the investment was written off, to zero, for the 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. On December 11, 2003, the Companys Board of Directors revised its intent in regard to selling Deltics
interest in the joint venture, and the resulting evaluation of fair value for the related investment indicated that fair value exceeded carrying value at December 31, 2003. For additional information, see Note 4 Investment in Del-Tin Fiber.
Timber and Timberlands Timber and timberlands,
which includes purchased stumpage inventory and logging facilities, is stated at acquisition cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities and includes no estimated future reforestation cost. The cost of
fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable. Logging facilities, which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements, are depreciated using the
straight-line method over a ten-year estimated life. The Company estimates its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques. The cost of timber and
timberland purchased and reforestation costs are capitalized. Fee timber carrying costs are expensed as incurred. 
43 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2003  Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont. 
Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight-line method. Expenditures that substantially improve and/or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment
are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses on disposals or retirements are included in income as they occur.  Property, plant, and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as applicable,
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted
future net cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the
asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation ceases.  Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of lumber and wood by-products is recorded at the time of shipment. Revenue from the sale of
timber-cutting rights to third parties is recorded when legal title passes to the purchaser, which is generally upon delivery of a legally executed timber deed and receipt of payment for the timber. Revenue from intersegment timber sales is recorded
when the timber is harvested; such intersegment sales, which are generally made at prices which approximate market, are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Revenue from timberland and real estate sales is recorded when the sale is
closed and legal title is transferred, which is generally at the time the purchaser executes the real estate closing documents and makes payment to the title company handling the closing.  Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities, based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the
tax bases of existing assets and liabilities, and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance which is established when it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
Stock-Based Compensation At December 31, 2003, Deltic had
two stock-based compensation plans for which the Company applies the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for those plans. Stock-based employee
compensation expense is accrued for the intrinsic value, if any, of stock options or restricted stock granted over the applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method. Options granted by the Company have an exercise price equal to the
market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. As of November 2001, the Company eliminated certain option exercise procedures, resulting in a change to fixed-plan accounting treatment for all options. Prior to that date, the
Company was required to apply variable plan accounting standards which required adjustment of the cost of options granted for changes in the market value per share of the Companys common stock. For additional information, see Note 15 
Incentive Plans.

The effect on net income/loss and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, for the years ended December 31 consisted of the following:
Thousands of dollars, except per share amounts
2003 2002 2001 Net income/loss, as reported 8,703 13,639 9,980 Plus total stock-based compensation expense determined under the intrinsic value method for awards, net of related tax effects, included in
the determination of net income 220 431 402 Less pro forma total stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value method for all awards, net of related tax
effects 769 937 785 Pro forma net income/loss 8,154 14,145 9,597 Basic earnings per share As reported 73 133 65 Pro forma 68 138 62 Dilutive earnings per share As reported 73 133 65 Pro forma 68 138 61
For the pro forma net
income calculation in the preceding table, the fair value of each option on the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the following assumptions for awards in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively: dividend yields
of 101 percent, 106 percent, and 106 percent; expected volatility of 3279 percent, 3119 percent, and 3852 percent; risk-free interest rates of 486 percent, 437 percent, and 508 percent; and expected lives of five years. Using these
assumptions, the weighted average grant-date fair value per share of options granted in 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $796, $926, and $905, respectively.  Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company sponsors both a qualified and a nonqualified, noncontributory, defined benefit
retirement plan that covers substantially all employees. Benefits are based on years of service and final career-average-pay formulas as defined by the plans. The qualified plan is funded to accumulate sufficient assets to provide for accrued
benefits. The nonqualified plan, a supplemental executive plan, is not funded; the Company pays any benefits due under this plan on a monthly basis.  The Company also sponsors a defined benefit health care plan and a life insurance benefit plan for substantially all retired employees. The Company
measures the costs of its obligations for these plans based on its best estimate. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn these postretirement benefits.

Advertising Costs Advertising costs, primarily related to marketing efforts for the
Companys real estate developments, are expensed as incurred. These costs amounted to $638,000 in 2003, $792,000 in 2002, and $725,000 in 2001 and are reflected in Cost of Sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Capitalized Interest The Company capitalizes interest for
qualifying assets constructed or otherwise produced for which interest on directly associated debt was incurred. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over the useful lives of those assets. 
Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures include additions
to Investment in Real Estate Held for Development and Sale; Timber and Timberlands; and Property, Plant, and Equipment.  Net Change in Purchased Stumpage Inventory Purchased stumpage inventory consists of timber-cutting rights purchased from third parties
specifically for use in the Companys sawmills. Depending on the timing of acquisition and usage of this acquired stumpage inventory, the net change in inventory can either be a source or use of funds in the Companys Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.  Earnings per Common Share
Earnings per share EPS amounts presented are calculated under the provisions of the SFAS 128, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed based on earnings available to common shareholders [net income/loss less
accrued preferred dividends] and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The earnings per share assuming dilution amounts presented are computed based on earnings available to common shareholders and the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding, including shares assumed to be issued under the Companys stock option plans. For a reconciliation of amounts used in per share computations, see Note 17 Earnings per Share.  Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and associated retirement costs and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. Adoption of SFAS 143 did not have an effect on the
Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and
measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred, and is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company has not initiated any such exit or disposal activities in 2003; therefore,
adoption of SFAS 146 has had no impact on the Companys financial statements.  In November 2002, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others. It clarified that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The recognition and measurement provisions of FIN
45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company has issued no such guarantees in 2003. 
46 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2003  Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont. 
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition
and Disclosure. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends
the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require more prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements. The
Company currently applies the accounting measurement provisions of APB 25 to account for stock-based compensation and has not adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148; however, it has adopted the disclosure requirements
of both SFAS 123 and SFAS 148.  In January 2003, the FASB
issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation addresses consolidation of certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient
equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The consolidation provisions of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and
in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2003, for variable interest entities acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company has not created or obtained an interest in any such entities since January 31, 2003, and the
statement is not expected to have an impact in fiscal year 2004 as a result of the Companys evaluation of its investment in Del-Tin Fiber under the provisions of FIN 46. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities. This statement
1 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative, 2 clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component, and 3 amends the definition of an underlying to
conform to FIN 45. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, with all provisions applied prospectively. The Company has no derivative instruments and is not currently engaged in hedging activities,
accordingly, adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.  In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This statement
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify an instrument that is within its scope as a liability. SFAS 150 is
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no financial instruments
within the scope of SFAS 150.  In December 2003, the FASB
issued SFAS 132 revised 2003, Employer Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. SFAS 132 revised 2003 revises disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or
recognition of those plans. It requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans and is effective for financial
statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. For additional information regarding these disclosures, see Note 14 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans. 
47 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2003  Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont. 
In January 2004, the FASB issued a FASB Staff Position regarding SFAS 106, Employers Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions, FSP FAS 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which allowed companies to recognize or defer
recognizing the effects of the prescription-drug provisions of the new Medicare Act in their 2003 financial statements. Since Deltic had a September 30, 2003 measurement date for its benefit plans, the recognition or election to defer recognition
requirement will be effective for its first quarter 2004 financial statements, and it is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has not issued final guidance on
accounting for the provisions of the Medicare Act. Therefore, if the Company elects to record estimated benefits beginning in the first quarter of 2004, these benefits could be changed when final authoritative accounting guidance is issued in the
future.  Note 2 Discontinued Agriculture Segment  In August 2000, the Companys Board of Directors approved the disposal
of Deltics agriculture segment assets, subject to using the sales proceeds to purchase additional pine timberland, in a tax-deferred exchange. All 38,800 net acres formerly deemed to be agriculture lands, as well as all related agriculture
operational assets, had been sold by year-end 2001. As a result of the sales transactions completed during 2001, the Company realized a pretax gain on disposal of agriculture segment assets of $13,453,000 after related non-cash expenses of
$1,001,000.  Total net sales of the discontinued agriculture
segment for 2001, excluding asset sales proceeds, were $276,000. The gain on disposal of discontinued agriculture segment operations was $13,663,000 before income taxes, consisting of the $13,453,000 gain on sales of assets and $210,000 income from
operations since the measurement date. The net gain of $8,357,000, after related income taxes amounting to $5,306,000, is reported on the Companys 2001 Consolidated Statement of Income.  Since the Company disposed of the agriculture segment in a tax-deferred
exchange, all proceeds from the farmland sales were deposited with a qualified intermediary. In addition, Deltic also sold approximately 5,200 net acres of non-strategic Louisiana hardwood timberland during the third and fourth quarters of 2000,
which were also replaced with pine timberland in a tax-deferred exchange. These combined proceeds for 2000, $16,317,000 after deducting amounts expended during 2000 to purchase replacement pine timberland, were held by the intermediary, as trustee,
at December 31, 2000. These funds, in addition to similar proceeds received in 2001, were used during 2001 to acquire pine timberland designated as replacement property, with capital expenditures totaling $55,890,000.  Note 3 Inventories  Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following:  Thousands of dollars

For both financial and income tax purposes the Company utilizes the lower of cost or market basis for
determining inventory carrying values. Lumber inventory amounts at December 31, 2003 and 2002, are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value.  Note 4 Investment in Del-Tin Fiber  Deltic owns 50 percent of the membership of Del-Tin Fiber, which completed construction and commenced production operations of a medium density fiberboard
MDF plant near El Dorado, Arkansas, during 1998.  On April 25, 2002, Deltic announced that Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. had been retained as financial advisor to assist in the evaluation of strategic alternatives for the Companys investment in Del-Tin Fiber. Subsequently, Deltic
announced that following a review of these strategic alternatives, it was determined that the MDF business did not represent a growth area for the Company and that it intended to exit the MDF business upon the earliest, reasonable opportunity
provided by the market. As a result of this decision, the Companys evaluation of possible impairment of the carrying value of its investment in the equity method investee, as required by APB 18, was based primarily upon the estimated cash
flows from a sale of the Companys interest during 2003 and resulted in a determination that the Companys investment was impaired as of December 31, 2002, and the carrying amount of such investment was written off, to zero, for the
Companys 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The write-off, amounting to $18,723,000, was included in the 2002 fourth quarter operating results of the Company.  Due to the Companys commitment to fund its share of the facilitys operating working capital needs until the
facility was able to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements or Deltics ownership was sold, the Company continued to recognize its share of Del-Tin Fibers operating losses to the extent of these advances
during 2003. For the year, Deltics advances to the facility approximated its equity share of losses of the plant and amounted to $4,729,000. The Company also continued to utilize its management resources to work with Del-Tins management
and the joint-venture partner to improve operating performance at the plant. As a result of these improvements, on December 11, 2003, Deltics Board of Directors revised its intent regarding the Companys investment in Del-Tin Fiber and
ceased efforts to sell the Companys interest in the joint venture while continuing to improve operating and financial results of the plant. Due to this decision, Deltics evaluation of impairment as of December 31, 2003, was primarily
based upon the estimated future net cash flows from Del-Tin Fibers operations over the remaining life of the plant. Considering the Companys revised intent, the resulting estimated fair value of the Companys investment exceeded the
investments carrying value, which was zero as of December 31, 2003. The Company will continue to record its equity share of the operating results of the facility.  In performing the respective impairment evaluations, the Companys management made a number of estimates and
assumptions related to future operating results for Del-Tin Fiber, the sale of its ownership interest, the expected selling price for its investment if sold, and the ability to refinance the joint-ventures long-term debt. It is reasonably
possible that a change in these estimates and assumptions might occur, which could have a material impact on the Companys future financial statements. The management of Del-Tin Fiber has performed evaluations of possible impairment of the
long-lived assets of the plant in accordance with SFAS 121 and/or SFAS 144, as applicable. To-date, these analyses have indicated that no impairment exists at the Del-Tin Fiber level.

Del-Tin Fiber has its own credit facility, totaling $89,000,000 under which each owner has agreed to
a contingent equity contribution agreement with Del-Tin Fiber and the group of banks from whom the project financing was obtained. Under this agreement, both owners have contractually agreed to a contingent equity agreement which requires them to
fund any deficiency in contributions to either Del-Tin Fibers bond sinking fund or debt service reserve up to a cumulative total of $17,500,000 per owner. Del-Tin Fibers project financing agreement did not require sinking fund
contributions until the first quarter of 2001. Sinking fund deposits were $6,019,000 in 2001, $7,676,000 in 2002, and $8,956,000 in 2003, and are scheduled to be $10,457,000 in 2004 and $55,892,000 in 2005. In addition to the required sinking fund
deposits, Del-Tin Fiber has made deposits into debt service reserve funds that may be withdrawn solely to pay debt service to the extent sufficient funds are not available in the facilitys operating accounts. The total amount in these debt
service reserve funds, including interest accrued on deposited amounts, at December 31, 2003, was $3,521,000. The final sinking fund deposit would be reduced by the amount in debt service reserve funds and the amount of interest earned on the
accumulated balance of sinking fund deposits. To date, the owners have voluntarily funded all required sinking fund deposits, and thus have not reduced their respective contingent equity contribution agreement obligation, in order to obtain annual
renewals of the letters of credit supporting bonds issued to finance the majority of the facilitys initial construction cost. In addition, each owner has committed to a production support agreement, under which each owner has agreed to make
support obligation payments to Del-Tin Fiber to provide, on the occurrence of certain events, additional funds for payment of debt service until the plant is able to successfully complete a minimum production test. Both owners of Del-Tin Fiber have
also pledged their respective membership interest in the joint venture as collateral under the project financing agreement. Both have also agreed to fund any operating working capital needs until the facility is able to consistently generate
sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements.  These
contingent obligations were not reduced as a result of the Companys write-off of the carrying value of its investment in Del-Tin Fiber as of December 31, 2002. Due to the probable requirement for Deltic to advance to Del-Tin Fiber amounts
equal to its half of the facilitys 2003 quarterly sinking fund obligation, based on the plants 2003 cash flow projections at December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a current contingent liability, in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting
for Contingencies, to reflect this amount. This liability, in the amount of $4,478,000, was included in Deferred Revenues and Other Accrued Liabilities in the Companys 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet and paid during 2003. No additional
liability was estimated to be required for such payments after 2003 due to projected improvement in Del-Tin Fibers cash flows and to the Companys intent to have exited the business or to have refinanced the joint-ventures long-term
debt by the end of 2003. No such liability was recorded as of December 31, 2003. The maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required of the Company under current contractual guarantees is limited to the $17,500,000 committed under
the contingent equity agreement. However, with the Company currently funding its share of Del-Tin Fibers sinking fund contribution on a voluntary basis, potential future payments are estimated at approximately $31,210,000 if the Company is not
able to refinance the facilitys long-term debt by its scheduled maturity date. These payments consist of the Companys share of remaining sinking fund payments currently required of Del-Tin Fiber, including the $17,500,000 contingent
equity, but exclude any future operating working capital needs of Del-Tin Fiber for which an amount cannot be reasonably estimated due to recent improvements in the plants production ability.  Under the operating agreement, Del-Tin Fibers employees operate the
plant. Deltic has committed to provide a portion of the plants fiber and wood fuel supply at market prices. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, Deltic sold Del-Tin Fiber approximately $4,099,000, $3,018,000, and $1,924,000, respectively, of these
lumber manufacturing by-products. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had a receivable from Del-Tin Fiber of $78,000 and $85,000, respectively.

and 2002, the Companys share of the underlying net assets of Del-Tin Fiber exceeded its investment by $18,632,000 and $14,433,000, respectively. The excess relates primarily to the Companys write-off of its carrying amount for its
investment in Del-Tin Fiber as of December 31, 2002, and to interest received by the Company from Del-Tin Fiber prior to plant start-up, which was capitalized by Deltic as a reduction of its investment and was being amortized into income using the
straight-line method over a 60-month period. Del-Tin capitalized the interest paid to the Company into its property, plant, and equipment accounts, and it is being depreciated into the facilitys results of operations.  Prior to the 2002 write-off of its investment in Del-Tin Fiber, the Company
accounted for its investment in Del-Tin Fiber under the equity method. During 2003, the Company expensed amounts related to the funding of operating deficits. Effective December 11, 2003, as a result of the Companys intent to not sell its
investment in Del-Tin Fiber, Deltic resumed accounting for the investment using the equity method.

Accordingly, the investment in Del-Tin Fiber is carried at cost, adjusted for the Companys
proportionate share of undistributed earnings or losses. Cumulative net losses for the facility have amounted to $96,068,000, $48,034,000 net to the Company. As a result, no earnings have been available for distribution to the owners. Contributions
to Del-Tin Fiber by the Company as of December 31, 2003, have amounted to $62,437,000.  Note 5 Timber and Timberlands  Timber

Note 7 Credit Facilities  On September 30, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with SunTrust Bank and other domestic banks which provides an
unsecured, committed revolving credit facility totaling $125,000,000, inclusive of a $50,000,000 letter of credit feature. The agreement will expire July 15, 2007, and replaced the Companys former facility, which totaled $105,000,000, that was
scheduled to expire July 15, 2004. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, $80,000,000 and $59,000,000 was available in excess of all borrowings outstanding under or supported by the respective facilities. Borrowings under the current agreement bear
interest at a base rate or an adjusted Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, depending upon the type of loan the Company executes. The applicable margin component of the interest rate varies with the type of loan and the Companys total
debt to EBITDA ratio. Borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002, amounted to $45,000,000 and $46,000,000, respectively. Fees associated with the current revolving credit facility include a commitment fee of 25 to 4 percent per annum on
the unused portion of the committed amount. The agreement contains restrictive covenants, including a minimum consolidated net worth of the sum of $155,000,000, plus 50% of cumulative consolidated net income from July 1, 2003, and a maximum leverage
ratio of 6 to 1.  The Company may also borrow up to
$1,000,000 under a short-term credit facility with BancorpSouth. The agreement expires December 15, 2004, with renewal annually. The amount available to the Company under this facility is reduced by any borrowings by Deltic. As of December 31, 2003
and 2002, Deltic had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit, resulting in $1,000,000 available to the Company. Borrowings bear interest based upon the New York Prime. Deltic also has an agreement with BancorpSouth which provides a
$2,000,000 letter of credit facility. This agreement expires December 15, 2004, with renewal annually. Amounts available to the Company under the facility are reduced by any letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company. Outstanding letters of
credit as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, were $344,000 and $786,000, respectively, resulting in $1,656,000 and $1,214,000, respectively, available to Deltic. 
In addition, Deltic has an agreement with Regions Bank which provides a $1,000,000 letter of credit facility. The agreement is renewable annually.
Amounts available to Deltic under the facility are reduced by any letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company. Outstanding letters of credit totaled $480,000 as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, leaving $520,000 available to the
Company at the end of both years. For additional information regarding these financial instruments, see Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  Note 8 Indebtedness  The Companys indebtedness at December 31 consisted of the following:  Thousands of dollars

The $45,000,000 of notes payable designated as due in 2007 represents the outstanding balance under
the Companys revolving credit facility agreement with SunTrust Bank and a group of other domestic banks. The agreement will expire on July 15, 2007. The Company incurred costs of $476,000 related to the securing of this facility, which was
deferred and is being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the agreement.  During 1998, the Company successfully completed negotiation of the private placement of $40,000,000 of senior notes with Pacific Coast Farm Credit, a
division of American AgCredit. These unsecured notes have a fixed stated interest rate of 67 percent and mature on December 18, 2008. No installment payments are required, but the terms allow for prepayments at the option of the Company. The
agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of the sum of $135,000,000, plus 25 percent of cumulative consolidated adjusted net income from October 1, 1998, and a maximum funded
debt/capitalization ratio of 6 to 1. The Company incurred $226,000 of costs related to the issuance of these notes, which was deferred and is being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. In anticipation of
issuance of these notes, the Company entered into and settled an interest rate hedge contract. Upon settlement of this contract in December 1998, the Company paid $1,081,000, which was deferred and is being amortized as other debt expense over the
term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate for these notes of approximately 69 percent.  On December 20, 2002, Deltic successfully completed the private placement of $30,000,000 of senior notes with Metropolitan Life and a group of other
domestic insurance companies. These unsecured notes have a fixed stated interest rate of 601 percent and mature on December 20, 2012. Semiannual installments of $3,333,333, or such lesser amount as shall be outstanding, are required beginning on
December 20, 2008. The note terms allow for prepayment at the option of the Company in an amount of not less than five percent of the principal amount outstanding at the time of any prepayment. The agreement contains certain restrictive financial
covenants, including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of the sum of $148,299,000, plus 25 percent of cumulative consolidated adjusted net income from October 1, 2002, and a maximum consolidated debt to consolidated net capitalization ratio
of 6 to 1. The Company incurred $179,000 of costs related to the issuance of these notes, which was deferred and is being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the underlying debt.  The scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the next five years are
$64,000 in 2004, $32,000 in 2005, $24,000 in 2006, $45,000,000 in 2007, and $43,333,333 in 2008. For additional information regarding financial instruments, see Note 7 Credit Facilities and Note 12 Fair Value of Financial
Instruments.  Note 9 Redeemable Preferred Stock  During 1997, the Company issued 600,000 shares of its authorized preferred
stock having a par value of $01 per share. Redemption of these shares, designated by the Company as Cumulative Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock, 754% Series, was mandatory on December 31, 2002, and the Company redeemed these shares as required
utilizing proceeds from privately placed long term notes. These redeemable preferred shares had no voting rights, at any time, during the period for which they were outstanding.

Net long-term deferred tax liabilities were $12,559,000 at December 31, 2003, and $11,955,000 at
December 31, 2002. In addition, short-term deferred tax assets of $681,000 at December 31, 2003, and $685,000 at December 31, 2002, are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets for the respective
years.  As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had
valuation allowances of $2,911,000 and $2,142,000, respectively, to reduce its deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. The valuation allowances relate to the deferred tax assets arising from state tax loss carryforwards. The net changes
in the valuation allowances during 2003 and 2002 were increases of $769,000 and $1,185,000, respectively, and were principally due to the potential expiration of net operating losses for state tax purposes.  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, Deltics
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the Companys total deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company
will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, at December 31, 2003, as reductions of future taxable income or by utilizing available tax planning strategies. However, the amount of the net deferred tax assets
considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised.  At December 31, 2003, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes of approximately $87,299,000. Of this amount, $1,402,000 expires
in 2004, $34,162,000 expires in 2005, $21,696,000 expires in 2006, $23,817,000 expires in 2007, and $6,208,000 expires in 2008. An additional $14,000 will expire if not utilized as expected upon the filing of Deltics 2003 Arkansas state income
tax return. The Company had an expected federal tax refund of $1,556,000 at December 31, 2002, reflected in the 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Receivables; no such receivable existed as of December 31, 2003.  The Company was part of the consolidated income tax return of its former
parent, Murphy Oil Corporation Murphy Oil, for periods prior to its spin-off on January 1, 1997. Under the terms of a tax sharing agreement between the Company and Murphy Oil which governs tax matters for this period, Murphy Oil
personnel handle the administration of any tax disputes. During 2003, Murphy Oil closed the audit of its returns for 1992 -1994 and Deltic paid Murphy Oil $325,000 in additional taxes which resulted in additional deferred tax assets related to its
investment in real estate held for development and sale. Therefore, such settlement had no material impact on total income tax expense/benefit. With this settlement, all tax years under the tax sharing agreement are now closed, and the Company
anticipates no further adjustments relating to returns filed during those years. 
56 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2003 
Note 11 Stockholders Rights Plan  The Company has a Stockholders Rights Plan, which provides for each eligible common shareholder to receive a dividend of one
preferred stock purchase right Right for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock held. The Rights will expire on December 31, 2006, unless earlier exchanged or redeemed. The Rights will detach from the common stock
and become exercisable: 1 following a specified period of time after the date of the first public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons Acquiring Person, other than certain persons, has become the
beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock or 2 following a specified amount of time of the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by any Acquiring Person, other than certain persons, which would, if consummated,
result in such persons becoming the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock. In either case, the detachment of the Rights from the common stock is subject to extension by a majority of the directors of the Company.
The Rights have certain antitakeover effects and will cause substantial dilution to any Acquiring Person that attempts to acquire the Company without conditioning the offer on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. The Rights are not
intended to prevent a takeover, but rather are designed to enhance the ability of the Board of Directors of the Company to negotiate with an acquiror on behalf of all the shareholders. Other terms of the Rights are set forth in, and the foregoing
description is qualified in its entirety by, the Rights Agreement between the Company and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Rights Agent.  Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments held by the Company at December 31, 2003 and 2002.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The table excludes financial instruments included in current assets and liabilities, except the
current portion of noncurrent notes receivable and current maturities of long-term debt, all of which have fair values approximating carrying values.  2003 2002 Thousands of dollars

Letters of credit The fair value is based on the estimated cost to settle these obligations.  Note 13 Concentration of Credit Risks  Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to credit risk
are trade accounts receivable. These receivables normally arise from the sale of wood products and real estate. Concentration of credit with respect to these trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the
Companys customer base. No single customer accounted for a significant amount of the Companys sales of wood products or real estate in 2003, 2002, or 2001. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were no significant accounts receivable from
a single customer.  Note 14 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans
The Company has both funded and unfunded noncontributory
defined benefit retirement plans that cover the majority of its employees. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary. Deltic also has other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all of its
employees. The health care plan is contributory with participants contributions adjusted as needed; the life insurance plan is noncontributory. The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for its plans.  RetirementPlans OtherPostretirementBenefits Thousands of dollars

750 850 850 Rate of compensation increase
460 460 460  To develop the
expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset
classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the target asset association, to develop the expected long-term rate of
return on asset assumption for the portfolio. The returns were adjusted to account for plan expenses. This resulted in the selection of the 750% assumption. 
Retirement Plans The accumulated benefit obligations for the Companys retirement plans were $13,951,000 and $10,681,000 at December
31, 2003, and 2002, respectively. For the Companys qualified plan, the projected benefit obligation PBO exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $4,080,000 and $2,909,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively; however, the
fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation ABO at year-end by $237,000 and $1,525,000, respectively. Therefore, no recognition of a minimum pension liability was required for the qualified plan. The Company
does not fund its nonqualified plan; therefore, this plan has no assets. At year-end 2003 and 2002, the PBO for this nonqualified plan was $2,038,000 and $983,000, respectively. The Company recorded an actuarial determined liability, related to this
nonqualified plan, in the amount of $1,524,000 at December 31, 2003, and $710,000 at December 31, 2002, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Noncurrent Liabilities. As of December 31, 2003, the ABO for the nonqualified plan
exceeded the actuarial liability by $190,000. As a result, the Company has recorded the appropriate additional minimum pension liability for this amount, which is reflected in the 2003 Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other Noncurrent Liabilities.
The weighted average asset allocation for the Companys
qualified retirement plan at December 31, 2003 and 2002, by asset category, consisted of the following:  TargetAllocation 2003 2002 Equity securities
40-65 51 41 Debt securities
40-60 47 54 Cash equivalents
0-15 2 5 100 100  Equity securities
generally consist of common stocks. Investment in debt securities are limited to U.S. government securities, high quality corporate bonds, and mortgage-backed securities. Cash equivalents are limited to U.S. government obligations.

The primary investment goals are: 1 preservation of principle, 2 investment in a balanced
portfolio, and 3 growth of assets to exceed inflation. To meet these goals, the Companys Investment Committee has adopted the above target asset allocation ranges as outlined in the investment policy for the retirement plan. These ranges
allow for flexibility to meet investment goals without exposing the plans assets to excessive risk.  The current funding status of the qualified retirement plans is not expected to require the Company to make any contribution during 2004; however, Deltic
does expect to contribute $123,000 to fund benefits to be paid from its nonqualified retirement plan.  Other Postretirement Benefits The Company sponsors a plan that provides comprehensive health care benefits supplementing Medicare benefits
for those eligible and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Costs are accrued for this plan during the service lives of covered employees. Retirees contribute a portion of the self-funded cost of health care benefits; the Company
contributes the remainder. The Company pays premiums for life insurance coverage, arranged through an insurance company. The health care plan is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Company retains the right to modify or terminate the benefits
and/or cost sharing provisions. Deltic expects to contribute $358,000 to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2004.  In determining the benefit obligation for health care at December 31, 2003, health care inflation cost was assumed to increase at an annual rate of ten
percent in 2003, decreasing one percent per year to five percent in 2008 and thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one percentage-point increase in the assumed
health care cost trend would increase the aggregate service and interest cost components of periodic benefit cost for 2003 by $92,000 and the benefit obligation by $798,000, while a one percentage-point decrease in the assumed rate would decrease
the 2003 cost components by $82,000 and the benefit obligation by $734,000.  Thrift Plan Employees of the Company may participate in its thrift plan by allotting up to a specific percentage of their base pay. The Company matches contributions at a stated percentage of each
employees allotment, based on length of participation in the plan. Company contributions to this plan were $311,000 in 2003, $290,000 in 2002, and $275,000 in 2001.  Note 15 Incentive Plans  Stock Incentive Plan  On April 25, 2002, the Companys shareholders approved the Deltic Timber Corporation 2002 Stock Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan. The 2002
Plan replaced the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan, which was terminated. At December 31, 2003, remaining outstanding options under the 1996 Plan totaled 263,947 shares, of which 208,847 shares were exercisable. No further
awards will be made under the 1996 Plan, and the unexercisable outstanding options will be fully vested by the end of the first quarter of 2004. Outstanding options under the 1996 Plan will expire from 2006 to 2011 if not exercised and have an
average exercise price of $2466 based on the fair market value at date of grant.

The 2002 Plan permits annual awards of shares of the Companys common stock to executives, other
key employees, and directors. Under the plan, the Executive Compensation Committee the Committee is authorized to grant: 1 stock options; 2 restricted stock and restricted stock units; 3 performance units; and 4 other
stock-based awards, including stock appreciation rights and rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. The number of shares available for issuance under the 2002 Plan is 1,800,000 shares unless adjustment is determined necessary by the Committee
as the result of dividend or other distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of common stock, or other corporate transaction in
order to prevent dilution or enlargement of benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available. At December 31, 2003, 1,510,875 of these 1,800,000 shares were available for award under the 2002 Plan. No participant in the 2002 Plan may
receive options and stock appreciation rights in any calendar year that relates to more than 50,000 shares, and the maximum number of shares which may be awarded as restricted stock and restricted stock units or other stock-based awards is 180,000
shares. The Company applies the intrinsic value method of APB 25 to account for stock-based compensation, accruing costs of any stock options and restricted stock over the respective vesting/performance periods. The cost of stock-based compensation
is reflected in General and Administrative Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and amounted to $339,000 in 2003, $664,000 in 2002, and $618,000 in 2001. For additional information regarding the Companys stock-based compensation,
including the effect on net income/loss and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies.  Stock Options For each option granted under the 2002 Plan, the
Committee fixes the option price at not less than fair market value on the date of the grant and the option term, not to exceed 10 years from date of grant. Options granted in 2002 were awarded in February 2002 subject to shareholder approval in
April. As a result of an increase in the market value of the Companys common stock from the grant date to the approval date, these options have an intrinsic value of $346 per share. The resulting fixed stocked-based compensation cost is being
accrued over the vesting period for these options. Replacement options granted due to the spin-off from Murphy Oil were for ten years from original grant date and nonqualified. New options granted in 1997 and 1998 were for ten years and primarily
incentive. Options granted since 1998 have been for ten years and nonqualified. All options have an option price not less than the market value on the grant date, with a range in option prices of $990 to $29295 per share. For options granted in
1997, exclusive of replacement options, half could be exercised or surrendered after two years and the remainder after three years. For options granted from 1998 through 2001, half could be exercised or surrendered after one year and the remainder
after three years. During 2002 and 2003, the Company granted options for 162,250 shares and 129,750 shares, respectively. For 122,250 shares and 121,750 shares granted in 2002 and 2003, respectively, half may be exercised or surrendered after one
year and the remainder after three years, and the remaining 40,000 shares and 8,000 shares, respectively, awarded to nonemployee directors at an option price of $29295 in 2002 and $2431 in 2003, were vested immediately when awarded.

Note 19 Business Segments  The Companys four reporting segments consist of Deltics three operating business units and its corporate
function. Each reporting entity has a separate management team and infrastructure that offers different products and/or services.  Woodlands operations manage the Companys Southern Pine timberlands located primarily in Arkansas and north Louisiana and derive revenue from the
harvest of timber from the timberlands, in accordance with its harvest plans, and either sells timber to third parties in the domestic market or to the Companys Mills segment for conversion into lumber. In addition, this segment may, from time
to time, identify and sell a portion of its timberland holdings that is either non-strategic to future timberland management activities or has appreciated, due primarily to location, to a level that exceeds its value as a timber-growing asset. This
segment also generates revenue from the leasing of hunting, oil and gas, and other rights on its timberlands.  The Mills segment consists of Deltics two sawmills which convert timber, purchased from third parties or the Companys Woodlands segment, into
lumber. These mills produce a variety of products, including dimension lumber, boards, timbers, decking, and secondary manufacturing products, such as finger-jointed studs. These products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors, lumber
treaters, and truss manufacturers in the South and Midwest and used in residential construction, roof trusses and laminated beams.  Real Estate operations, which currently include three separate real estate developments, add value to former timberland by developing it into upscale,
planned residential and commercial developments. These developments, each of which is centered around a core amenity, are being developed in stages. To-date, real estate sales have consisted primarily of residential lots sold to builders or
individuals, commercial site sales, and sales of undeveloped acreage. In addition, this segment currently leases retail and office space to third parties in a retail center constructed by the Company, and held for sale, in one of its developments.
This segment also manages: 1 a real estate brokerage subsidiary which currently generates commission revenue by reselling existing homesites in one of the Company developments and 2 a country club operation, Chenal Country Club, Inc., around
which the Companys Chenal Valley development is centered. This club operation derives its revenues from membership services, food and beverage sales, and membership dues.  Corporate operations consist primarily of senior management, planning, accounting, information systems, human resources,
treasury, income tax, and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units. The Company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units.  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on operating income before results of Del-Tin Fiber, an equity method investee; interest income and expense; other nonoperating
income or expense; and income taxes. Intersegment revenues consist primarily of timber sales from the Woodlands segment to the Mills operations.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT  The Shareholders Deltic Timber Corporation:
The management of Deltic Timber Corporation has prepared and is responsible
for the Companys consolidated financial statements. The statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, appropriate in the circumstances. In preparing the financial
statements, management has, when necessary, made judgments and estimates with consideration given to materiality.  The Company has established and maintains a disclosure control system and related policies and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known. In addition, the Company maintains internal control systems and related policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss or
unauthorized use, that the accounting records accurately reflect business transactions, and that the transactions are in accordance with managements authorization. The design, monitoring, and revision of the systems of internal control
involve, among other things, our judgment with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. The Company also maintains an internal auditing function which monitors the effectiveness of the controls, while
independently and systematically evaluating and formally reporting on the adequacy and effectiveness of components of the system.  The Companys consolidated financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, independent certified public accountants, who have expressed their opinion with
respect to the fairness of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Their audit was conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
include the consideration of the Companys internal controls to the extent necessary to form an independent opinion on the consolidated financial statements prepared by management. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the Audit
Committee appoints the independent auditors; ratification of the appointment is solicited annually from the shareholders.  The Audit Committee is composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the Company and who have been determined by the Companys Board of Directors to
meet applicable independence standards under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the certified public accountants, the Companys internal auditor, and representatives of management to review the
Companys internal controls, the quality of its financial reporting, the scope and results of audits, and the independence of the external auditors. The Companys internal auditor and KPMG LLP have unrestricted access to the Audit
Committee, without managements presence, to discuss audit findings and other financial matters.  /s/ Clefton D. Vaughan  Clefton D. Vaughan

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT  The Board
of Directors Deltic Timber Corporation:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deltic Timber Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003. The consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Deltic Timber Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  /s/ KPMG LLP  KPMG LLP Shreveport, Louisiana February 6, 2004

Controls and Procedures.  Deltic Timber Corporation the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls

that the required information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms.  There were no significant changes during the quarter in internal controls over financial reporting or in any other factors
that could significantly affect those internal controls. The Company has not identified any significant deficiency or material weakness in its internal controls, and therefore, no corrective actions were taken.
