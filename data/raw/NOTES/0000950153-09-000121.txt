Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Organization
and Nature of Operations   P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. the Company
operates two restaurant concepts consisting of restaurants
throughout the United States under the names P.F. Changs
China Bistro Bistro and Pei Wei Asian Diner
Pei Wei. The Company was formed in 1996 and became
publicly traded in 1998.   Fiscal
Year   The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to the
end of December. Fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 were each
comprised of 52weeks.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting
principles GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Principles
of Consolidation and Presentation   The Companys consolidated financial statements include the
accounts and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and
partnerships in which it owns more than a 50percent
interest. All material balances and transactions between the
consolidated entities have been eliminated. Minority interest is
recorded as a reduction of the reported income or expense unless
the amount would result in a reduction of expense for which the
minority partner would not be responsible.   Reclassification   Certain amounts shown in the prior periods consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
current year consolidated financial statement presentation.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   The Companys cash and cash equivalent balances are not
pledged or restricted. The Companys policy is to invest
cash in excess of operating requirements in income-producing
investments. Income-producing investments with maturities of
three months or less at the time of investment are reflected as
cash equivalents. Amounts receivable from credit card processors
are also considered cash equivalents because they are both
short-term and highly liquid in nature and are typically
converted to cash within three days of the sales transaction.
Cash equivalents as of December28, 2008 and
December30, 2007 consisted primarily of overnight money
market fund investments and amounts receivable from credit card
processors.   Receivables   Receivables, which the Company classifies within other current
assets, consist primarily of amounts due from landlords or other
parties for tenant incentives and amounts due from third-party
gift card sales. Management believes these amounts to be
collectible.   Inventories   Inventories consist of food and beverages and are stated at the
lower of cost or market using the
first-in,
first-out method.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   Property
and Equipment   Property and equipment is stated at cost, which includes
capitalized interest during the construction and development
period. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful service lives of
the related assets, which approximate seven years. The
Companys home office building is depreciated on a
straight-line basis over 30years, and building
improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over
20years. Leasehold improvements and buildings under
capital lease are amortized over the shorter of the useful life
of the asset or the length of the related lease term. The term
of the lease includes renewal option periods only in instances
in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably
assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an
economic penalty. China and smallwares are generally depreciated
over two years up to 50percent of their original cost and
replacements are recorded as operating expenses as they are
purchased.   Depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation
and amortization of fixed assets, gains and losses on disposal
of assets and the amortization of intangible assets,
non-transferable liquor license fees and capitalized software
costs. Depreciation and amortization expense included in
continuing operations associated with property and equipment,
including property under capital leases, totaled
$655million, $533million, and $424million
for the years ended December28, 2008, December30,
2007, and December31, 2006, respectively.   During the years ended December28, 2008, December30,
2007, and December31, 2006, the Company incurred gross
interest expense of $48million, $25million, and
$10million, respectively. $07million,
$18million, and $10million, respectively, of these
interest costs were capitalized during the years ended
December28, 2008, December30, 2007, and
December31, 2006.   The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment when
events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired,
but at least quarterly. The Company tests impairment using
historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances
as the primary basis for an estimate of future cash flows. The
analysis is performed at the individual restaurant or operating
segment level for indicators of permanent impairment.   During the year-ended December28, 2008, the Company
recognized non-cash asset impairment charges of
$75million $46million net of tax related to the
write-off of the carrying value of the long-lived assets
associated with the closure of 10 Pei Wei stores. During the
year-ended December30, 2007, the Company recognized an
asset impairment charge of $31million $21million
net of tax related to the write-off of the carrying value of
the long-lived assets of Taneko associated with the fiscal 2008
asset sale. See Note2 for further discussion. No other
impairment of long-lived assets was recognized by the Company
during the years ended December28, 2008 and
December30, 2007. There can be no assurance that future
impairment tests will not result in additional charges to
earnings.   Goodwill
and Intangible Assets   Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment
tests. Intangible assets deemed to have definite lives are
amortized over their estimated useful lives.   Goodwill   Goodwill represents the residual purchase price after allocation
of the purchase price of assets acquired and relates to the
Companys purchase of interests in various restaurants at
the formation of the Company. Impairment tests are performed
with respect to goodwill at the segment level of reporting. On
an annual basis, the Company reviews the recoverability of
goodwill based primarily on a multiple of earnings analysis
comparing the fair value of the reporting segment to the
carrying value. As a secondary review, the Company also compares
the market value of its common stock to the total Company
carrying value. Generally, the Company performs its annual
assessment for impairment during the fourth quarter of its
fiscal year and performs the analysis more frequently if there
are any impairment indicators identified during the year. As of
December28, 2008, management determined there was no

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   impairment of goodwill. There can be no assurance that future
goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to
earnings.   Intangible
Assets   Intangible assets consist of the excess of the purchase price at
the time the Company repurchases a partners minority
interest over the imputed fair value of that interest at the
time of the original investment. These assets are amortized over
their useful lives, which is generally 15years for Bistro
restaurants and 10years for Pei Wei restaurants.   The Company reviews intangible assets with definite lives those
assets resulting from the acquisition of minority partners
interests in the operating rights of certain of our restaurants
for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these
assets might be impaired, but at least quarterly. The Company
tests impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant
facts and circumstances as the primary basis for an estimate of
future cash flows. The analysis is performed at the restaurant
level for indicators of impairment. As of December28,
2008, management has determined that there was no impairment of
intangible assets. There can be no assurance that future
intangible assets impairment tests will not result in a charge
to earnings.   Other
Assets   Other assets consist primarily of transferable and
nontransferable liquor licenses, capitalized software costs,
vendor deposits, deferred compensation plan assets and deferred
financing costs. During 2008, the Company recorded additional
assets related to capitalized software, liquor licenses for new
restaurants and its deferred compensation plan see Note11
for additional information.   Accrued
Insurance   The Company is self-insured for certain exposures, principally
medical and dental, general liability and workers
compensation, for the first $100,000, $250,000 or $500,000 of
individual claims, depending on the type of claim. The Company
has paid amounts to its insurance carrier that approximate the
cost of claims known to date and has accrued additional
liabilities for its estimate of ultimate costs related to those
claims. In developing these estimates, the Company and its
insurance providers use historical experience factors to
estimate the ultimate claim exposure. The Companys self
insurance liabilities are actuarially determined and consider
estimates of expected losses, based on statistical analyses of
the Companys actual historical trends as well as
historical industry data. It is reasonably possible that future
adjustments to these estimates will be required. Management
believes the Company has provided adequate reserves for its
self-insured exposure.   Lease
Obligations   The Company leases all of its restaurant properties. At the
inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine
whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or
capital lease. The term of the lease used for this evaluation
includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the
exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and
failure to exercise such option would result in an economic
penalty.   The Company accounts for tenant incentives received from its
landlords in connection with certain of its operating leases as
a deferred rent liability within lease obligations and amortizes
such amounts over the relevant lease term. For leases that
contain rent escalations, the Company records the total rent
payable during the lease term, as determined above, on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease including the
rent holiday period beginning upon possession of the
premises, and records the difference between the minimum rents
paid and the straight-line rent as a lease obligation.

Continued   Certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental
payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent
rent. Contingent rent is accrued each period as the
liability is incurred, in addition to the straight-line rent
expense noted above.   Other
Liabilities   Other liabilities include the Companys conditional asset
retirement obligations ARO recognized under
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Interpretation No47 FIN47,
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.
The Companys ARO liabilities are primarily associated
with certain of the Companys restaurant leases under which
the landlord has the option to require, at a future date, the
Company to remove its leasehold improvements at the end of the
lease term and return the property to the landlord in its
original condition. The Company estimates the fair value of
these liabilities based on estimated store closing costs,
accretes that current cost forward to the date of estimated ARO
removal and discounts the future cost back as if it were
performed at the inception of the lease. At the inception of
such a lease, the Company records the ARO liability and also
records a related capital asset in an amount equal to the
estimated fair value of the liability. The ARO liability is
accreted to its future value, with accretion expense recognized
as interest and other income, net, and the capitalized asset is
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the
asset, which is generally the life of the leasehold improvement.
The estimate of the conditional asset retirement liability is
based on a number of assumptions requiring managements
judgment, including store closing costs, inflation rates and
discount rates. As a result, in future periods the Company may
make adjustments to the ARO liability as a result of the
availability of new information, changes in estimated costs and
other factors.   Other liabilities also include the Companys net long-term
deferred tax liabilities, liabilities related to the
Companys deferred compensation plans discussed further in
Note11and a derivative liability discussed further
in this footnote and Note7.   Unearned
Revenue   The Company sells gift cards to customers in its restaurants,
through its websites and via other retail outlets. Unearned
revenue represents gift cards sold for which revenue recognition
criteria, generally redemption, has not been met. These amounts
are presented net of any discounts issued by the Company in
connection with the terms of its third-party gift card
distribution agreements.   Revenue
Recognition   Revenues from food, beverage and alcohol sales are recognized as
products are sold.   The Company recognizes income from gift cards when: ithe
gift card is redeemed by the customer; or iithe
likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is
remote gift card breakage and the Company determines there is
no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards
to the relevant jurisdictions. The Company determines the gift
card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns.
Gift card breakage income was not significant in any fiscal year
and is reported within Revenues in the consolidated statements
of income.   Advertising   The Company expenses advertising production costs at the time
the advertising first takes place. All other advertising costs
are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense for the years
ended December28, 2008, December30, 2007, and
December31, 2006 was $92million, $55million,
and $35million, respectively.

Continued   Partner
Bonus Expense, Imputed   Partner bonus expense, imputed, which is classified within labor
expense on the consolidated statements of income, represents the
portion of restaurant level operating results that is allocable
to minority partners, but which is presented as bonus expense
for accounting purposes. Specifically, given that employees who
choose to invest as partners are not eligible to participate in
restaurant-level bonus programs, a portion of their partnership
earnings that would otherwise be presented as minority interest
expense is deemed to be a bonus expense for financial reporting
purposes. The amounts imputed are based on existing bonus
programs used by the Company for non-investing employees based
on individual restaurant level-operating results. Partner bonus
expense, imputed for the years ended December28, 2008,
December30, 2007, and December31, 2006 was
$09million, $14million, and $20million,
respectively.   Preopening
Expense   Preopening expense, consisting primarily of manager salaries and
relocation expense, employee payroll and related training costs
incurred prior to the opening of a restaurant, is expensed as
incurred. Preopening expense also includes the accrual for
straight-line rent recorded for the period between date of
possession and the restaurant opening date for the
Companys leased restaurant locations.   Partner
Investment Expense   Partner investment expense generally represents the difference
between the imputed fair value of partners ownership
interests at the time the partners invest in their restaurants
and the partners cash capital contribution for these
ownership interests. Additionally, for those partners who are
bought out prior to the end of a specific term generally five
years, partner investment expense includes a reversal of
previously recognized expense for the difference between the
fair value of the partners interest at inception date and
the fair value at the date of repurchase, to the extent that the
former is greater.   Consolidated partner investment expense for the years ended
December28, 2008 and December30, 2007 was a net
benefit of $04million and $20million,
respectively. Partner investment expense at the Bistro for the
years ended December28, 2008 and December30, 2007
was a $11million and $34million benefit,
respectively, due to the change in the Bistro partnership
structure discussed in Note13, which led to a significant
increase in buyouts of minority partner interests during fiscal
2008 and fiscal 2007. These buyouts resulted in the reversal of
a portion of previously recognized partner investment expense,
due to the fair value of the partners interest at
inception date exceeding the fair value of the partners
interest at repurchase date. Additionally, as a result of the
change in partnership structure at the Bistro beginning in
fiscal 2007, partner investment expense is no longer recognized
at the time a new Bistro restaurant opens.   Taxes   The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for
income taxes as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are
determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted
tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. Recognition of deferred tax assets is
limited to amounts considered by management to be more likely
than not of realization in future periods.   The Company adopted the provisions of FIN48 on
January1, 2007. As a result of the implementation, the
Company recognized no material adjustment to the liability for
unrecognized income tax benefits that existed as of
December31, 2006. It is the Companys policy to
recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
positions as a component of income tax expense. See Note14
for additional information regarding the change in unrecognized
tax benefits.

Value of Financial Instruments   The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, investments,
receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses is deemed to
approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. The fair value of
long-term debt approximates the carrying value due to the
Companys right to repay outstanding balances at any time.   Concentrations
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
cash investments and receivables. The Company maintains cash and
cash equivalents, funds on deposit and certain other financial
instruments with financial institutions that are considered in
the Companys investment strategy. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to receivables are limited as the
Companys receivables are primarily with its landlords,
related to tenant incentives.   Derivatives   All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair
value as either assets or liabilities. The fair value of the
Companys derivative financial instruments is determined
using either market quotes or valuation models that are based
upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and
incorporate current market data inputs. The Company reports its
derivative assets or liabilities in other assets or other
liabilities, as applicable. The accounting for the change in the
fair value of a derivative financial instrument depends on its
intended use and the resulting hedge designation, if any, as
discussed below.   A cash flow hedge is a derivative designed to hedge the exposure
of variable future cash flows that is attributable to a
particular risk associated with an existing recognized asset or
liability, or a forecasted transaction. The Company utilizes the
hypothetical derivative method, as defined in
SFASNo133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities to measure hedge effectiveness. For
derivative financial instruments that qualify as cash flow
hedges, the effective portions of the gain or loss on the
derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
loss income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged
cash flows are recognized into earnings. The amount that is
reclassified into earnings, as well as any ineffective portion
of the gain or loss, as

component of interest and other income expense. If a hedge is
de-designated or terminated prior to maturity, the amount
previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss
income is recognized into earnings over the period that the
hedged item impacts earnings. If a hedge relationship is
discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted
transaction will not occur according to the original strategy,
any related amounts previously recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss income are recognized into earnings
immediately. There was no hedge ineffectiveness recognized
during the period ended December28, 2008.   During the second quarter of 2008, the Company hedged a portion
of its existing long-term variable-rate debt through the use of
an interest rate swap. This derivative instrument effectively
fixes the interest expense on a portion of the Companys
long-term debt for the duration of the swap. See Note7 for
further discussion of the Companys interest rate swap.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position
FSP
No.FAS157-3,
Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
Market for That Asset Is Not Active, which clarifies the
application of Statement No157 in an inactive market and
illustrates how an entity would determine fair value when the
market for a financial asset is not active. The Staff Position
is effective immediately and applies to prior periods for which
financial statements have not been issued, including interim or
annual periods ending on or before December30, 2008. The
implementation of
FAS157-3
did not have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.   In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP
FAS142-3,
Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets
FSP142-3.
FSP142-3
amends the factors that should be considered in developing
renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
life of a recognized intangible asset under
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS142. This change is
intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a
recognized intangible asset under SFAS142 and the period
of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the
asset under SFAS141R and other GAAP. The requirement for
determining useful lives must be applied prospectively to
intangible assets acquired after the effective date and the
disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all
intangible assets recognized as of, and subsequent to, the
effective date.
FSP142-3
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2008, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, which will require the Company to
adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and
will apply prospectively
FSP142-3
on its consolidated financial statements.   In March 2008, the FASB issued SFASNo161,
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, SFAS161. SFAS161
requires companies to provide enhanced disclosures about
derivative instruments and hedging activities to enable
investors to better understand the effects of such instruments
and activities on a companys financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. Under SFAS161, companies are
required to disclose the fair values of derivative instruments
and their gains and losses in a tabular format. SFAS161 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November15,
2008, and the Company will adopt these provisions in the first
quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company does not anticipate that the
adoption of SFAS161 will have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo141
revised 2007, Business Combinations
SFAS141R. SFAS141R establishes
principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business
combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements
the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and
any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition
date. SFAS141R significantly changes the accounting for
business combinations in a number of areas including the
treatment of contingent consideration, preacquisition
contingencies, transaction costs, in-process research and
development and restructuring costs. In addition, under
SFAS141R, changes in an acquired entitys deferred
tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the measurement
period will impact income tax expense. SFAS141R provides
guidance regarding what information to disclose to enable users
of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
effects of the business combination.

Continued   SFAS141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2008 with early application prohibited. The
Company will adopt SFAS141R beginning in the first quarter
of fiscal 2009 and will change its accounting treatment for
business combinations on a prospective basis.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements, an amendment of ARB No51
SFAS160. SFAS160 changes the
accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
component of equity. This new consolidation method significantly
changes the accounting for transactions with minority interest
holders. SFAS160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2008 with early application prohibited.
As a result of adopting SFAS160, beginning in fiscal 2009
the Company will no longer record an intangible asset when the
purchase price of a partnership interest exceeds the book value
at the time of buyout. Instead, any excess will be recorded as a
reduction to equity. Additionally, after the adoption of
SFAS160, operating losses will be allocated to
noncontrolling interests even when such allocation results in a
deficit balance i.e., book value can go negative. The Company
will present noncontrolling interests currently shown as
minority interest as a component of equity on the consolidated
balance sheets and minority interest expense will no longer be
separately reported as a reduction to net income on the
consolidated income statements. The Company does not anticipate
the adoption of SFAS160 to have any other material impact
on its consolidated financial statements.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements SFAS157.
SFAS157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure
assets and liabilities. The standard establishes a common
definition for fair value to be applied to U.S.GAAP
requiring the use of fair value establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about such
fair value measurements. SFAS157 is effective for fiscal

Staff Position
FAS157-2
Effective Date of FASB Statement No157 delayed the
effective date of SFAS157 for most nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2008. The implementation of SFAS157 for
financial assets and financial liabilities, effective
December31, 2007, did not have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company
will adopt SFAS157 for nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal 2009 and does not expect adoption to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements.   SFAS157 established a three-level hierarchy of valuation
techniques used to measure fair value, defined as follows   
Unadjusted Quoted Prices The fair value of an asset
or liability is based on unadjusted quoted prices, in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. An example would be
a marketable equity security that is actively traded on the New
York Stock Exchange. Level1   
Pricing Models with Significant Observable Inputs
The fair value of an asset or liability is based on information
derived from either an active market quoted price, which may
require further adjustment based on the attributes of the
financial asset or liability being measured, or an inactive
market transaction. Examples of such instruments would include
ia quoted price for an actively traded equity investment
that is adjusted for a contractual trading restriction, or
iithe fair value derived from a trade of an identical or
similar security in an inactive market. Level2   
Pricing Models with Significant Unobservable Inputs
The fair value of an asset or liability is primarily based on
internally derived assumptions surrounding the timing and amount
of expected cash flows for the financial instrument. Therefore,
these assumptions are unobservable in either an active or
inactive market. An example would be the retained interest in a
securitization trust. Level3

equivalents balance per the consolidated balance sheet at
December28, 2008 due to the offset of certain money market
fund investments with book overdrafts in operating cash accounts
at the same financial institution under legal right of offset
agreements. As of December28, 2008, $228million of
the Companys money market investments were guaranteed by
the federal government under the Treasury Temporary Guarantee
Program for Money Market Funds. This program expires on
April30, 2009. Other money market investments held by the
Company were invested primarily in government backed securities
at December28, 2008.   The Companys 401k Restoration Plan the
Restoration Plan investments are considered trading
securities and are reported at fair value based on third party
broker statements. The realized and unrealized holding gains and
losses related to these investments, as well as the offsetting
compensation expense, is recorded in operating income. See
Note11 for further discussion of the Companys
Restoration Plan.   The fair value of the Companys interest rate swap is
estimated using net present value of a series of cash flows on
both the fixed and floating legs of the swap. These cash flows
are based on yield curves which take into account the
contractual terms of the derivative, including the period to
maturity and market-based parameters such as interest rates and
volatility. The yield curves used in the valuation model are
based on published data for counterparties with an AA rating.
Market practice in pricing derivatives initially assumes all
counterparties have the same credit quality. The Company
mitigates derivative credit risk by transacting with highly
rated counterparties. Management has evaluated the credit and
nonperformance risks associated with its derivative counterparty
and believes them to be insignificant and not warranting a
credit adjustment at December28, 2008. See Note7 for
a discussion of the Companys interest rate swap.

quarter of 2008, was the result of a rigorous evaluation of the
Companys entire store portfolio. The Company reviewed each
locations past and present operating performance combined
with projected future results. The restaurants selected for
closure had lower profitability and were not projected to
provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future.   During the second half of 2008, the Company recognized non-cash
asset impairment charges of $75million $46million
net of tax related to the write-off of the carrying value of

termination agreements with each of the closed Pei Wei
restaurants landlords. A lease termination agreement for
one of the ten locations had been executed as of
December28, 2008. Lease termination agreements for two
additional locations have been executed as of the date of this
Form10-K.   Goodwill allocated to the Pei Wei concept totaled
$03million. The Company did not record any impairment to
Pei Wei goodwill related to the fiscal 2008 store closures.   In accordance with SFAS144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, the Company
determined that each individual Pei Wei restaurant represents a
component of an entity since each store has separately
identifiable operations and cash flows. Each restaurant is
therefore considered a reporting unit in accordance with
SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The
ten closed restaurants were not in close proximity to other Pei
Wei restaurants and the Company does not anticipate having
significant ongoing cash inflows or outflows related to these
operations subsequent to closure and lease termination. As a
result, the Company determined that the Pei Wei restaurant
closures met the criteria for classification as discontinued
operations in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. As a result, all historical operating results as
well as asset impairment, lease termination and severance
charges related to the closed stores are reflected within
discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements
for all periods presented.   Taneko   The Company opened its Taneko Japanese Tavern
Taneko restaurant on October1, 2006 in
Scottsdale, Arizona. As a result of the operating losses
realized by Taneko and managements increased focus on the

Credit
Facility   On August31, 2007, the Company entered into a senior
credit facility Credit Facility with several
commercial financial institutions, which allows for borrowings
of up to $1500million. The Credit Facility expires on
August30, 2013 and contains customary representations,
warranties, negative and affirmative covenants, including a
requirement to maintain a maximum leverage ratio, as defined, of
25:1 and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined, of
125:1, as well as customary events of default and certain
default provisions that could result in acceleration of the
Credit Facility. The Company was in compliance with these
restrictions and conditions as of December28, 2008 as the
Companys leverage ratio was 179:1 and the fixed charge
coverage ratio was 208:1.   The Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Companys material
existing and future domestic subsidiaries. As of
December28, 2008, the Company had borrowings outstanding
under the Credit Facility totaling $800million as well as
$113million committed for the issuance of letters of
credit, which is required by insurance companies for the
Companys workers compensation and general liability
insurance programs. Available borrowings under the Credit
Facility were $587million at December28, 2008.   Interest
Rate Swap   During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company entered
into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of
$400million. The purpose of this transaction is to
provide a hedge against the effects of changes in interest rates
on a portion of the Companys current variable rate
borrowings. The Company has designated the interest rate swap as
a cash flow hedge of its exposure to variability in future cash
flows attributable to interest payments on a $400million
tranche of floating rate debt.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   Under the terms of the interest rate swap, the Company pays a
fixed rate of 332% on the $400million notional amount
and receives payments from its counterparty based on the
1-month
LIBOR rate for a term ending on May20, 2010, effectively
resulting in a fixed rate on the LIBOR component of the
$400million notional amount. Interest rate differentials
paid or received under the swap agreement are recognized as
adjustments to interest expense.   At December28, 2008, the recorded fair value of the
interest rate swap was a liability balance of $12million
$08million net of tax. The liability is reported within
other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and is
offset by a corresponding amount in stockholders equity,
representing the net unrealized losses included in accumulated
other comprehensive loss. At December28, 2008, accumulated
other comprehensive loss, as reflected in common
stockholders equity, consisted of unrealized losses on
derivatives totaling $08million, net of tax.

concurrent 24month offering periods. Each offering period
is divided into four consecutive six-month purchase periods. The
price at which stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan was
initially equal to 85percent of the lower of the fair
market value of the common stock on the first day of the
offering period and the fair market value of the common stock on
the last day of the offering period. In accordance with the
adoption of SFAS123R on January2, 2006, the Company
began recognizing share-based compensation expense for its
Purchase Plan, which totaled $02million and
$05million, respectively, for the years ended
December30, 2007 and December31, 2006.

Continued   In August 2007, the Company modified the terms of its Purchase
Plan such that the price at which stock is purchased is equal to
95percent of the fair market value of the common stock on
the last day of the offering period. As a result of this change,
the Companys Purchase Plan is no longer considered to be
compensatory and therefore, the Company ceased recognizing
share-based compensation expense associated with the Purchase
Plan in August 2007.   Share
Repurchase Program   Since inception, the Companys Board of Directors
authorized programs to repurchase up to a total of
$1500million of the Companys outstanding shares of
common stock from time to time in the open market or in private
transactions at prevailing market prices. The Company
repurchased a total of 32million shares of its common
stock for $964million at an average price of $2974 for
the years ended December30, 2007 and December31,
2006 and $36million of the initial $500million
purchase authorization expired in fiscal 2007.   For the year ended December28, 2008, the Company
repurchased a total of 04million shares of its common
stock for $100million at an average price of $2538 using
cash on hand. At December28, 2008, there remains
$400million available under the current share repurchase
authorization, which expires in July 2009.

Benefit
Plans   401k
Plan   Effective July1, 1997, the Company adopted a 401k
Defined Contribution Benefit Plan the Plan, which
covers substantially all employees of the Company that have
completed one year of service and have attained the age of
21years old. The Plan permits participants to contribute
to the Plan, subject to Internal Revenue Code restrictions, and
also permits the Company to make discretionary matching
contributions. For the year ended December31, 2006, the
Company did not make any contributions to the Plan. Beginning
July1, 2007, the Company began bi-weekly matching
contributions in amounts equal to 25% of the first 6% of
employee compensation contributed, resulting in a maximum
contribution of 15% of participating employee compensation per
year subject to annual dollar maximum limits. Company
contributions to the Plan vest at the rate of 20% each year
beginning after the employees first year of service. For
the years ended December28, 2008 and December30,
2007, the Companys matching contribution expense under the
Plan was $06million and $03million, respectively.   401k
Restoration Plan   Effective July1, 2007, the Company adopted a 401k
Restoration Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
which allows officers and highly compensated employees to defer
receipt of a portion of their compensation and contribute such
amounts to one or more investment funds. The maximum aggregate
amount deferrable under the Restoration Plan is 75% of base
salary and 100% of cash incentive compensation. The Company
makes bi-weekly matching contributions in an amount equal to 25%
of the first 6% of employee compensation contributed, with a
maximum annual Company contribution of 15% of employee
compensation per year subject to annual dollar maximum limits.
Company contributions to the Restoration Plan vest at the rate
of 20% each year beginning after the employees first year
of service. For the years ended December28, 2008 and
December30, 2007, the Companys matching contribution
expense under the Restoration Plan was $02million and
$01million, respectively.   Additionally, the Company entered into a rabbi trust agreement
to protect the assets of the Restoration Plan. Each
participants account is comprised of their contribution,
the Companys matching contribution and their share of
earnings or losses in the Restoration Plan. In accordance with
EITF
No97-14,
Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where
Amounts Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested, the accounts
of the rabbi trust are reported in the Companys

investments within other assets and the related obligation

amounts totaled $12million and $06million at
December28, 2008 and December30, 2007, respectively.

Employment
Agreements   The Company has executed employment agreements with the
following executive officers: Chief Executive Officer, President
Co-Chief Executive Officer, effective January5, 2009,
Executive Vice-President, Global Brand Development and Chief
Financial Officer. The term for the current agreements is three
years and the agreements prohibit these officers from competing
with P.F. Changs China Bistro and Pei Wei Asian Diner in
the area of Chinese and Asian food concepts during the term of
the agreements and for one year after termination. The
agreements provide for immediate vesting of unvested stock
options, and the extension of the expiration date to three
years, after the occurrence of certain events. These events
include a change in control of the Company, termination of the
executives employment by the Company without cause or
separation of employment by the executive for good
reason as defined in the agreements. Should any of these
events occur, the Company may be required to record an expense
based upon the difference between the original grant price of
the options and the fair value at the modification date for the
number of shares ultimately affected by the modification. As of
December28, 2008, approximately 11million shares
were affected by these agreements of which approximately
03million shares were unvested.   In December 2008, the President of Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc.
resigned his position with the Company and the Company entered
into a separation agreement. According to the terms of the
agreement, the Company paid severance compensation and
accelerated the vesting of approximately 71,000 unvested stock
options and extended the exercise period of all outstanding
stock options. These terms resulted in the recognition of
additional non-cash share-based compensation expense of
$12million and a cash severance payment of
$08million for the year ended December28, 2008.   
13.
Partnership
Structure   The Company utilizes a partnership philosophy to facilitate the
development, leadership and operation of its restaurants.
Historically, this philosophy has been embodied in a traditional
legal partnership structure, which includes capital
contributions from partners in exchange for an ownership stake
in the profits and losses of the Companys restaurants.
Each partner is required to make a capital contribution in
exchange for their percentage interest in the restaurant or
region the partner is employed to manage. The ownership interest
purchased by each partner generally ranges between two and ten
percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees. At the
end of a specific term generally five years, the Company has
the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the minority
partners interest in the partners respective
restaurant or region at fair market value. An estimated fair
value is determined by reference to current industry purchase
metrics as well as the historical cash flows or net income of
the subject restaurant or region, as appropriate. The Company
has the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in cash
over a period of time not to exceed five years.   Effective January 2007 for new store openings, the Bistro
employs a different structure to achieve the same goal. At the
restaurant level, the Bistros Operating and Culinary
Partners partners in the philosophical not legal
sense share in the profitability of the restaurant as well as
participate in a long-term incentive program that rewards
enhancement of economic value. Due to this change in partnership
structure, individuals participating in the new plan receive
amounts classified as compensation expense rather than a share
of partnership earnings. Accordingly, compensation expense for
the Bistros Operating and Culinary Partners is reflected
in the consolidated income statement as labor expense.
Additionally, a similar structure exists for the Bistros
Market Partners, Market Chefs and Regional Vice Presidents, with
related compensation expense reflected as general and
administrative expense in the consolidated income statement.
Partner investment expense is no longer recognized for new
Bistro restaurant openings beginning in 2007 as a result of this
change; however, for those partners who are bought out prior to
the restaurant reaching maturity typically after five years of
operation, partner investment expense includes a reversal

December28, 2008 and December30, 2007, the Company
had deferred tax assets totaling $06million and $03
million, respectively, related to state net operating loss
carryforwards in certain states where stand-alone tax returns
are filed. These losses expire over the next five to
20years. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance to
offset the deferred tax assets for those losses that the Company
does not anticipate being able to utilize prior to their
expiration.   At December28, 2008, the Company took advantage of
additional tax deductions available relating to the exercise of
non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of
incentive stock options. Accordingly, for the years ended
December28, 2008, December30, 2007, and
December31, 2006, the Company recorded a $02million
$43million, and $19million, respectively, increase
to equity with a corresponding reduction to income tax
liability. Additionally, at December 28, 2008 and December 30,
2007, the Company reversed $08million and $04 million,
respectively, of deferred tax assets related to fully vested
cancelled options for which the Company will not receive a tax
benefit. Quarterly adjustments for the exercise of non-qualified
stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock
options may vary as they relate to the actions of the option
holder or shareholder.   The reserve for uncertain tax positions was $13million
and $12million, respectively, at December28, 2008
and December30, 2007. This balance is the Companys
best estimate of the potential liability for uncertain tax
positions. The increase in the uncertain tax position reserve
was primarily due to the current year requirements for uncertain
asserted and unasserted items, as well as preliminary audit
assessments that will settle during 2009. This increase was
partially offset by decreases to the reserve relating to the
expiration of the statute of limitations for certain
jurisdictions. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax
contingencies due to changes in tax law, both legislated and
concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court
systems.

defined as income from operations before general and
administrative, preopening and partner investment expenses, but
including minority interest. Because preopening and partner
investment expenses are solely related to expansion of the
Companys business, they make an accurate assessment of its
ongoing operations more difficult and are therefore excluded.
Additionally, general and administrative expenses are only
included in the Companys consolidated financial results as
these costs relate to support of both restaurant concepts and
are generally not specifically identifiable to individual
restaurant operations. As the Companys expansion is funded
entirely from its ongoing restaurant operations, segment
profitability is a primary consideration when determining
whether and when to open additional restaurants.   Reconciliation of Non-GAAPFinancial Information to GAAP

Controls
and Procedures   Disclosure Controls and Procedures We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
Companys reports under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our Co-Chief Executive Officers Co-CEOs
and Chief Financial Officer CFO, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives, as the Companys controls are designed to do,
and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the risk related to controls and procedures.   In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on
Form10-K,
as of December28, 2008, an evaluation was performed under
the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including the
Co-CEOs and
CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rule13a-15e
under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Co-CEOs
and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of December28, 2008. These conclusions
were communicated to the Audit Committee.   Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f
under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed
to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management
and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements. All internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation.   Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December28, 2008.
In making its assessment of internal control over financial
reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control
Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, our Co-CEOs
and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December28, 2008 based on
the criteria set forth by COSO in Internal
Control Integrated Framework.   Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has
issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting. This report appears
below.   Change in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during our last
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
