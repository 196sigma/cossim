OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders
Evolution Petroleum Corporation
Houston, Texas We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Evolution Petroleum Corporation as of June30, 2010 and 2009 and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and
cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June30, 2010. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Evolution Petroleum Corporation as of June30, 2010
and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the two years in the period ended June30, 2010 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We were not engaged to examine managements assertion
about the effectiveness of Evolution Petroleum Corporations internal controls
over financial reporting as of June30, 2010 included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and,
accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon. HEIN ASSOCIATES LLP Houston, Texas

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Note 1 Organization and Basis of Preparation Nature of Operations.Evolution
Petroleum Corporation EPM and its subsidiaries the Company, we, our
or us, is an independent petroleum company headquartered in Houston, Texas
and incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are engaged primarily in the acquisition,
exploitation and development of properties for the production of crude oil and
natural gas. We acquire properties with
known oil and natural gas resources and exploit them through the application of
conventional and specialized technology to increase production, ultimate
recoveries, or both. Principles of Consolidation and Reporting. Our consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of EPM and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: NGS Sub Corp and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Tertiaire Resources Company, NGS Technologies,Inc.,
and Evolution Operating Corp. All
significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements for the previous year include certain
reclassifications that were made to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications have no impact on
previously reported income or stockholders equity. Use of Estimates. The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods.
Significant estimates include reserve quantities and estimated future
cash flows associated with proved reserves, which significantly impact
depletion expense and potential impairments of oil and natural gas properties,
income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation
and commitments and contingencies. We
analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. While we believe that our
estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial
statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those estimates. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash
Equivalents. We consider
all highly liquid investments, with original maturities of 90 days or less when
purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts. We
establish provisions for losses on accounts receivables if it is determined
that collection of all or a part of an outstanding balance is not
probable. Collectability is reviewed
regularly and an allowance is established or adjusted, as necessary, using the
specific identification method. As of June30,
2010 and 2009, no allowance for doubtful accounts was considered necessary. Oil and Natural
Gas Properties. We use the full cost method of accounting for
our investments in oil and natural gas properties. Under this method of accounting, all costs
incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas
properties, including unproductive wells, are capitalized. This includes any internal costs that are
directly related to property acquisition, exploration and development
activities but does not include any costs related to production, general
corporate overhead or similar activities.
Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and natural gas
properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter
the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves. Oil and natural gas
properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or
amortized. Excluded costs represent investments in unproved and unevaluated
properties and include non-producing leasehold, geological and geophysical
costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling
costs. We exclude these costs until the project is evaluated and proved
reserves are established or impairment is determined. Excluded costs are
reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount
of any evaluated or impaired oil and natural gas properties is transferred to
capitalized costs being amortized the Full-cost Pool. Limitation on Capitalized Costs. Under the full-cost method
of accounting, we are required, at the end of each fiscal quarter, to perform a
test to determine the limit on the book value of our oil and natural gas
properties the Ceiling Test. If the capitalized cost of our oil and natural
gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and related deferred income
taxes the Net Capitalized Costs, exceed the Ceiling, this excess or
impairment is charged to expense and reflected as additional accumulated
depreciation, depletion and amortization or as a credit to oil and natural gas
properties. The expense may not be
reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and natural gas prices may
subsequently increase the Ceiling. The
Ceiling is defined as the sum of: athe present value, discounted at 10
percent, and assuming continuation of existing economic 47 Table of Contents EVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued conditions, of 1 estimated
future gross revenues from proved reserves, which is computed using oil and
natural gas prices determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to
the end of the reporting period with consideration of price changes only to
the extent provided by contractual arrangements including hedging arrangements
pursuant to SAB 103, less 2 estimated future expenditures based on current
costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves; plus bthe
cost of properties not being amortized pursuant to Reg. S-X Rule4-10
c3ii; plus cthe lower of cost or estimated fair value of
unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; net of dthe
related tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of
our oil and natural gas properties. Our
Ceiling Test did not result in an impairment of our oil and natural gas
properties during the years ended June30, 2010 and 2009. Other Property
and Equipment. Other
property and equipment includes buildings, data processing and
telecommunications equipment, office furniture and equipment, and other fixed
assets. These items are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the
straight-line method based on expected lives of the individual assets or group
of assets, which ranges from three to five years. Repairs and maintenance costs
are expensed in the period incurred. Asset Retirement Obligations. An asset retirement obligation associated
with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset is recognized as a liability
in the period incurred, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of
the related long-lived asset, our oil and natural gas properties. The cost of
the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depleted over the
useful life of the asset. The asset retirement obligation is recorded at its
estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash
outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at our
credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Accretion expense is recognized over
time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
If the estimated future cost of the asset retirement obligation changes, an
adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the
long-lived asset. Revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result
from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation
rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments. Our
financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of
deposit, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying amounts of
these approximate fair value, due to the highly liquid nature of these
short-term instruments. Stock-based
Compensation.
We record all share-based
payment expense in our financial statements based on the fair value of the
award on the grant date. We use the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model as the most appropriate fair-value method
for our stock option awards. Restricted
stock awards are valued using the market price of our common stock on the grant
date. We record compensation cost, net
of estimated forfeitures, for stock-based compensation awards over the
requisite service period on a straight-line basis as the awards vest. As each award vests, an adjustment is made to
compensation cost for any difference between the estimated forfeitures and the
actual forfeitures related to the vested awards. Revenue
Recognition. We recognize
oil and natural gas revenue from our interests in producing wells at the time
that title passes to the purchaser. As a
result, we accrue revenues related to production sold for which we have not
received payment. Depreciation,
Depletion and Amortization. The depreciable base for oil and natural gas
properties includes the sum of all capitalized costs net of DDA, estimated
future development costs and asset retirement costs not included in oil and
natural gas properties, less costs excluded from amortization. The depreciable
base of oil and natural gas properties is amortized using the unit-of-production
method. Other property including, leasehold improvements, office and computer
equipment and vehicles which are stated at original cost and depreciated using
the straight-line method over the useful life of the assets, which ranges from
three to five years. Income Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that may
result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The measurement of
deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance based upon
managements assessment of available evidence if it is deemed more likely than
not some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable. We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain
position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position and will record
the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. 48 Table of Contents EVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Earnings loss per share. Basic Earnings loss per share EPS is
computed by dividing earnings or loss by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding less any non-vested restricted common stock
outstanding. The computation of diluted
EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS, except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have
been outstanding if potential dilutive common shares had been issued. Our potential dilutive common shares are our
outstanding stock options, warrants, and non-vested restricted common stock. The dilutive effect of our potential dilutive
common shares is reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, exercise of
stock options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period or
at time of issuance, if later and common shares shall be assumed to be issued;
the proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock
at the average market price during the period; and the incremental shares the
difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares
assumed purchased shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS
computation. Potential dilutive common
shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. Including potential dilutive common shares
in the denominator of a diluted EPS computation for continuing operations
always will result in an anti-dilutive per-share amount when an entity has a
loss from continuing operations and no potential dilutive common shares shall
be included in the computation of diluted
EPS when a loss from continuing operations exists. Note 3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements New Accounting Standards. We disclose the
existence and potential effect of accounting standards issued but not yet
adopted by us or recently adopted by us with respect to accounting standards
that may have an impact on us in the future. On
December31, 2008, the SEC released new requirements for reporting oil and
gas reserves the Modernization Requirements. The Modernization
Requirements, when effective, provide for consideration of current technology
in evaluating reserves, allow companies to disclose their probable and possible
reserves to investors, require reporting of oil and gas reserves using an
average price based on the prior 12-month period rather than period-end prices,
revise the disclosure requirements for oil and gas operations, and revise
accounting for the limitation on capitalized costs for full cost
companies. The Modernization Requirements are effective for fiscal years
ending on or after December31, 2009.
A company may not apply the Modernization Requirements to disclosures in
quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised
disclosures are required. The
Modernization Requirements did not have material affect on our financial
statements. The SEC staff issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB 113 SAB 113, which revises portions of the
guidance included in SAB Topic 12, Oil and
Gas Producing Activities.
Specifically, SAB 113 revises the relevant interpretive guidance in SAB
Topic 12 to conform it to the Modernization Requirements. On January6, 2010, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update 2010-03 Extractive Activities - Oil
and Gas Topic 932: Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures,
an update of ASC Topic 932 Extractive
Activities - Oil and Gas Topic
932, which substantially aligns the reserve estimation, disclosure
requirements, and definitions of Topic 932 with the disclosure requirements of
the Modernization Requirements issued by the SEC. EPS 49 Table of Contents EVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 7 Stock-Based Incentive Plan Continued Offer to Exchange The
extreme financial market volatility encountered during fiscal 2009 caused us to
reassess the continued effectiveness of our outstanding stock options granted
to employees for the purposes of retention and equity participation. Based on managements analysis and
considerable review, our Board of Directors approved an exchange offer to
employees with out-of-the-money options, excluding Executive Officers and
Directors. Under the terms of the offer,
each eligible option to purchase 1727 shares could be exchanged for one share
of restricted common stock. In return,
the company and shareholders benefited by ire-establishing the
retention incentive for nonexecutive employees, iiadding one additional
year of vesting to all awards exchanged, as further described below, iiireduced
dilution as the number of restricted shares issued was substantially less than
the options exchanged and the exchanged options were returned to the 2004 Plan,
and ivspread the expense of the incentives over a longer period of
time. Accordingly,
we filed a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the SEC on May15,
2009, and amendments on May21, 2009, June9, 2009, and a final
filing on July2, 2009 announcing termination of the offer, relating to an
offer by us to certain employees excluding Named Executive Officers to
exchange certain outstanding Stock Options granted under the 2004 Stock Plan,
with shares of Restricted Stock the Offer to Exchange. The Offer to Exchange expired on
June19, 2009 the Expiration Date. Pursuant to the Offer to
Exchange, 449,390 eligible Stock Options were tendered and subsequently
cancelled, representing 54% of the total Stock Options that were eligible for
exchange in the Offer to Exchange. The
shares of common stock that were subject to the cancelled Stock Options will be
available for future awards under our 2004 Stock Plan. On June19, 2009 the Company granted an
aggregate of 260,170 shares of Restricted Stock in exchange for the Stock
Options surrendered in the Offer to Exchange. We
will recognize the unrecognized compensation cost associated with the 449,390
Stock Options cancelled pursuant to the Offer to Exchange of approximately
$1,068,430 along with the incremental compensation cost of $78,891 ratably over
the vesting period of the Restricted Stock.
The incremental compensation, determined on June19, 2009, was
measured as the excess of the fair value of the Restricted Stock granted in the
Offer to Exchange, over the fair value of the Stock Options surrendered prior
to cancellation. The price of our common stock as of June19, 2009
was $285, however, due to the stock-based compensation requirements, we will
recognize expense ratably over the vesting period of the Restricted Stock
granted in the Offer to Exchange of approximately $441 per share. The
shares of Restricted Stock granted in the Offer to Exchange were unvested at
the time of grant and will become vested on the basis of continued service with
the Company in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Offer to
Exchange as follows: If and to the extent the Stock Options surrendered
were vested on the Expiration Date, the Restricted Stock exchanged for those
vested Stock Options will become vested on the first anniversary of the Expiration
Date, being June19, 2010. If and to the extent any Stock Options
surrendered were not vested on the Expiration Date the Restricted Stock
exchanged for those unvested Stock Options will become vested on the first
anniversary of the original vesting dateson which such unvested Stock
Options would have otherwise become vested.
The Restricted Stock granted pursuant to the Offer to Exchange will vest
over a weighted average period of approximately four years. Stock Options and Incentive Warrants Non-cash
stock-based compensation expense related to Stock Options and Incentive
Warrants for the year ended June30, 2010 and 2009 was $985,060 and
$1,786,055, respectively. There
were no Stock Options granted during the year ended June30, 2010. We granted Stock Options to purchase 591,090
shares of common stock under the 2004 Stock Plan with a weighted average
exercise price of $427. The exercise
price was determined based on the market price of the Companys common stock on
the date of grant. The Stock Options
granted during the years ended June30, 2009 generally vest quarterly, on
a straight line basis, over a period of four years. The Stock Options granted during the year
ended June30, 2009 have a contractual life of seven. The weighted average assumptions used to
calculate the fair value of these Stock Options and the weighted average fair
value of each option granted are as follows 53 Table of

estimated the fair value of Stock Options and Incentive Warrants issued to
employees and directors at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton
valuation model. The risk-free rate is
based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected term estimated period of time
outstanding of Stock Options and Incentive Warrants is based on the simplified
method of the estimated expected term for plain vanilla options allowed by
the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No107 and SAB No110,
and varied based on the vesting period and contractual term of the Stock
Options or Incentive Warrants. Expected volatility is based on the
historical volatility of the Companys closing common stock price and that of
an evaluation of a peer group of similar companies trading activity. We
have not declared any cash dividends on the Companys common stock. The

Note 9 Income Taxes We
file a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States and various
combined and separate filings in several state and local jurisdictions. There
were no unrecognized tax benefits nor any accrued interest or penalties
associated with unrecognized tax benefits during the year ended June30,
2010 and 2009. We believe that we have
appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on the
Companys tax returns and that the accruals for tax liabilities are adequate
for all open years based on our assessment of many factors including past
experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter.
The Companys federal and state income tax returns are open to audit under the
statute of limitations for the years ending June30, 2007 through June30,

The total AMT
credit carryforward is $775,807. Our net
deferred tax liability does not include $129,869 of AMT credit carryforward
associated with the windfall tax benefit. We
expect to recover approximately $07 million in federal income taxes paid
during the tax year ended June30, 2007, as a result of the carry-back of
our 2010 income tax loss. Significant
intangible drilling costs were incurred during the 2010 fiscal year, of which,
we elected to deduct expense approximately $13 million for federal and state
income tax purposes. During the year
ended June30, 2009, we received approximately $21 million in federal
income taxes paid during the tax years ended June30, 2007 and 2006, as a
result of the carry-back of our 2009 income tax loss. Significant intangible drilling costs were
incurred during the 2009 fiscal year, of which, we elected to deduct expense
approximately $48 million for federal and state income tax purposes. Under GAAP, and specifically the full-cost accounting
method, intangible drilling costs are capitalized as part of oil and natural
gas properties, and depleted using the unit-of-production method. The deduction of intangible drilling costs
resulted in a significant difference in the income tax and book basis of our
oil and natural gas properties. At
June30, 2010, we have a federal tax loss carryforward of approximately
$159 million that we acquired through the reverse merger in May2004, of
which, approximately $06 million is
available to us to use in equal amounts through 2023. We have applied a valuation allowance against
the portion of the federal tax loss carryforward that has been disallowed
through IRC Section382. Note 10 Related Party Transactions Laird Q. Cagan, a member of
our Board of Directors, is a Managing Director and co-owner of Cagan McAfee
Capital Partners, LLC CMCP. CMCP has
performed financial advisory services to us pursuant to a written agreement
amended in December2008. Also
pursuant to the Agreement, Mr.Cagan, as a registered representative of
Colorado Financial Services Corporation and as a partner of CMCP, could serve
as our placement agent in private equity financings, wherein CMCP could earn
cash fees equal to 8% of gross equity proceeds, declining to 4% subject to the
amount of equity raised through CMCP, and a fixed 4% warrant fee. We have not paid placement fees to CMCP under
this agreement since May2006. Eric A. McAfee, a major
shareholder of the Company, is also a Managing Director of CMCP. On
October27, 2009, we issued CMCP 119,795 shares of common stock through a
net cashless exercise of a placement warrant.
The placement warrant, which was issued to CMCP on May26, 2004 in
connection with a financing transaction, gave CMCP the right to purchase
165,000 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $100 per share. See also Note 6 for equity

with the Companys three senior executives.
The employment contracts provide for a severance package for termination
by the Company for any reason other than cause or permanent disability, or in
the event of a constructive termination, that includes payment of base pay and
certain medical and disability benefits from six months to a year after
termination. The total contingent
obligation under the employment contracts as of June30, 2010 is
approximately $499,000. Note 13Concentrations of Credit Risk Major Customers. We market all of our oil and
natural gas production from the properties we operate. The majority of our operated gas, oil and
condensate production is sold to a variety of purchasers under short-term less
than 12 months contracts at market-based prices. The following table
identifies customers from whom we derived 10 percent or more our net oil and
natural gas revenues during the years ended June30, 2010 and 2009. Based on the current demand for oil and
natural gas and availability of other customers, we do not believe the loss of
any of these customers would have a significant affect on our operations or financial
condition.

Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
Unaudited We
adopted revised oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements as
of June30, 2010. The primary impact of the new disclosures is to conform
the definition of proved reserves with the Modernization Requirements, which
were issued by the SEC at the end of calendar year 2008. The accounting
standards update revised the definition of proved oil and gas reserves to require
that the average, first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period
before the end of the year rather than the year-end price, must be used when
estimating whether reserve quantities are economical to produce. This same
12-month average price is also used in calculating the aggregate amount of and
changes in future cash inflows related to the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows. The rulesalso allow for the use of
reliable technology to estimate proved oil and gas reserves if those
technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about
reserve volumes. The unaudited supplemental information on oil and gas
exploration and production activities for 2010 has been presented in accordance
with the new reserve estimation and disclosure rules, which may not be applied
retrospectively. The 2008 and 2009 data are presented in accordance with oil
and gas disclosure requirements effective during those periods. The effect of
applying the new definition of reliable technology and other non-price related
aspects of the updated 60 Table of Contents EVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 16 Supplemental Disclosures about Oil and Natural Gas Producing
Properties unaudited Continued rulesdid
not impact 2010 net proved reserve volumes. The effect of applying the 12-month
average price, versus the June30, 2010 year-end price, increased proved
reserves by less than 2% of total proved reserves. The standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows as of June30, 2010 increased by
approximately $85million as a result of using the 12-month average price
rather than the year-end 2010 price. Proved oil and natural gas
reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under
existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed oil and natural
gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing
wells with existing equipment and operating methods. There are uncertainties
inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves,
projecting future production rates, and timing of development expenditures.
Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and
natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
All of our proved reserves are located in the United States. The
following information about our proved oil and natural gas reserves was

Total
proved reserves increased 94 million BOE from 3,060,040 BOE at June30,
2009 to 12,418,256 BOE at June30, 2010.
The increase is primarily attributable to improved recovery of 9,411,841
barrels of proved oil reserves added to our properties in the Delhi Field,
based on approximately $300 million of development capital spent by the Operator
since project inception, the start-up of CO2 injection operations during fiscal
year 2010, and oil production response during fiscal year 2010. The additions to our properties in the Delhi
Field along with extensions in Giddings and Oklahoma of 127,905 BOE, were
offset by production of 125,515 BOE and negative revisions of 60,943 BOE
primarily related to the transfer of four well locations in the Lopez Field in
South Texas from the proved classification to probable during 2010. The revisions of previous estimates during our
fiscal year ended June30, 2009, were due primarily to the decline in the
price of natural gas. During the year
ended June30, 2008, the revisions of
previous estimates were primarily due to the identification and separation of natural
gas liquids in 2008 and the effects of the new SEC guideline on PUD locations
with fractured reservoirs. Natural gas
liquids were not separately identified in the June30, 2007 independent
report prepared by Von Gonten. Purchases
of minerals in place during 2009 resulted from leasehold acquisitions of proved
undeveloped reserves in the Giddings Field and in our Neptune Oil Project in
South Texas. Purchases
of minerals in place during 2008 resulted from leasehold acquisitions of proved
undeveloped reserves that directly offset currently or historically productive
wells in the same fracture trend in the Giddings Field. 61 Table of Contents EVOLUTION PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Properties unaudited Continued Standardized
Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Future oil and natural gas
sales and production and development costs have been estimated using prices and
costs in effect at the end of the years indicated, as required by ASC 932, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities ASC 932. ASC 932 requires that net cash flow
amounts be discounted at 10%. Future production and development costs are
computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and
producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves assuming continuation of
existing economic conditions. Future income tax expenses are computed by
applying the appropriate period-end statutory tax rates to the future pretax
net cash flow relating to our proved oil and natural gas reserves, less the tax
basis of the related properties. The future income tax expenses do not give
effect to tax credits, allowances, or the impact of general and administrative
costs of ongoing operations relating to the Companys proved oil and natural
gas reserves. Changes in the demand for
oil and natural gas, inflation, and other factors make such estimates
inherently imprecise and subject to substantial revision. The table below
should not be construed to be an estimate of the current market value of the
our proved reserves. The standardized measure of

Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as defined in Rules13a-15fand 15d-15f of
the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by
the Companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
includes those policies and procedures that Pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material affect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
the Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation was conducted on the effectiveness
of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on criteria
established in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management concluded that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June30,
2010. This annual report does not
include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting
firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to
attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to rulesof
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 63 Table of Contents Changes in
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in
