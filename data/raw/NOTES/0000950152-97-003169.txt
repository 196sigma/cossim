Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   25             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of OfficeMax, Inc.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index on
this page present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
OfficeMax, Inc. and its subsidiaries at January 25, 1997 and January 27, 1996,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January 25, 1997, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. s/ Price Waterhouse LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
OfficeMax, Inc. OfficeMax or the Company operates a chain of
high-volume, deep-discount office products superstores. At January 25, 1997, the
Company owned and operated 564 stores in 47 states and Puerto Rico and had a 19%
investment in a joint venture in Mexico which operates OfficeMax superstores
similar to those in the U.S.
The Company initial public offering the Offering on November 2,
1994 resulted in 80,325,000 common shares, without par value, being sold to the
public. At the time of the Offering, Kmart Corporation Kmart owned a 927%
equity interest in the Company. The proceeds from the Offering were paid to
Kmart and 7,165,742 common shares the additional Kmart Shares were issued to
Kmart, reducing Kmart ownership in the Company to approximately 25%.
Additionally, the Company, at the time of the Offering, issued 790,577 common
shares the Management Shares pursuant to a Management Share Purchase Plan
adopted in connection with the Offering. See Note 2 for further discussion of
the Company historical relationship with Kmart.
On July 20, 1995, the Company sold 8,627,774 of its common shares in a
public offering the Secondary Offering. Net proceeds from the sale of these
shares amounted to $110,177,000, after deducting underwriters' discounts and
commissions. As part of the Secondary Offering, Kmart sold all of its remaining
shares.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Company consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates,
representing less than 20% of the ownership of such companies, are accounted for
under the cost method and loans, which the Company makes from time to time to
these affiliates, are recorded in other assets.
The Company fiscal year ends on the Saturday prior to the last
Wednesday in January. Fiscal years 1996 fiscal 1996 and fiscal year 1994
fiscal 1994 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on January 25, 1997 and January
21, 1995, respectively. Fiscal year 1995 fiscal 1995 consisted of 53 weeks
and ended on January 27, 1996.
On May 22, 1996, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock
split in the form of a 50% share dividend payable July 9, 1996 to shareholders
of record as of June 3, 1996. All share, average share and per share amounts
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
give retroactive effect to the share dividend.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to
conform to the current presentation.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
Earnings per common share is based on the weighted average of common
and common equivalent shares outstanding in fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995. Common
equivalent shares relate to outstanding stock options.
The pro forma earnings per common share data for fiscal 1994 has been
prepared assuming that the Offering and the issuance of the Additional Kmart
Shares and Management Shares had taken place at the beginning of the period.
Options outstanding under the Company option plans and options granted in
connection with the Offering are treated as common share equivalents for
purposes of pro forma earnings per common share. The pro                     25
26 forma earnings per common share data are not necessarily indicative of what
actual earnings per common share would have been had such transactions occurred
on the basis assumed.  The pro forma weighted average number of common shares outstanding for 
fiscal 1994 is as follows: 
Common Shares outstanding during year                 52,685,000 
Common Share equivalents for options outstanding             842,000 
Pro forma adjustments:
Common Shares offered by the Company in the Offering        52,727,000
Additional Kmart shares                       7,165,000
Management Shares                           790,000
Common Share equivalents for options granted in
connection with the Management Shares                 178,000
Total pro forma weighted average number of shares           114,387,000

Cash and equivalents includes short-term investments with original
maturities of 90 days or less.
Marketable securities are classified as held-to-maturity. These
securities are carried at amortized cost of $190,674,000 at January 25, 1997 and
consist primarily of investments in commercial paper and government securities
with maturities of ninety days or less.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Accounts receivable primarily consists of amounts due from vendors
under rebate, cooperative advertising and other contractual programs and trade
receivables not financed through outside programs. Also included in this balance
is a receivable for a credit due from a service provider. See Note 5 for
further discussion.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Components of property and equipment are recorded at cost and
depreciated over their respective estimated useful lives using the straight-line
method for financial statement purposes and accelerated methods for income tax
purposes. Most store properties are leased, and improvements are amortized over
the lesser of the term of the lease or 20 years. Other annual rates used in
computing depreciation are 14% - 20% for store fixtures and 20% - 33% for other
fixtures and equipment.
INCOME TAXES
The Company uses the liability method whereby income taxes are
recognized during the year in which transactions enter into the determination of
financial statement income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is amortized over 40 years using the straight-line method. The
Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and reviews the amortization
period on an annual basis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows from
operating activities with the carrying value of goodwill. Based on its review,
the Company does not believe that an impairment of its goodwill has occurred.                    26
27 CURRENT LIABILITIES
Under the Company cash management system, checks issued pending
clearance result in overdraft balances for accounting purposes and are included
in the accounts payable balance. The amounts reclassified were $107,317,000 and
$75,027,000 for fiscal 1996 and 1995, respectively.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The recorded value of the Company financial instruments, which
includes short term securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
mortgage payable, approximates fair value. Financial instruments, which
potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist
principally of cash investments. The Company invests its excess cash in high
quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. The
Company has established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to
maintain safety and liquidity.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
Effective January 27, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,
FAS123. As provided for under FAS123, the Company has elected to continue to
account for stock based compensation under the provisions of Accounting
Principles Boards APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if
any, of the quoted market price of the Company stock at the date of the grant
over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Pro forma disclosures
of net earnings and earnings per share, as if the fair value based method of
accounting defined in FAS123 had been applied, are presented in Note 10.
PRE-OPENING EXPENSES
Costs associated with the opening of a new store are expensed during
the first month of the store operation.
NOTE 2. RELATIONSHIP AND INTERCOMPANY AGREEMENTS WITH KMART CORPORATION
INTERCOMPANY AGREEMENT
Prior to the Offering, all amounts necessary to fund the Company
working capital and expansion, to the extent not provided through internally
generated funds, were provided by Kmart. These amounts have been reflected in
the Company consolidated financial statements as equity transactions, and the
Company recorded such transactions as additional paid-in capital. Net equity
transactions in fiscal 1994 totaled $95,839,000 and consisted primarily of cash
management and the additional investment in Corporate Express, Inc. For the
period subsequent to the Offering and prior to July 20, 1995, Kmart provided the
Company participation in certain centrally managed employee benefit and
self-insurance programs. The Company had a similar arrangement with Kmart prior
to the Offering, including the allocation of administrative costs related to
Kmart specialty retail division. This agreement terminated on July 20, 1995.
CASH MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
Prior to the Offering and for a period of 180 days after the Offering,
Kmart provided the Company with cash management services and financing,
including the investment of surplus cash. The Company historical financial
statements reflect net funding provided by Kmart to the Company as adjustments
of Kmart investment in the Company and, accordingly, do not reflect interest
expense on net cash transfers between the Company and Kmart. Had such
transactions, except those relating to acquisitions, between the Company and
Kmart been accounted for as short-term loans, and assuming the Company
anticipated incremental borrowing rate under its Revolving Credit Facility was
in effect throughout the period, on a pro forma basis the Company would have
incurred interest expense of $1,600,000 for fiscal 1994. Under the agreement,
which expired on May 8, 1995, the Company had $141,017,000 in excess cash on
deposit with Kmart at January 21, 1995.                    27
28 LEASE GUARANTEE AGREEMENT
Kmart continues to guarantee certain of the Company leases in effect
at the date of the Offering and provides guarantees which it previously
committed to with respect to stores opened after the Offering and prior to the
end of fiscal 1995. Such lease guarantees are provided by Kmart at no cost to
the Company. The Company has agreed to indemnify Kmart for any losses incurred
by Kmart as a result of actions, omissions or defaults on the part of OfficeMax,
as well as for all amounts paid by Kmart pursuant to Kmart guarantees of the
Company leases. The agreement contains certain financial and operating
covenants, including restrictions on the Company ability to pay dividends,
incur indebtedness, incur liens or merge with another entity.
TAX ALLOCATION AND INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT
The Company remains severally liable, with Kmart and Kmart other
subsidiaries, for Kmart federal tax liabilities for any period in which the
Company was included in the Kmart consolidated return. However, Kmart will
indemnify the Company for any federal income tax liability of Kmart or any of
Kmart subsidiaries other than that which is attributable to the Company that
the Company may be required to pay; further, the Company will indemnify Kmart
for any of the Company federal income tax liabilities which Kmart may be
required to pay.
The Company was included in the consolidated United States federal
income tax return filed by Kmart for the taxable period ending on or before
November 9, 1994, the settlement date of the Offering. Accordingly, the
provision for federal income taxes and the related payments or refunds of tax
relating to this period were determined on a consolidated basis. The Company
federal income tax provision and related tax payments or refunds have been
reflected in the Company financial statements in accordance with Kmart tax
allocation policy.
The Company income tax provisions computed on a stand alone company
basis in fiscal 1994 would not have been materially different from those
recorded in its financial statements.
NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS
CORPORATE EXPRESS
On September 11, 1995, the Company sold its interest in Corporate
Express, Inc. Corporate Express for $195,831,000, resulting in a gain of
$118,014,000 after-tax gain of $69,124,000, or $057 per share. Prior to the
sale of its investment, the Company owned approximately 20% of Corporate
Express.
NOTE 4. DEBT
LINE OF CREDIT
The Company has entered into a credit agreement for a $100 million
revolving credit facility Revolving Credit Facility with its principal bank
and a syndicate of five other domestic banks. The Revolving Credit Facility
provides for borrowings bearing an interest rate based on the principal bank
prime rate or reserve adjusted LIBOR plus 20% to 325%. In addition, the
Company must also pay on a quarterly basis fees ranging from 125% to 175% per
annum on the available and unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Revolving Credit Facility expires May 8, 1999, but can be extended
for one year provided the Company meets certain requirements. Standby letters of
credit issued in connection with the Company self insurance program are
considered outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility and totaled
$10,675,000 and $6,975,000 as of January 25, 1997 and January 27, 1996,
respectively. There were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of
January 25, 1997 and January 27, 1996.
MORTGAGE
On January 16, 1997, the Company entered into a $20 million mortgage
agreement the Mortgage secured by its Shaker Hts., Ohio international
corporate headquarters. The Mortgage has a fixed term of 10 years, quarterly
amortization payments of $325,000 plus interest at 699% per annum after giving
effect to an interest rate swap with a final payment of $7 million due at
maturity. Maturities of long term borrowings will be $13 million over each of
the next five years.                    28
29     The Revolving Credit Facility and the Mortgage contain similar
financial covenants with respect to consolidated net worth, fixed charge
coverage, funded indebtedness and consolidated leverage ratios.
NOTE 5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is currently in discussions with a service provider
concerning amounts that the Company claims it is entitled to pursuant to the
terms of an ongoing service contract. The Company has remitted all amounts
currently due under the terms of the agreement and has recorded a receivable for
a credit of approximately $15 million based on management interpretation of
the terms and conditions of the contract. There are also various other claims,
lawsuits and pending actions against the Company incident to the Company
operations. It is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of
these matters will not have a material effect on the Company liquidity,
financial position or results of operations. However, in the event of an
unanticipated final determination in respect of certain outstanding matters, the
Company consolidated net income for the period in which such determination
occurs could be materially affected.
NOTE 6. PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM
The Company has an arrangement with a financial services company the
Issuer whereby the Issuer manages two private label credit card programs for
the Company. The credit card accounts, and receivables generated thereby, are
owned by the Issuer. Under the terms of the agreement, the Issuer charges the
Company a fee to cover the Issuers' cost of providing credit and collecting the
receivables which are non-recourse to the Company.

STOCK PURCHASE PLANS
In connection with the Offering, the Company adopted a Management Share
Purchase Plan the Management Plan, an Employee Share Purchase Plan the
Employee Plan and a Director Plan the Director Plan. Under the Management
Plan, the Company senior management personnel are required to use 20%, and may
use up to 100%, of their annual incentive bonuses to purchase restricted common
shares of the Company at a 20% discount from the fair value of the same number
of unrestricted common shares. In addition, senior management personnel were
given a one-time opportunity to invest up to $1 million each to purchase
restricted common shares at the time of the Offering at a 20% discount from the
initial public offering price, net of underwriting discounts and commissions.
For each restricted common share purchased, the Company granted the employee an
option to purchase one additional restricted common share at the initial public
offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions. Restricted common
shares purchased under the Management Plan will generally be restricted from
sale or transfer for three years from date of purchase. The maximum number of
common shares reserved for issuance under the Management Plan is 1,242,227. The
Company recognized compensation expense for the discount on the restricted
common shares of $643,000, $541,000 and $135,000 for fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
The Employee Plan is available to all full-time employees of the
Company who are not covered under the Management Plan and who have worked at
least 1,000 hours during a period of 12 consecutive months. Each eligible
employee has the right to purchase, on a quarterly basis, the Company common
shares at a 15% discount from the fair market value per common share. Shares
purchased under the Employee Plan are generally restricted from sale for one
year from date of purchase. The maximum number of shares eligible for purchase
under this plan is 2,958,761. The Company does not record compensation expense
with respect to shares purchased under the Employee Plan.
The Director Plan covers all directors of the Company who are not
officers or employees of the Company. Each participant will receive all of their
annual retainer in the form of restricted shares paid at the beginning of the
relevant calendar year and all of their meeting fees in the form of unrestricted
common shares paid at the end of the calendar quarter in which the meetings
occurred. The restrictions on such shares generally lapse one year from the date
of grant. The maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the Director
Plan is 112,929.
SAVINGS PLAN
Employees of the Company who meet certain service requirements are
eligible to participate in the Company 401k savings plan. Participants may

50% of the first 3%, effective February 1, 1997. Such matching Company
contributions are invested in shares of the Company common stock and become
vested 50% after two years of service and 100% after three years of service. The
charge to operations for the Company matching contribution amounted to
$322,000 and $132,000 in fiscal 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Equity-Based Award Plan. The Equity-Based Award Plan provides for the issuance
of share appreciation rights, restricted shares and up to 11,647,343 options to
purchase common shares. Options granted under the Equity-Based Award Plan become
exercisable from one to seven years after the date of grant and expire ten years
from date of grant. Options may be granted only at option prices not less than
the fair market value per common share on the date of the grant except that in
connection with the Offering, options to purchase common shares were granted at
the initial public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions.
The Company recognized compensation expense on these grants of $188,000 240,000 and $60,000 for fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
Under FAS 123, the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted average
assumptions used for grants in fiscal 1996 and 1995,                     32
33 respectively, were expected volatility of 418% and 431% and risk-free interest
rates of 621% and 723%. A dividend yield of zero and an expected life of 5
years were used in the model for both years.

fair value at the date of grant was $658 and $578 for options granted in
fiscal 1996 and 1995, respectively. Giving effect to such compensation costs,
pro forma net earnings and pro forma earnings per share would have been
