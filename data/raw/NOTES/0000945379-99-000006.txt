To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Com21, Inc.: 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Com21, Inc. as 
of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the related statements of 
operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 
1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also 
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of Com21, Inc. as of 
December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the results of its operations and 
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.

Com21, Inc.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998
1. Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Business - Com21, Inc. the Company was incorporated in 
Delaware in June 1992. The Company designs, develops, markets 
and sells value-added, high-speed communications solutions for 
the broadband access market. During 1997, the Company exited 
the development stage for financial reporting purposes as it 
completed its initial product development activities and 
commenced shipping product.
Financial Statements Estimates - The preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Such estimates include allowances for potentially 
uncollectable accounts receivable, lower of cost or market 
inventory valuation reserves, warranty costs, sales returns 
and a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications - Certain prior year amounts in the 
accompanying financial statements have been reclassified to 
conform to current year presentation. These reclassifications 
had no effect on the results of operations or financial 
position for any year presented.
Fiscal Period - Although for presentation purposes the Company 
has indicated that its year end is December 31, its fiscal 
year actually ends on the last business day of the year. The 
Company fiscal years for 1996, 1997 and 1998 all ended on 
December 31.
Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid 
debt instruments with maturities at the date of purchase of 
three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-Term Investments - Short-term investments consist of 
corporate and government bonds and are stated at fair value 
based on quoted market prices. Short-term investments are 
classified as available-for-sale based on the Company 
intended use. The difference between amortized cost and fair 
value representing unrealized holding gains or losses are 
recorded as a component of stockholders' equity as accumulated 
other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses on sales of 
investments are determined on a specific identification basis.
Inventories - Inventories consist of networking equipment, 
modems and sub-assemblies stated at the lower of cost first-
in, first-out method or market.
Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at 
cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three 
to seven years. Amortization of leasehold improvements and 
assets recorded under capital lease agreements are computed 
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease 
term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Long-Lived Assets - The Company evaluates long-lived assets 
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be 
recoverable.
Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes under an 
asset and liability approach. Deferred income taxes reflect 
the net tax effects of temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax 
purposes, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
measured by applying currently enacted tax laws. Valuation 
allowances are provided when necessary to reduce net deferred 
tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be 
realized.

Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties - Financial 
instruments which potentially subject the Company to 
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and 
cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts 
receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are held primarily with 
one financial institution and consist primarily of commercial 
paper and cash in bank accounts. The Company investment 
policy is to invest in instruments with minimum credit ratings 
of A-1/P-1 Short-Term or AA Long-Term. The Company sells 
its products primarily to cable operators in North America and 
primarily to systems integrators in Europe, Asia and 
South/Central America, and generally does not require its 
customers to provide collateral or other security to support 
accounts receivable. To reduce credit risk, management 
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' 
financial condition. The Company maintains allowances for 
estimated potential bad debt losses. The recorded carrying 
amount of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, 
accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt obligations 
approximate fair value.
The Company customer base is highly concentrated. A 
relatively small number of customers have accounted for a 
significant portion of the Company revenues, and the Company 
expects that this trend will continue for the foreseeable 
future. For the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, 
the top five customers comprised 100%, 65% and 66%, 
respectively, of the Company total revenues.
The Company participates in a dynamic high technology industry 
and believes that changes in any of the following areas could 
have a material adverse effect on the Company future 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows: 
advances and trends in new technologies and industry 
standards; competitive pressures in the form of new products 
or price reductions on current products; changes in product 
mix; changes in the overall demand for products offered by the 
Company; changes in third-party manufacturers; changes in key 
suppliers; changes in certain strategic relationships or 
customer relationships; litigation or claims against the 
Company based on intellectual property Note 13, patent, 
product, regulatory or other factors; risk associated with 
changes in domestic and international economic and/or 
political conditions or regulations; availability of necessary 
components; risks associated with Year 2000 compliance; and 
the Company ability to attract and retain employees 
necessary to support its growth.
Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes product revenue 
upon shipment. Estimated sales returns and warranty costs, 
based on historical experience by product, are recorded at the 
time the product revenue is recognized. Installation and 
training revenue are recognized as services are provided.
In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Position SOP 97-
2, Software Revenue Recognition, which requires revenue 
earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to 
be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values 
of the elements. Revenue for software licenses is recognized 
upon delivery provided that collection is probable. Software 
support and maintenance revenue are deferred and amortized 
over the maintenance period on a straight-line basis. Adoption 
of this statement did not have a material impact on the 
Company financial position, results of operations and cash 
flows.
Software Development Costs - Development costs incurred in the 
research and development of new software products and 
enhancements to existing software products are expensed as 
incurred until technological feasibility has been established, 
at which time certain development costs required to attain 
general production release would be capitalized. To date, the 
Company software development has essentially been completed 
concurrent with the establishment of technological 
feasibility, and accordingly, no costs have been capitalized.
Stock-Based Compensation - The Company accounts for stock-
based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in 
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB 
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Comprehensive Loss - In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 130, Reporting 
Comprehensive Income, which requires an enterprise to report, 
by major components and as a single total, the change in net 
assets during the period from nonowner sources. Statements of 
comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 
and 1998 have been included with the statements of operations.
Net Loss Per Share - In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 
128, Earnings Per Share which requires a dual presentation 
of basic and diluted earnings per share EPS. Basic EPS 
excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income 
attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average of 
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects 
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other 
contracts to issue common stock convertible preferred stock, 
warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock and common 
stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method 
were exercised or converted into common stock. Potential 
common shares in the diluted EPS computation are excluded in 
net loss periods as their effect would be antidilutive. EPS 
for all periods have been computed in accordance with SFAS No. 
128.
45
Pro Forma Net Loss Per Share - Pro forma net loss per share, 
basic and diluted, is computed by dividing net loss 
attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding for the period and the 
weighted average number of shares resulting from the assumed 
conversion of outstanding shares of convertible preferred 
stock.
Geographic Operating Information - In 1998, the Company 
adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an 
Enterprise and Related Information, which establishes annual 
and interim reporting standards for an enterprise business 
segments and related disclosures about its products, services, 
geographic areas and major customers. The Company operates in 
one reportable segment Note 12.
Recently Issued Accounting Standard - In June 1998, the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging 
Activities. This statement requires companies to record 
derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, 
measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes 
in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for 
depending on the use of the derivative and whether it 
qualifies for hedge accounting. SFAS No. 133 will be effective 
for the Company fiscal year ending December 31, 2000. 
Management believes that this statement will not have a 
significant impact on the Company financial position, 
results of operations or cash flows.

Notes Payable
The unsecured borrowings were obtained from notes payable 
issued to a financing company for the purchase of computer 
software and equipment. Borrowings bear interest at an 
effective interest rate of 1694% per annum and are payable in 
monthly installments with the remaining unpaid principal and 
interest due upon the maturity date. There are no debt 
covenants associated with the notes payable.
In consideration for the unsecured borrowings due on October 
1, 1998 and August 1, 1999 the Company issued the financing 
company warrants to purchase 4,688 and 2,125 shares of Series 
F convertible preferred stock, respectively, at a price of 
$800 per share. The fair values of the warrants were 
insignificant Note 7.
In June 1998, the Company issued a note payable for $215,000 
to a financing company for the payment of its directors' and 
officers' insurance premiums for which the Company is the 
beneficiary. Borrowings bear interest at an effective interest 
rate of 730% per annum and are payable in equal monthly 
installments principal and interest through February 4, 
1999.
Revolving Line of Credit
In May 1997, the Company entered into a revolving line of 
credit arrangement for working capital purposes. Under the 
arrangement, the Company may borrow up to the lesser of 
$5,000,000 or 80% of the Company eligible domestic and 
foreign accounts receivable. Borrowings bear interest at the 
LIBOR rate 510% at December 31, 1998 plus 4875% per annum. 
The arrangement automatically renews for successive one-year 
periods until terminated at the option of either party. 
Dividends may not be declared by the Company without the 
lender prior consent. As of December 31, 1998, no amounts 
were outstanding under the arrangement.
Concurrent with executing the revolving line of credit 
arrangement, the Company borrowed an additional $2,000,000 on 
a note which was repaid in full in 1997.
In consideration for these financing arrangements, the Company 
issued warrants to purchase 25,000 shares of Series F 
convertible preferred stock at a price of $800 per share 
Note 7. As described in Note 7, the fair value of such 
warrants was $72,000 which was recorded as additional interest 
expense in the accompanying statement of operations and 
comprehensive loss for 1997.                    47
6. Commitments

1996, the Company issued warrants to purchase 2,505 shares and 
6,814 shares of Series F convertible preferred stock at a 
price of $800 per share to two financing companies. The fair 
values of the warrants were insignificant Note 7.
Rent expense incurred under the operating leases was 
approximately $501,000, $843,000 and $867,000 for the years 
ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Rent 
expense under the facilities lease is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The difference 
between the amounts paid and the amounts expensed is 
classified as deferred rent in the accompanying balance 
sheets.
In 1998, the Company entered into product development and 
license agreements whereby third parties will develop certain 
technology deliverable in 1999 for an aggregate of $970,000.

obligations of approximately $15,200,000 in connection with 
supply and manufacturing agreements.
7. Stockholders' Equity
Stock Split
On May 13, 1998, the Company effected a one-for-two reverse 
split of the outstanding shares of common and convertible 
preferred stock. All share and per share amounts in these 
financial statements have been adjusted to give effect to the 
reverse stock split.
Initial Public Offering
In May 1998, the Company completed its initial public offering 
of 5,750,000 shares which includes the full exercise of the 
underwriters' overallotment of 750,000 shares which generated 
net proceeds to the Company of $62,791,000.
Authorized Shares
On March 10, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a change in 
the authorized number of shares of the common and undesignated 
preferred stock to 40,000,000 and 5,000,000, respectively.
Convertible Preferred Stock
On April 22, 1998, holders of more than 50% of the Series D, 
E, F and G convertible preferred stock, voting as a single 
class, consented to the automatic conversion of all 
outstanding shares of Series D, E, F and G convertible 
preferred stock into common stock upon the completion of the 
initial public offering regardless of the offering price per 
share. Upon completion of the Company initial public 
offering in May 1998, all shares of Series A, B, and C 
convertible preferred stock were converted to common stock in 
accordance with their existing terms and all shares of Series 
D, E, F and G convertible preferred stock were converted to 
common stock in accordance with the stockholders' consent. All 
shares were converted on a one-to-one basis.
48
Common Stock Warrants
Prior to the Company initial public offering in May 1998, 
the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of various 
series of convertible preferred stock. Upon completion of the 
Company initial public offering, the outstanding warrants to 
purchase 46,286 shares of convertible preferred stock were 
automatically converted into warrants to purchase 46,286 
shares of common stock at the same exercise prices. All such 
warrants were outstanding at December 31, 1997 and 1998 and 
were comprised of the following  During 1995, in consideration of capital lease 
financing provided by a financing company, the Company 
issued warrants to purchase 5,154 shares of Series D 
convertible preferred stock at a price of $582 per share. 
The warrants expire in December 2005.
During 1996, in consideration of debt and capital 
lease financing provided by two financing companies, the 
Company issued warrants to purchase 14,007 shares of 
Series F convertible preferred stock at a price of $800 
per share. The warrants expire in 2006.
During 1997, in consideration of financing 
arrangements provided, the Company issued warrants to 
purchase 27,125 shares of Series F convertible preferred 
stock at a price of $800 per share. The warrants expire 
in May 2002 25,000 warrants and February 2007 2,125 
warrants.
The fair value of the warrants issued in 1995 and 1996, in 
connection with debt financing, were insignificant. The fair 
value of the warrants issued in 1997, in connection with debt 
financing, was approximately $72,000. Accordingly, the fair 
value was recognized as additional interest expense in the 
accompanying statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
for 1997.
Common Stock
At December 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company had the right to 
repurchase 320,311 and 139,640 shares of common stock 
outstanding, respectively. The number of shares subject to 
repurchase is reduced over a two- to four-year vesting period. 
The Company has the right to repurchase these shares at the 
original issuance price.

During 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Company had securities
outstanding which could potentially dilute basic EPS in the 
future, but were excluded in the computation of diluted EPS in 
such periods, as their effect would have been antidilutive due 
to the net loss reported in such periods. Such outstanding 
securities consist of the following at December 31, 1998: 
warrants to purchase 46,286 shares of common stock; 139,640 
outstanding shares of common stock subject to repurchase; and 
options to purchase 2,369,341 shares of common stock.
Equity Plans
Under the Company 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan, 
as restated and amended in January 1998, the Company may grant 
options to purchase up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock to 
employees, directors and consultants at prices not less than 
the fair market value at the date of grant for incentive stock 
options and not less than 85% of fair market value at the date 
of grant for nonstatutory stock options. These options 
generally expire ten years from the date of grant and are 
immediately exercisable. The Company has a right of repurchase 
at the option exercise price of common stock issued from 
option exercises for unvested shares. The right of repurchase 
generally expires 25% after the first 12 months from the date 
of grant and then ratably over a 36-month period.
49
In 1998, the Company adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan 
the 1998 Stock Plan and the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase 
Plan the 1998 Purchase Plan.
The 1998 Stock Plan serves as the successor equity incentive 
program to the Company 1995 Plan. Options outstanding under 
the 1995 Plan on April 1, 1998 2,023,510 shares were 
incorporated into the 1998 Stock Plan. Such incorporated 
options continue to be governed by their existing terms. In 
addition, the share reserve was increased by 500,000 shares 
and could be increased up to an additional 271,570 shares for 
repurchases of unvested common shares issued under the 1995 
Plan. As of December 31, 1998, 16,732 shares of such unvested 
common shares were repurchased and added to the share reserve. 
Under the 1998 Stock Plan, the Company is authorized to issue 
shares of common stock to employees, directors and consultants 
under five separate programs: Discretionary Option, Stock 
Issuance, Salary Investment Option Grant, Automatic Option 
Grant and Director Fee Option Grant. The number of shares 
reserved for issuance under the 1998 Stock Plan automatically 
increases at the beginning of each calendar year, beginning in 
1999, by an amount equal to 5% of the total number of shares 
of common stock outstanding at the end of the preceding year 
934,278 shares on January 4, 1999. The Discretionary Option 
Program of the 1998 Stock Plan provides for the grant of 
options under terms comparable to those provided on options 
granted under the 1995 Plan except that all options are to be 
granted at a price not less than fair market value on the date 
of grant. Stock option activity under the Plans was as follows:

Under the 1998 Purchase Plan, eligible employees are allowed
to have salary withholdings of up to 10% of their base 
compensation to purchase shares of common stock at a price 
equal to 85% of the lower of the market value of the stock at 
the beginning or end of defined purchase periods. The initial 
purchase period commenced upon the initial public offering of 
the Company common stock in May 1998. In 1998, 40,403 shares 
were purchased by and distributed to employees at a price of 
$1020 per share. At December 31, 1998, $211,000 had been 
contributed by employees that will be used to purchase shares 
in 1999 at a price determined under the terms of the 1998 
Purchase Plan. At December 31, 1998, the Company had 209,597 
shares of its common stock reserved for future issuance under 
this plan.

Deferred Stock Compensation
As discussed in Note 1, the Company accounts for its stock-
based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in 
accordance with APB No. 25. Accordingly, the Company recorded 
deferred compensation expense equal to the difference between 
the grant price and deemed fair value of the Company common 
stock for options granted prior to December 31, 1997. Such 
deferred compensation expense aggregated $136,000 and is being 
amortized to expense over the four-year vesting period of the 
options.
Additional Stock Plan Information
Since the Company continues to account for its stock-based 
awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in 
accordance with APB No. 25, SFAS No. 123, Accounting for 
Stock-Based Compensation, requires the disclosure of pro 
forma net income loss and earnings loss per share had the 
Company adopted the fair value method as of the beginning of 
1995. Under SFAS 123, the fair value of stock-based awards to 
employees is calculated through the use of option pricing 
models, even though such models were developed to estimate the 
fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable options 
without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ from 
the Company stock option awards. These models also require 
subjective assumptions, including future stock price 
volatility and expected time to exercise, which greatly affect 
the calculated values. The Company fair value calculations 
on stock-based awards under the 1995 and 1998 Stock Plans were 
made using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the 
following weighted average assumptions: expected life, 5 years 
from the date of grant in 1996 and 1997 and 45 years from the 
date of grant in 1998; stock volatility, 0% in 1996 and 1997 
and 50% in 1998; risk-free interest rate, 675% in 1996 and 
1997 and 50% in 1998; and no dividends during the expected 
term. The Company calculations are based on a single option 
award valuation approach, and forfeitures are recognized as 
they occur. The Company fair value calculations on stock-
based awards under the 1998 Purchase Plan were also made using 
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following 
weighted average assumptions: expected life, six months; stock 
volatility, 50%; risk free interest rate, 50%; and no 
dividends during the expected term. If the computed fair 
values of the 1996, 1997 and 1998 awards had been amortized to 
expense over the vesting period of the awards, pro forma net 
loss would have been approximately $14,522,000 $767 per 
share, basic and diluted in 1996, $13,153,000 $619 per 
share, basic and diluted in 1997 and $14,454,000 $119 
per share, basic and diluted in 1998.

Total deferred tax assets             $    -    $    -
The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year
ended December 31, 1998 was a net increase of $6,920,000. The 
increase in the valuation allowance was primarily a result of 
increased net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
increased accruals and reserves not currently deductible and 
capitalized research and development costs generated in 1998 
which the Company provided a full valuation allowance against 
based on the Company evaluation of the likelihood of 
realization of future tax benefits resulting from the deferred 
tax assets.

As of December 31, 1998, the Company had available for 
carryforward net operating losses for federal and state income 
tax purposes of approximately $37,825,000 and $19,305,000, 
respectively. Net operating losses of $564,000 for federal and 
state tax purposes attributable to the tax benefit relating to 
the exercise of nonqualified stock options and disqualifying 
dispositions of incentive stock options are excluded from the 
components of deferred income tax assets. The tax benefit 
associated with this net operating loss will be recorded as an 
adjustment to stockholders' equity when the Company generates 
taxable income. Federal net operating loss carryforwards will 
expire if not utilized beginning in the years 2009 through 
2018. State net operating loss carryforwards will expire if 
not utilized beginning in the years 1999 through 2003.
As of December 31, 1998, the Company had available for 
carryforward research and experimental tax credits for federal 
and state income tax purposes of approximately $2,621,000 and 
$1,509,000, respectively. Federal research and experimentation 
tax credit carryforwards expire from 2009 through 2018. The 
Company also had approximately $307,000 in California 
manufacturers investment credits.
Current Federal and California tax laws include substantial 
restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and 
tax credits in the event of an ownership change of a 
corporation. Accordingly, the Company ability to utilize net 
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited as 
a result of such ownership change as defined. Such a 
limitation could result in the expiration of carryforwards 
before they are utilized.
9. Major Customers
Revenues for 1996 resulted from license fee revenue from one 
preferred stockholder.

10. Related Party Transactions
In March 1996, a preferred stockholder entered into a five-
year licensing agreement with the Company to license certain 
technology on a nonexclusive basis. Under the terms of this 
agreement: i the Company received a nonrefundable license 
fee of $1,000,000 in 1996 which accounted for all of 1996 
revenues, and ii if the Company met certain conditions in 
1997, it would be entitled to an additional $500,000 of 
nonrefundable license fees. In March 1997, the Company met 
such conditions and received additional nonrefundable license 
fees of $500,000 from this preferred stockholder. Such license 
fees were recognized as revenue in 1997. In addition, the 
Company also received prepaid royalties pursuant to the 
licensing agreement of $1,000,000 in 1997. Upon shipment of 
product incorporating the Company technology, $7,000 was 
recognized as license fee revenue in 1997; and the remaining 
$993,000 was recognized in 1998 as license fee revenue at the 
expiration of the royalty period on December 31, 1998. In 
April 1998, this preferred stockholder sold its entire 
interest in the Company to three other existing preferred 
stockholders.
