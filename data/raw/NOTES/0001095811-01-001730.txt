REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To BSQUARE Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BSQUARE
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of BSQUARE Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
BSQUARE Corporation, a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries
collectively the Company provides a variety of software products and services
that enable the creation and deployment of a wide variety of intelligent
computing devices based on Microsoft Windows-based operating systems. The
Company works with semiconductor vendors and original equipment manufacturers to
provide software products and engineering services for the development of
intelligent computing devices.
The Company helps enable the rapid and low-cost development of intelligent
computing devices by providing a variety of software products and services for
the design, integration and deployment of Windows-based operating systems with
industry-specific applications. The Company also develops software applications
that are licensed to original equipment manufacturers OEMs and end users to
provide intelligent computing devices with additional functionality. The Company
markets and supports its products and provides services on a worldwide basis
through a direct sales force augmented by distributors.
CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company operates in the software industry, and accordingly, can be
affected by a variety of factors. For example, management of the Company
believes that any of the following factors could have a significant negative
effect on the Company future financial position, results of operations and
cash flows: unanticipated fluctuations in quarterly operating results; failure
of the market for Windows CE operating system to develop fully; failure of the
market for intelligent computing devices to develop fully; adverse changes in
the Company relationship with Microsoft; failure to secure contracts with
market-leading original equipment manufacturers; intense competition; failure to
attract and retain key personnel; failure to protect intellectual property;
risks associated with international operations; inability to manage growth; and
litigation or other claims against the Company.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. Accounts denominated in foreign currencies
have been re-measured to the U.S. dollar from the functional currency.
On January 5, 2000, the Company acquired BlueWater Systems, Inc. in a
transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests. The consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto have been restated for all periods presented to
include the accounts and operations of BlueWater Systems, Inc. as if it had
always been a part of BSQUARE.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
128, Computation of Earnings Per Share, basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing net income available to common
41
42
BSQUARE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
shareholders net income less accretion of mandatorily redeemable convertible
preferred stock by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Dilutive earnings per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares
consist of the shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the
mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock using the if-converted
method and shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants
using the treasury stock method; common equivalent shares are excluded from
the calculation if their effect is antidilutive. The Company has not had any
issuances or grants for nominal consideration as defined under Staff Accounting
Bulletin 98.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits, money market accounts
and all highly liquid debt instruments with a purchased maturity date of three
months or less.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company short-term investments consist primarily of investment-grade
marketable securities, which are classified as held to maturity and recorded at
amortized cost. Due to the short- term nature of these investments, changes in
market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the fair value of
these securities that are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair
value.
At December 31, 1999 and 2000, all short-term investments had a contractual
maturity of two years or less.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company has the following financial instruments: cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, bank lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The
carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value
based on the liquidity of these financial instruments or based on their short
term nature. The carrying value of notes payable, bank lines of credit, and
standby letters of credit approximates fair value based on the market interest
rates available to the Company for debt of similar risk and maturities.
The Company performs initial and ongoing evaluations of its customers'
financial position, and generally extends credit on open account, requiring
collateral as deemed necessary. The Company maintains allowances for potential
credit losses.
FURNITURE, EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS
Furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives, as follows: office furniture and
equipment -- four years; computer equipment -- three years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
useful life. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When properties
are retired or otherwise disposed, gains or losses are reflected in the income
statement. When facts and circumstances indicate that the cost of long-lived
assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by
comparing the carrying value of the asset to projected future cash flows. Upon
indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, the
Company would recognize an impairment loss by a charge against current
operations.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
indentifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
a business combination accounted for under the purchase accounting method.
Goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized over their deemed useful
lives, ranging from two to seven years.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Under the criteria set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or
Otherwise Marketed, capitalization of software development costs begins upon
the establishment of technological feasibility of the product, which the Company
has defined as the completion of beta testing of a working product. The
establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the
recoverability of these costs require considerable judgment by management with
respect to certain external factors, including, but not limited to, anticipated
future gross product revenue, estimated economic life and changes in software
and hardware technology. Amounts that could have been capitalized under this
statement after consideration of the above factors were immaterial and,
therefore, no software development costs have been capitalized by the Company to
date.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
INCOME TAXES
The Company computes income taxes using the asset and liability method,
under which deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company assets
and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.
Accordingly, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense accounts at the
average exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are
recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The net gains and
losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in the
consolidated statements of income in the period incurred and were not
significant for any of the periods presented.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company revenue recognition policy is in compliance with the
provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement
of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. Service revenue is derived
from software porting and development contracts. Product revenue consists of
licensing fees from software application products and operating system and
software development tool products. The Company customers consist of software
companies, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users.
In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 101,
Revenue Recognition, which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to
recognize revenue and provides guidance for presentation
43
44
BSQUARE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in
financial statements filed with the SEC. The Company believes that it is in
compliance with the provisions of SAB 101.
Service revenue is derived from fees from professional services, porting
and development contracts, software maintenance and support contracts, and
customer training. Service revenue is recognized as follows   - Time and Material Consulting Contracts. The Company recognizes revenue as
services are rendered.
- Fixed-Price Consulting Contracts. Service revenue from fixed-price
contracts is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured
by the cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for the
contract. This method is used as management considers expended costs to
be the best available measure of contract performance. Contract costs
include all direct labor, material and any other costs related to
contract performance. Selling, general and administrative costs are
charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on
uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated
profitability may result in revisions in the estimate of total costs. Any
required adjustments due to these changes are recognized in the period in
which such revisions are determined.
- Software Maintenance Contracts. Software maintenance and support fees are
recognized ratably over the contract period.
- Customer Training. Service revenue from training is recognized when the
services are provided.
Product revenue consists of licensing fees from software development tool
products and operating system licenses and royalty fees from embedded system
run-time licenses. Product licensing fees, including advanced production royalty
payments, are generally recognized when a customer license agreement has been
executed, the software has been shipped, remaining obligations are insignificant
and collection of the resulting account receivable is probable. The Company

DEFERRED STOCK OPTION COMPENSATION
In connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees and
consultants during 1999, the Company recorded deferred stock option compensation
of $11 million, representing the difference between the estimated fair value of
the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of such
options at the date of grant. Such amount is presented as a reduction of
shareholders' equity and amortized, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No.
28, on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the applicable options
generally four years. During the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999, and
2000, the Company expensed approximately $171, $583, and $554, respectively. The
balance will be expensed over the period the options vest. Compensation expense
is decreased in the period of forfeiture for any accrued but unvested
compensation arising from the early termination of an option holder services.
Included in the expensed amounts noted above for the year ended December
31, 1999 is $30 related to options granted to a consultant for services
rendered. As of December 31, 1999, the consultant had earned 20,833 options to

MAINBRACE CORPORATION
On May 24, 2000, the Company acquired Mainbrace Corporation in a
transaction accounted for as a purchase. Mainbrace Corporation, located in
Sunnyvale, California, is a leading IP-licensing and enabling software firm
delivering product solutions to high volume market segments including set-top
boxes, Web-enabled phones, wireless thin clients, and electronic book readers.
Total consideration included the issuance of 627,334 shares of BSQUARE common
stock, and approximately $10,800 in cash. Additionally, the Company assumed
Mainbrace outstanding vested and unvested employee stock options, which were
converted into the right to acquire an additional 172,629 shares of the
Company common stock. Such assumption of Mainbrace options by the Company
had a fair market value of approximately $552.
A summary of the purchase price for the acquisition is as follows

over periods ranging from two to seven years.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the amount
allocated to in-process research and development, which was determined by an
independent valuation, has been recorded as a charge to

During 2000, the Company acquired two smaller companies, Embedded
Technologies, Inc. and ToolCraftKK, for total cash and stock consideration of
approximately $50 million. Both of these acquisitions were accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting, and the purchase prices were allocated to the
fair value of the acquired assets.
Additionally, the Company made several strategic investments during the
year ended December 31, 2000 totaling $49 million, which are reflected in
Investments in the accompanying balance sheets. These investments are included
in other assets and are accounted for under the cost method as our ownership is
less than 20% and we do not have significant influence. To the extent that the
capital stock held is in a public company and the securities have a quoted
market price, then the investment is marked to market. Our policy is to
regularly review the operating performance in assessing the carrying value of
the investment. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company has
certain rights to acquire approximately 791,000 shares of these entities under
certain conditions for additional consideration. We expect to continue to make
additional investments in the future.
