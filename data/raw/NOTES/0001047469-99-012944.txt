-31 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business and Basis of Presentation
Faroudja, Inc. the Company designs, develops and sells a range of video 
image enhancement products and technology for the home television, 
professional broadcast and personal computer markets. Although traditional 
business has been directed to sales of complete subsystem units, the Company 
has recently expanded its activities to include the design and development of 
board and chip level products for applications in the television as well as 
the personal computer markets.
The accompanying financial statements reflect the operations of Faroudja 
Laboratories, Inc. FLI and Faroudja Research Enterprises, Inc. FRE, 
both of which were California corporations. FLI and FRE, which were owned by 
common stockholders, were merged in December 1996, with FLI surviving the 
merger. Subsequently, in order to effect a reverse stock split and a 
reincorporation in Delaware, FLI merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of a 
newly formed Delaware corporation, Faroudja, Inc. In this transaction, the 
FLI stockholders received 069185 shares of the Company Common Stock for 
each share of FLI Common Stock held by them. 
All outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase FLI Common Stock were 
assumed by the Company at the same exchange ratio. The effect of this 
exchange on Common Stock, stock options and warrants has been reflected in 
the accompanying financial statements on a retroactive basis. All 
intercompany balances and transactions between the Company and FLI have been 
eliminated.
On December 30, 1996, FLI and FRE were merged through the exchange of 021258 
shares of FLI Common Stock for each outstanding share of FRE Common Stock. As 
the outstanding shares of both entities were held in the same percentage by 
identical stockholders prior to the merger, this transaction was accounted 
for as if it were a pooling-of-interests.
Prior to March 1996, FRE and FLI were each owned 100% by two individuals the 
Founders. In March 1996, new investors acquired a 5625% ownership 
interest in both entities through the purchase of shares held by the Founders 
for $14,000,000 and newly issued FLI shares for $4,000,000. Simultaneous 
with this transaction, the Founders received a distribution from FLI in the 
amount of $4,000,000. The new investors also acquired an option from the 
Founders to acquire an additional 1,537,500 shares held by the Founders for a 
total of $6,000,000. Such option was exercised on September 5, 1997. Prior to 
the March 1996 transaction, FLI had elected to be treated as an S Corporation 
for income tax purposes. FRE was a C Corporation for income tax purposes.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying 
notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Sources of Supply
The Company currently relies on a limited number of independent foundries to 
manufacture, assemble and test all of its semiconductor components and 
products. In addition, the Company subcontracts the manufacturing of its 
broadcast and television products with two principal suppliers. While 
alternate sources of supply exist, in the event of the discontinuance of any 
of the above supplier relationships, the Company would be required to locate 
and qualify new suppliers, which could take several months.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three 
months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents 
consist primarily of deposits in banks, money market accounts, commercial 
paper and discount notes.
Short-Term Investments
The Company accounts for its short-term investments in accordance with 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain 
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS 115.
Under SFAS 115, all affected debt and equity securities must be stated at 
fair value and classified as held-to-maturity, trading or available-for-sale. 
Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the 
time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet 
date.
At December 31, 1998 and 1997, all debt and equity securities were designated 
as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair 
value, with unrealized gains and losses reported net of tax as part of 
accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. Realized 
gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary, if 
any, on available-for-sale securities are
-32 included in other income. The cost of securities sold is based on the 
specific identification method. Interest on securities classified as 
available-for-sale is included in interest income.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company sells its products primarily through a network of distributors, 
dealers and through original equipment manufacturing OEM arrangements. 
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and 
generally does not require collateral. Uncollectible accounts receivable have 
not been significant in any period presented.
At December 31, 1998, seven customers accounted for 45% of the accounts 
receivable balance, including one customer that accounted for 22% of the 
accounts receivable balance.
At December 31, 1997 four customers accounted for 45% of the accounts 
receivable balance and no other single customer accounted for more than 10% 
of the Company ending accounts receivable balance.
Inventories
Raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventories are stated at 
the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost or market value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization 
are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives 
of the assets ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are 
amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life. 
Depreciation expense was $745,000, $540,000 and $249,000 for 1998, 1997 and 
1996, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
Sales revenue is recognized upon shipment of products to customers net of 
discounts, rebates and allowances. The Company does not grant rights of 
return. Non-refundable minimum royalties are recognized as revenue in the 
period to which they relate.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense 
amounted to $374,000, $430,000 and $395,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, 
respectively.
Financing Expense
In 1997, the Company incurred and expensed approximately $312,000 of expenses 
related to financing activities.
Stock-Based Compensation
As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, the Company has 
elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for 
Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related interpretations in 
accounting for its employee and director stock option and purchase plans. 
Under APB 25, if the exercise price of the Company employee stock options 
is not less than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of 
grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Net Income Loss Per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number 
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share 
also gives effect to the dilutive effect of stock options and warrants 
calculated based on the treasury stock method. A reconciliation of shares 
used in the calculation follows                                  1998      1997      1996
Weighted average shares outstanding               12,145,781   9,040,616   7,976,892
Dilutive effect of stock options and warrants              -    833,942    214,411

Options and warrants to purchase 1,991,905 and 445,200 shares of the 
Company common stock would have been anti-dilutive in 1998 and 1997, 
respectively and were, therefore, excluded from the respective diluted 
calculation.                    -33 Comprehensive Income Loss
As of January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standard No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS 130. SFAS 130 
establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income 
and its components; however, the adoption of this Statement had no impact on 
the Company net income or stockholders' equity. SFAS 130 requires 
unrealized gains or losses on the Company available-for-sale securities, 
which prior to adoption, were reported separately in stockholders' equity, to 
be included in comprehensive income. Prior year financial statements have 
been reclassified to conform to the requirement of SFAS 130.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Effective January 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related 
Information SFAS 131, which established revised standards for the 
reporting of financial and descriptive information about operating segments 
in financial statements. The Company has determined that it operates in only 
one segment, which is the development, manufacture and supply of video image 
enhancement technology.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Financial 
Instruments and for Hedging Activities SFAS 133 which provides a 
comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of 
derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 133 is effective for years beginning 
after June 15, 1999 and is not anticipated to have an impact on the Company 
results of operations or financial condition when adopted.

6. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Initial Public Offering
In October 1997 the Company sold a total of 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock 
at $600 per share through its initial public offering. Net proceeds, after 
underwriters' discounts, commissions and fees, and other costs associated 
with the offering, totaled $15,588,006. In connection with the offering, S3 
Incorporated S3 received an additional 307,018 shares of Common Stock 
pursuant to certain anti-dilution provisions which the Company had granted 
under a Stock Purchase Agreement see Note 7.
Warrants
In 1996, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 65,152 shares of Common 
Stock at an exercise price of $015 to a limited liability company in which a 
member of the Company Board of Directors has a substantial interest. The 
warrant was issued in exchange for services to be performed by the director. 
As of December 31, 1998, 21,718 shares under the warrant were exercisable. 
The remaining 43,434 shares will become exercisable if certain defined events 
occur prior to February 1999. The warrant expires on December 31, 1999. The 
Company is expensing $222,000, the value of the warrant, over the related 
service period.
-35 In 1997, one of the Founders granted to the Company an exclusive excluding 
certain rights retained by the Founder, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable 
and royalty-free right and license to patents owned by him. The Founder has a 
nonexclusive, nontransferable right to the patents for applications and uses 
outside of the Company business as defined in the license agreement. In 
exchange for rights granted, the Founder received a warrant to purchase 
100,000 shares of Common Stock at $750 per share. The warrant vests over a 
three-year period and expires in January 2002. The Company is amortizing 
$250,000, the value of the warrant, over the estimated useful economic life 
of the patents.
Stock Plans
In 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan. A 
total of 1,700,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance under 
the 1995 Plan. In January 1997, the Board of Directors adopted, and the 
stockholders approved, the 1997 Performance Stock Option Plan the 1997 
Plan. The 1997 Plan succeeds the 1995 Plan and has terms similar to that 
Plan. No additional options will be granted under the 1995 Plan and shares 
reserved for future option grants thereunder are available for grant under 
the terms of the 1997 Plan. In June 1997, the Board of Directors adopted and 
the stockholders' approved an amendment to the 1997 Plan increasing the 
number of shares reserved for issuance by 250,000 shares. Under the terms of 
the 1997 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant options to directors, 
employees and consultants. Options may be either incentive stock options or 
nonstatutory stock options, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. 
Incentive stock options may be granted to employees with exercise prices of 
no less than the fair value and nonstatutory options may be granted to 
employees, directors, and consultants with exercise prices of no less than 
85% of the fair value, of the Common Stock on the date of grant, as 
determined by the Board of Directors. If, at the time of grant, the optionee 
owns stock possessing 10% or more of the voting power of all classes of 
stock, the option price shall be at least 110% of the fair value, and the 
option shall not be exercised more than five years after the date of grant. 
Except as noted above, options expire ten years after the date of grant, or 
earlier if employment or service is terminated. Options become exercisable as 
determined by the Board of Directors. Options generally vest over three or 
four years.
In December 1996, the Board of Directors adopted, and in 1997 the 
stockholders approved, the 1997 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the 
Directors Plan. A total of 100,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved 
for issuance pursuant to the terms of the Directors Plan, which provides for 
the grant of nonqualified stock options to nonemployee directors of the 
Company.
In January 1997, the Board of Directors adopted, and the stockholders 
approved, the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan. A 
total of 400,000 shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase 
Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase Common Stock 
through payroll deductions at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the fair 
value of the Company Common Stock at the beginning or end of the applicable 
offering period. Payroll deductions are at the election of the employee 
subject to a maximum of 10% of the employee salary. In 1998, 41,223 shares 
were issued under the Purchase Plan. There were no shares issued in 1997.
During 1996, the Company adopted SFAS 123. In accordance with the Statement, 
the Company applies APB 25 in accounting for option grants to employees under 
the Plan and, accordingly, does not recognize compensation expense for 
options granted to employees with exercise prices of not less than fair value 
on the date of grant.

recognized as deferred compensation expense the excess of the deemed value 
for financial reporting purposes of the Common Stock issuable upon the 
exercise of such options over the aggregate exercise price of such options. 
The total deferred compensation expense of $272,000 is being amortized over 
the vesting period of such options.

the provisions of SFAS 123, pro forma net income and basic net income per 
share would have been as follows in thousands except per share data                                December 31,

The value of options granted prior to the Company initial public offering 
were determined using the minimum value method using the following weighted 
average assumptions in 1997: a risk free interest rate of 563%, an expected 
option life of 72 months and no dividends. The value of options granted 
following the initial public offering in 1997 were determined using the 
Black-Scholes method and the weighted average assumptions were as follows: an 
expected volatility factor of 07764, a risk free interest rate of 563%, an 
expected option life of 72 months and no dividends. 
-37 The value of options granted in 1998 were determined using the Black-Scholes 
method and the weighted average assumptions were as follows: an expected 
volatility factor of 066, a risk free interest rate of 546%, an expected 
option life of 48 months and no dividends.
Reclassification
In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting 
Bulletin Topic 4.B., the Company reclassified $495,000 from retained earnings 
to paid-in capital to reflect the undistributed accumulated earnings of 
Faroudja Laboratories, Inc. There was no impact on total stockholders' equity 
as a result of this reclassification.
7. LICENSE AGREEMENT
In March 1997, the Company entered into a license agreement with S3 
Incorporated covering the incorporation of the Company video processing 
technologies into integrated circuits for use in PCs. Portions of the license 
were exclusive for certain markets for a period of five years provided that 
performance criteria, including minimum license fees, were satisfied. S3 made 
no minimum license payments necessary to maintain its exclusive rights with 
respect to any periods after March 31, 1998. There can be no assurance as to 
the amount of royalties, if any, the Company will receive in the future as 
the Company does not currently have any license agreements in effect pursuant 
to which it expects to receive substantial royalties.
In December 1996, S3 paid the Company $1 million, $500,000 of which was 
refundable if a definitive license agreement between the parties was not 
consummated. Accordingly, the Company recognized $500,000 of license and 
royalty revenue in 1996 and the remaining $500,000 in March 1997.
On June 30, 1997, the Company sold a total of 526,316 shares of its Common 
Stock to S3 pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement for $4,948,200, net of 
expenses associated with the transaction. S3 was entitled to certain 
anti-dilution, registration and other rights as set forth in the Stock 
Purchase Agreement. As a result of the anti-dilution rights, S3 received an 
additional 307,018 shares of Common Stock upon completion of the Company 
initial public offering in October 1997.

The pro forma provision for income taxes in 1996 reflects the additional tax 
expense which would have been incurred had FLI status as an S Corporation 
terminated on January 1, 1996, exclusive of the effects of the establishment 
of deferred tax assets and liabilities at that date.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant 
components of the Company deferred tax liabilities and assets are as 
follows in thousands                                   December 31,

As of December 31, 1998, the Company had state tax loss carryforwards of 
approximately $1,800,000 and federal tax credit carryforwards of 
approximately $151,000. The state tax loss carryforwards will expire in 2003, 
and the federal tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2018, if not 
utilized. Because of the change in ownership provisions of the Internal 
Revenue Code, a portion of the Company net operating loss and tax credit 
carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations. The annual limitation 
may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit 
carryforwards before utilization.
Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, if any, 
the timing and the amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, a valuation 
allowance, in an amount equal to the net deferred tax asset as of December 
31, 1998 has been established to reflect these uncertainties. The valuation 
allowance increased by approximately $822,000 during the fiscal year ended 
December 31, 1998. The Company will continue to evaluate the realization of 
the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.

During 1994, the Company adopted a defined contribution retirement plan under 
Internal Revenue Service Code Section 401k. Employees are eligible, 
following one month of employment, to contribute a specified percentage of 
their salary, not to exceed the statutory limit, to the plan. The Company 
matches a percentage of employee contributions. The Company contributions 
were $166,000 in 1998, $147,000 in 1997 and were insignificant during 1996.

In March 1997, the Company established a revolving line of credit with a bank

agreement, which includes certain financial covenants, expires in April 1999. 
Borrowings under the line of credit are collaterized by substantially all of 
the Company tangible assets and contract rights and are limited to a 
defined percentage of eligible accounts receivable. In addition, the Company 
must satisfy certain financial covenants. Borrowings against the line of 
credit bear interest at prime plus 15% equivalent to 925% at December 31, 
1998. At December 31, 1998, there were no borrowings against the line of 
credit.
