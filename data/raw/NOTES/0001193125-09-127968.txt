Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of
consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries
the Company. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Headquartered in Addison, Texas, the Company markets factory-built homes nationwide through vertically integrated operations, encompassing
factory-built housing, financing and insurance. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used by
management in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. General Business Environment The Companys results for fiscal 2009 were heavily influenced by the severe state of the factory-built housing industry, the weakness in the overall
housing market and the prevailing economic uncertainties and credit crisis. There was a drastic slowdown in demand for factory-built housing products and decline in retail traffic during fiscal 2009. Industry shipments for calendar year 2008
through November were down approximately 14% from the prior years already historically low levels. The three significant to both the Company and the industry manufactured housing states of Florida, California and Arizona were down a
combined 41%. Consumer concerns about the economy and the lack of available credit are keeping potential homebuyers on the sidelines; therefore affecting the demand for factory-built housing. While the Company expects these conditions to worsen and
the Companys performance to improve in fiscal 2010, the Company is likely to still incur a net loss. The Company continues to take
actions to further reduce its operating costs in response to current conditions and expected demand. The Company idled one production line in Martinsville, Virginia during the second quarter, another production line in Austin, Texas during the third
quarter and another production line in Siler City, North Carolina during the fourth quarter. The Company is taking additional steps to further reduce its selling, general and administrative expenses, increase margins and further reduce its
receivables and inventory levels. The Company believes that this will better position it to sustain a prolonged downturn and benefit from any upside in demand when it occurs. With the decline in retail demand, the Company has focused on new areas of business, including commercial and military projects, which present new
revenue opportunities for it. These institutions are looking for a quality provider and the Company is well positioned as a preferred supplier to meet this demand. During fiscal 2009, the Company produced barracks and other housing for three
military bases. In light of the current economic crisis and with no near-term signs of recovery for the factory-built housing industry,
the Companys top priorities are cash generation and cash preservation in every area of its business. During fiscal 2009, the Company focused on these priorities through the following:  The Company sold $513 million of CountryPlaces warehoused portfolio of chattel and mortgage loans for a gain of $13 million. The Company used the proceeds
to repay in full and terminate the warehouse borrowing facility scheduled to expire on April30, 2008.  Through CountryPlace, the Company obtained a $100 million construction lending line to use for financing mortgage loans. 
43 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued  The Company completed two sale leaseback transactions totaling $65 million in cash for 13 of its retail properties.  The Company retired $212 million of its convertible senior notes for $106 million of cash, resulting in a gain of $106 million and lower interest costs.
The Company closed three less-than-efficient manufacturing facilities and one retail sales center.  The Company reduced inventories by $262 million and receivables by $82 million.  The Company has continued to reduce its overhead costs and employed other cash management steps.  The Company accomplished all the above and still funded $20 million in committed pipeline loans from working capital when its warehouse lender exited the business.
The Company has been working with a financial advisor to leverage $100 million of its unlevered assets. For the near term, the outlook for housing, both site-built and factory-built, remains extremely challenging. A number of issues must be resolved for any
recovery to gain traction, and until inventories decline, housing prices stabilize, credit is restored and general economic fundamentals improve, the Company does not expect any short-term improvement. In the meantime, the Companys strategy is
to manage its operations more efficiently and become a stronger and leaner company. Accordingly, the Company remains focused on three critical areas in its business for fiscal 2010. The Companys top priority is to manage its cash and leverage
its balance sheet to maintain adequate liquidity through this uncertain business climate. The Company is also streamlining its operations to reduce both marginal costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, consistent with expected
revenues. And finally, the Company continues to look for new sources of revenue by pursuing its creative efforts like flexible products, commercial and military modular products, and targeted Internet marketing strategies. Regardless of market
conditions, the Company will continue to leverage its core strengthsthe most trusted brand name in the industry, a diverse and high-quality product line, manufacturing excellence and exceptional customer service. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Companys floor plan lender, Textron Financial Corporation Textron, announced that they are in the
process of an orderly liquidation of certain commercial loan business including their housing finance business. As further discussed in Note 5, in April 2009, the Company agreed to an amendment to its floor plan facility which includes a lower total
commitment amount from $70 million to $50 million, a new expiration date of March31, 2010, new interest rates and new financial covenants. In addition, as discussed in Note 5, the Company agreed to a further amendment dated June4,
2009, which extends the expiration date to June30, 2010, among other things. The Company was in compliance with its new financial
covenants as of March27, 2009. In addition, management believes that new quarterly financial covenants covering maximum net loss before taxes levels, annualized inventory turn and maximum borrowing base, all as defined in the recent
amendments, for fiscal 2010 are achievable based upon the Companys fiscal 2010 operating plan. Management has also identified other actions within their control that could be implemented, as necessary, to help the Company meet these quarterly
requirements. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful. Additionally, in light of market conditions, it is
possible that the Company may be unable to comply with the new financial covenants during fiscal 2010. Textron could also declare a loan violation due to a material adverse change, as defined in the agreement. As a result, if a loan violation were
to occur and not be remedied in accordance with the terms of the floor plan facility, Textron could declare an event of default and demand that the full amount of the facility be paid in full prior to maturity. Such a demand would result in, among
other things, a cross default of the Companys convertible senior notes described in Note 6. 
44 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
While the Company is currently exploring asset sales and other types of capital raising alternatives
in order to generate liquidity, there can be no assurance that such activities will be successful or generate cash resources adequate to fully retire the Textron floor plan facility at maturity. In this event, there can be no assurance that Textron
will consent to a further amendment of the floor plan facility agreement. Year End The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Friday in March. The Companys financial services subsidiaries fiscal year ends on different
dates than the Companys. CountryPlaces fiscal year ends on March31 and Standard Casualtys Standard fiscal year ends on the last day of February. Revenue recognition Retail sales of manufactured homes and certain single story modular homes,
including shipping charges, are recognized when a down payment is received, the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract, title has transferred and the home is accepted by the customer, delivered and permanently located at the
customers site. Sales of the Companys commercial buildings, including shipping charges, are recognized when the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract, title has transferred and the home is substantially complete and
accepted by the customer. Additionally, for retail sales of all multi-story modular homes, Nationwide modular homes, and manufactured homes in which the Company serves as the general contractor with respect to virtually all aspects of the sale and
construction process, sales are not recognized until after final consumer closing. Transportation costs, unless borne by the retail customer or independent retailer, are included in cost of sales. Interest income on consumer loans receivable is recognized as net sales on an accrual basis. When CountryPlace determines that a loan held for investment
is partially or fully uncollectible, the estimated loss is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance at the time the recovery is collected. Loan origination
fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized into net sales over the contractual life of the loan using the interest method. Most of the homes sold to independent retailers are financed through standard industry arrangements which include repurchase agreements see Note 11. The Company extends credit in the normal course of business under
normal trade terms and its receivables are subject to normal industry risk. Premium income from insurance policies is recognized on an as
earned basis. Premium amounts collected are amortized into net sales over the life of the policy. Policy acquisition costs are also amortized as cost of sales over the life of the policy. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents
are all liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.

financing costs, net of amortization. Loans held for an investment and loans securitized are stated at the aggregate remaining unpaid principal balances. Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market on an aggregate basis. Interest
income is recognized based upon the unpaid principal amount outstanding. As of March27, 2009 and March28, 2008, the Company
had $11 million and $513 million of loans held for sale, respectively. These loans were transferred from loans held for investment to loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair market value. See Note 4 for more information. Loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the portfolio and amortized using the effective interest method. 
Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan
losses reflects CountryPlaces judgment of the probable loss exposure on their loan portfolio as of the end of the reporting period. CountryPlaces loan portfolio is comprised of loans related primarily to factory-built Palm Harbor homes.
The allowance for loan losses is developed at a portfolio level and not allocated to specific individual loans or to impaired loans. A range of probable losses is calculated after giving consideration to, among other things, the composition of the
loan portfolio, including historical loss experience by static pool, expected probable losses based on industry knowledge of losses for a given range of borrower credit scores, the composition of the portfolio by credit score and seasoning, and
recent loss experience. CountryPlace then makes a determination of the best estimate within the range of loan losses. The accrual of
interest is discontinued when either principal or interest is more than 120 days past due. In addition, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the borrower has the inability or unwillingness to meet payments as
they become due. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied first to accrued interest and then to principal. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible. As of March31, 2009, CountryPlace management
was not aware of any potential problem loans that would have a material effect on loan delinquency or charge-offs. The portion of the loan
portfolio with payments delinquent sixty-one or more days has increased to 209% at March31, 2009 from 100% at March31, 2008. CountryPlace management believes this increase is attributable primarily to two factors: 1 anticipated
increases expected with the aging of the portfolio; and 2 deterioration in general economic conditions, including increasing levels of unemployment and continued house-price depreciation in certain states. 
46 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
Based on prior experience with factory-built home loan performance, CountryPlace management expects
the incidence of defaults to increase as loans age for the first three to six years of a portfolio life, and then decrease in later years. The weighted average remaining contractual life of the portfolio increased from 29 months at March31,
2008 to 46 months at March31, 2009. This age difference includes the effect of the April, 2008 sale of $513 million of loans receivable which had a weighted average age of 6 months. House price depreciation and economic weakness has continued to adversely affect the rates of delinquency and default in mortgage loan portfolios.
California, Florida, and Arizona have been especially affected. With the exception of a 426% concentration of loans receivable in Texas, CountryPlaces loan portfolio is well diversified across 27 states. Accordingly, CountryPlaces
exposure to isolated local or regional economic downturns is, in normal conditions, offset by more favorable economic conditions in other states. To date, Texas has performed better than in other states in the current economic downturn and
CountryPlaces loans receivable concentration in Texas has offset the effects of economic weakness in other states. The portion of CountryPlaces loans receivable in Texas that were 61 days or more past due at March31, 2009 was
127%, or 082% lower than the delinquency rate for the total loans receivable portfolio. The portion of CountryPlaces loans
receivable in Florida that were past due sixty-one days or more at March31, 2009 increased to 351% from 151% at March31, 2008. While loans receivable in Florida represented 71% of CountryPlaces total loans receivable at
March31, 2009, Florida loans receivable past due 61 days or more represented 025% of total loans receivable at March31, 2009, up from 010% at March31, 2008. With the exception of Florida, delinquency performance for the
Companys loans receivable in the three states most severely affected by house price depreciation indicates that the effects of declining house prices in these states in general has had little or no discernable effect to date on the overall
performance of CountryPlaces loans receivable portfolio. Delinquent accounts in Arizona and California represent 014% and 006%, respectively, of the total loans receivable balance. Deteriorating performance of mortgage loans in general has been driven, in large part, by product features such as adjustable rates, interest-only
payments, payment options, etc. that have a high propensity to induce payment shock or negative equity, and underwriting practices which relied on the expectation of continuous house price appreciation. CountryPlaces portfolio is comprised
entirely of fixed-rate, full-amortizing loans. CountryPlaces underwriting practices and risk management policies have been based on an assumption that the manufactured home collateral would depreciate, rather than appreciate, in value over the
life of the loan. Accordingly, its credit standards are based on both the borrowers capacity to repay the loan as scheduled, and the borrowers history of satisfying repayment obligations. As a result, CountryPlace management believes the
portfolio is less susceptible to defaults due to adjustable interest rate resets and default losses, since house price depreciation has always been considered in determining CountryPlaces allowance for loan losses. Allowance for loan losses as of March31, 2009 was $58 million, or approximately 29% of the $2030 million total consumer loans receivable and
construction advances balance. The Company believes this allowance is adequate for expected loan losses, considering the geographic and loan-type concentrations of the portfolio, the age and remaining life of the portfolio, expected overall future
credit losses, and recent delinquency experience by geographic area and type of loan collateral. Transfers of Financial Assets CountryPlace completed two securitizations of factory-built housing loan receivables both of which were accounted for as financings, which use the
portfolio method of accounting in accordance with FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of
Leases, where 1loan contracts are securitized 
47 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
and accounted for as borrowings; 2interestincome is recorded over the life of the loans using the interest method; 3the loan contracts
receivable and the securitization debtasset-backed certificates remain on CountryPlaces balance sheet; and 4the related interest margin is reflected in the income statement. The securitizations include provisions for removal of
accounts by CountryPlace and other factors that preclude sale accounting of the securitizations under SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. The structure of CountryPlaces securitizations have no effect on the ultimate amount of profit and cash flow recognized over the life of
theloan contracts, except to the extent of surety fees and premiums, trustee fees, backup servicer fees, and securitization issuance costs. However, the structure does affect the timing of cash receipts. CountryPlace services the loan contracts under pooling and servicing agreements with the securitization trusts. CountryPlace also retains interests in
subordinate classes of securitization bonds that provide over-collateralization credit enhancement to senior certificate holders and are subject to risk of loss of interest payments and principal. As is common insecuritizations, CountryPlace
is also liable for customary representations. The Company guarantees certain aspects of CountryPlaces performance as the servicer under the 2005-1 securitization pooling and servicing agreement. Investment Securities Management determines the
appropriate classification of its investment securities at the time of purchase. The Companys investments include marketable debt and equity securities that are held as available-for-sale. All investments classified as available-for-sale are
recorded at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, net of tax if applicable. Realized gains and losses from the sale of securities are determined using the specific identification
method. Management regularly makes an assessment to determine whether a decline in value of an individual security is
other-than-temporary. The Company considers the following factors when making its assessment: 1the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity, or a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value;
2whether it is probable that the Company will be able to collect the amounts contractually due; and 3whether any decision has been made to dispose of the investment prior to the balance sheet date. Investments on which there is an
unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the loss recorded in earnings losses. Inventories 
Raw materials inventories are valued at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. Finished goods are valued at the lower of
cost or market, using the specific identification method. Each quarter the Company assesses the recoverability of its inventory by
comparing the carrying amount to its estimated net realizable value. Raw materials consist of home building materials and supplies and turn approximately 3 times per month. Finished goods consist of homes completed under customer order and homes
available for purchase at the Companys retail sales centers. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its finished homes by comparing its inventory cost to its estimated sales price, less costs to sell. The sales price is estimated by
product type HUD code and modular. Approximately 40% of the Companys inventory is located in Texas, where the factory-built housing business has not experienced the same declines as California and Florida. Historically, the amount of its
inventory valuation adjustments has been immaterial. Management is not aware of any trends or other factors that are reasonably likely to result in valuation adjustments in future periods. 
48 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
These valuations are significantly impacted by estimated average selling prices, average sales rates and product type. The quarterly assessments reflect
managements estimates, which management believes are reasonable. However, based on the general economic conditions, future results could differ materially from managements judgments and estimates. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and
equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease period or the
improvements useful lives. Estimated useful lives for significant classes of assets are as follows: Land Improvements 10-15 years, Buildings and Improvements 3-30 years, and Machinery and Equipment 2-10 years. The Company had depreciation
expense of $54 million, $71 million and $84 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The recoverability of property, plant and equipment is evaluated whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value or projected undiscounted cash flows. The Company evaluated its property, plant and equipment for
impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no impairment charges were necessary. The Company recorded $06 million for impairment charges in fiscal 2008 and none in 2007. Assets held for sale During fiscal 2008, management
committed to sell three manufacturing facilities with a carrying amount of $75 million and determined that the plan of sale criteria in FASB Statement No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, had
been met. As a result of deteriorating market conditions in fiscal 2009, the properties were not sold and continue to be classified as held for sale. However, the Company continues to actively market these properties and have reduced the selling
prices to respond to the current market conditions. The Company has entered into an agreement to sell one of the facilities no later than the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and plan for the remaining two facilities to be sold by the end of
fiscal 2010. The carrying value of the production equipment was adjusted to its fair value less costs to sell, amounting to $57 million, which was determined based on third-party appraisals. A $15 million impairment loss has been recorded as an
adjustment to the valuation allowance. The carrying value of the facilities that are held for sale is separately presented in the Assets Held for Sale caption in the consolidated balance sheets and is reported under the factory-built
housing segment. Goodwill Goodwill
represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company tests goodwill annually for potential impairment by reporting unit as of the first
day of its fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurred or circumstances changed that indicated the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. Due to the difficult market environment and the losses incurred during fiscal
2007 and early 2008, the Company, with the assistance of an independent valuation firm, performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis in fiscal 2008 and concluded that the goodwill relating to its factory-built housing reporting unit was
impaired. As a result, during the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $785 million to fully impair the goodwill related to its factory-built housing segment. Goodwill totaling $22 million at both March27, 2009 and March28, 2008 relates to the Companys minority interest purchase of the
remaining 20% of CountryPlace in fiscal 2008 and is included in prepaids and other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheets.

Warranties Products are warranted against manufacturing defects for a period of one year commencing at the time of sale to the retail customer. Estimated costs relating to product warranties are provided at the date of sale.
Income taxes Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. To the
extent the Company believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized prior to expiration, it is required to establish a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax assets.
The determination of valuation allowances involves significant management judgments and is based upon the evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including the Companys best estimates of anticipated taxable profits in the various
jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated. Changes in events or expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to the Companys provision for income taxes. 
Due to the difficult market environment and the losses incurred during fiscal 2007 and early 2008, the Company reviewed its deferred tax assets during
fiscal 2008 to determine whether a valuation allowance was necessary. In fiscal 2008, the Company recognized a valuation allowance of $319 million against all of its net deferred tax assets which resulted in the Company recording an income tax
provision of approximately $138 million. In fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an additional $149 million valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in fiscal 2009 and an income tax benefit of $8,000. If, after future
considerations of positive and negative evidence related to the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, the Company determines a lesser allowance is required, it would record a reduction to income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the
period of such determination. Other Income Other income totals $21 million, $36 million and $49 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In fiscal 2009, other income consists of $07 million of interest income, $07 million of income earned on a real estate investment
and $07 million of income earned from mortgage lending. In fiscal 2008, other income consists of $30 million of interest income, $04 million of income earned from mortgage lending and $03 million of income earned on a real estate investment. In
fiscal 2007, other income consists of $44 million in interest income and $03 million of gain on the sale of available-for-sale investments. Accumulated other comprehensive income loss Accumulated other comprehensive income loss is comprised of unrealized
gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and changes in fair value of an interest rate hedge. New Accounting Pronouncement In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion
Including Partial Cash Settlement. FSP APB 14-1 specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt
borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. In addition, transaction costs incurred with third parties that directly relate to the issuance of convertible debt instruments shall be allocated to the liability and equity
components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and accounted for as debt and equity issuance costs, respectively. The provisions of FSP APB 14-1 shall be applied retrospectively to all periods presented when adopted. The provisions of FSP
APB 14-1 are 
50 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
effective for the Companys 325% convertible notes on March28, 2009, the beginning of its fiscal year 2010. The Company is currently evaluating
the effects of FSP APB 14-1 on its consolidated financial statements. However, while the Companys cash payments for interest on the 325% convertible notes will not be affected, based upon current amounts outstanding, the Company expects that
upon adoption it will have higher annual interest expense through May 2011. Additionally, as the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 is retrospective, non-cash adjustments to increase interest expense in prior periods will be reflected in future filings, along
with corresponding non-cash adjustments to record the unamortized portion of a debt discount on its 325% convertible notes, reduce retained earnings, increase additional paid-in capital, and reflect related income tax effects, as appropriate.

and a realized loss of $04 million was recorded in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The Company does not believe
that the remaining unrealized losses on its available-for-sale investments are other than temporary as 1the Company has the ability and intent to hold the investments to maturity, or a period of time sufficient to allow for a
recovery in market value and, 2it is probable that the Company will be able to collect the amounts contractually due as it has not identified any credit concerns on these securities. The Company has no non-agency mortgage related securities

CountryPlaces policy is to place loans on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest
is past due and remains unpaid for 120 days or more. In addition, they place loans on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the borrower has the inability or unwillingness to meet payments as they become due. At March31,
2009, CountryPlaces management was not aware of any potential problem loans that would have a material effect on loan delinquency or charge-offs. Loans are subject to continual review and are given managements attention whenever a
problem situation appears to be developing. The following table sets forth the amounts and categories of CountryPlaces non-performing loans and assets as of March31, 2009 and March31, 2008 dollars in thousands:  March31,2009 March31,2008 Non-performing loans Loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis 2,574 2,026 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more 390 244 Total nonaccrual and 90 days past due loans 2,964 2,270 Percentage of total loans 149 083 Other non-performing assets1 2,048 1,635 Troubled debt restructurings 5,013  1
Consists of land and homes acquired through foreclosure, which is carried at fair value less estimated selling expenses, and is included in prepaid and other assets on the
consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2009, CountryPlace modified loans to retain borrowers with good payment
history.These modifications were considered to represent credit concessions due to hurricane and other repayment matters such as employment/financial stress impacting these borrowers.At March31, 2009, CountryPlace has modified
approximately $50 million of loans where principal and interest payments have been deferred or waived for periods ranging from one to three months.These loans are not reflected as non-performing loans but as troubled debt
restructurings.As of March31, 2009, the allowance for loan losses totaled $58 million of which $01 million is an impairment allowance for these loans. Loan contracts secured by collateral that is geographically concentrated could experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and foreclosure losses than loan contracts secured by collateral that is more
geographically dispersed. CountryPlace has loan contracts secured by factory-built homes located in the following key states as of March31, 2009 and March31, 2008:  March31,2009 March31,2008 Texas
426 410 Arizona

The states of California, Florida and Arizona, and to a lesser degree Texas, have experienced
economic weakness resulting from the decline in real estate values. The risks created by these concentrations have been considered by CountryPlaces management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. No other
states had concentrations in excess of 10% of the principal balance of the consumer loans receivable as of March31, 2009 or March31, 2008. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover estimated losses at
March31, 2009.

Floor plan payable The Company has an agreement
with Textron for a floor plan facility. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, Textron announced that they are in the process of an orderly liquidation of certain of their commercial finance businesses, including their housing inventory finance
business. On April28, 2009 with an effective date of January26, 2009, the Company agreed to an amendment which includes the following modifications: a new committed amount of $50 million reduced from $70 million which will gradually
be reduced to $40 million by December31, 2009, a new facility expiration date of March31, 2010, a new interest rate of LIBOR plus 700%, and new financial covenants. The new financial covenants the Company had to comply with as of
March27, 2009 were a maximum quarterly net loss before taxes of $15 million, a minimum annualized inventory turn of 275, and a maximum borrowing base requirement of 60% of eligible finished goods inventory. For the remaining quarters of
fiscal 2010, the maximum net loss before taxes covenant requirement is reduced to $10 million. The facility has an advance rate of 90% of manufacturers invoice and is principally secured by new home inventory and a portion of receivables from
financial institutions. As of March27, 2009 and March28, 2008, the Company had $494 million and $594 million, respectively, outstanding under the floor plan credit facility. The Company agreed to a further amendment dated June4, 2009, which includes the following:  extends the expiration date to June30, 2010,  lowers the committed amount from $50 million to $45 million and further lowers it to $40 million upon the earlier of the sale of certain assets or December31,
2009,  alters the maximum quarterly net loss before taxes covenant to exclude any interest expense reflected on the financial statements due to 2009 accounting changes,
and  requires a prepayment of principal equal to any amounts of cash and cash equivalents greater than $20 million as of March31, 2010 no later than the earlier of
10 business days after the closing of the Companys fiscal quarter ending March31, 2010 or April30, 2010. The Company was in compliance with its new financial covenants as of March27, 2009. In addition, management believes that new quarterly financial covenants covering maximum net loss before taxes levels, annualized inventory turn and
maximum borrowing base, all as defined in the recent amendments, for fiscal 2010 are achievable based upon the Companys fiscal 2010 operating plan. Management has also identified other actions within their control that could be implemented, as
necessary, to help the Company meet these quarterly requirements. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful. Additionally, in light of market conditions, it is possible that the Company may be unable to comply with the new financial covenants during fiscal 2010. Textron could also declare a loan violation due to a material adverse change, as
defined in the agreement. As a result, if a loan violation were to occur and not be remedied in accordance with the terms of the floor plan facility, Textron could declare an event of default and demand that the full amount of the facility be paid
in full prior to maturity. Such a demand would result in, among other things, a cross default of the Companys convertible senior notes described in Note 6. While the Company is currently exploring asset sales and other types of capital raising alternatives in order to generate liquidity, there can be no assurance that such activities will be successful or generate cash
resources adequate to fully retire the Textron floor plan facility at maturity. In this event, there can be no assurance that Textron will consent to a further amendment of the floor plan facility agreement.

Senior Notes due 2024 the Notes in a private, unregistered offering. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in May and November. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of the Companys
existing and future unsecured and senior indebtedness. The note holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on May 15, 2011,May15, 2014 and May15, 2019 at a repurchase price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Each $1,000 in principal amount of the Notes is convertible, at the option of the holder, at a conversion price of $2592, or 385803 shares of the
Companys common stock upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and contingencies. For fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, the effect of converting the senior notes to 21million, 29million and 29million shares of common
stock, respectively, was anti-dilutive, and was, therefore, not considered in determining diluted earnings per share. At March27, 2009 and March28, 2008, the fair market value of the convertible senior notes is estimated at $215 and
$424 million, respectively, based on quoted market prices. During fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased $212 million of the Notes for $106 million in cash, resulting in a gain of $106 million. On July12, 2005, the Company, through its subsidiary CountryPlace, completed its initial securitization 2005-1 for approximately $1410 million
of loans, which was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately $1184 million. The bonds were issued in four different classes: ClassA-1 totaling $363 million with a coupon rate of 423%; ClassA-2 totaling $274 million with a
coupon rate of 442%; ClassA-3 totaling $273 million with a coupon rate of 480%; and ClassA-4 totaling $274 million with a coupon rate of 520%. Maturity of the bonds is at varying dates beginning in 2006 through 2015 and were issued
with an expected weighted average maturity of 466 years. The proceeds from the securitization were used to repay approximately $1157 million of borrowings on the Companys warehouse revolving debt with the remaining proceeds being used for
general corporate purposes, including future origination of new loans. For accounting purposes, this transaction was structured as a securitized borrowing. CountryPlaces obligation under this securitized financing is guaranteed by the Company.
On March22, 2007, the Company, through its subsidiary CountryPlace, completed its second securitization 2007-1 for approximately
$1165 million of loans, which was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately $1019 million. The bonds were issued in four classes: ClassA-1 totaling $289 million with a coupon rate of 5484%; ClassA-2 totaling $234 million with a
coupon rate of 5232%; ClassA-3 totaling $245 million with a coupon rate of 5593%; and ClassA-4 totaling $251 million with a coupon rate of 5846%. Maturity of the bonds is at varying dates beginning in 2008 through 2017 and were
issued with an expected weighted average maturity of 486 years. The proceeds from the securitization were used to repay approximately $971 million of borrowings on the Companys warehouse revolving debt with the remaining proceeds being used
for general corporate purposes, including future origination of new loans. For accounting purposes, this transaction was also structured as a securitized borrowing. 
56 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
Upon completion of the 2007-1 securitization, CountryPlace extinguished its interest rate swap
agreement on its variable rate debt which was used to hedge against an increase in variable interest rates. Upon extinguishment of the hedge, CountryPlace recorded a loss of $10 million, net of tax, for the change in fair value to other
comprehensive income loss, which is amortized to interest expense over the life of the loans. The Company, through its subsidiary,
CountryPlace, had an agreement with a financial institution for a $1500 million warehouse borrowing facility to fund loans originated by CountryPlace. On April25, 2008, CountryPlace sold approximately $513 million of its warehoused portfolio
of chattel and mortgage loans. Approximately $415 million of the proceeds were used to repay in full and terminate the warehouse borrowing facility scheduled to expire on April30, 2008. In January 2009, CountryPlace obtained a $100 million
construction lending line to use for financing mortgage loans during the construction period. There is no expiration period for the agreement, but CountryPlace is obligated to repurchase individual loans within 180 days from the date of original
purchase of each respective loan by the financial institution. Historically, the construction period has been approximately ninety days. The construction lender has full discretion to accept or decline each individual loan purchase requested by
CountryPlace. The maximum advance for loans purchased is 92% of the loan amount. The interest rate on unpaid amounts advanced is 10%. CountryPlace had outstanding unpaid advances under the facility of $36 million as of March31, 2009. The
facility contains certain requirements relating to the documentation of the loans purchased and amounts drawn during the construction period of each individual loan, which are customary in the industry. CountryPlace funds the difference between the
amounts advanced under the facility and the balance of any additional loan. On April27, 2009, the Company issued warrants to each of
Capital Southwest Venture Corporation, Sally Posey and the Estate of Lee Posey collectively, the lenders to purchase up to an aggregate of 429,939 shares of common stock of the Company at a price of $314 per share, which was the closing price of
the Companys common stock on April24, 2009. The warrants were granted in connection with a loan made by the lenders to the Company of an aggregate of $45 million pursuant to senior subordinated secured promissory notes between the
Company and each of the lenders collectively, the Promissory Notes. The proceeds were used for working capital purposes. If the Promissory Notes are not repaid in full by June29, 2009, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may
be purchased may be increased by an amount equal to $450,000 divided by the closing price of the common stock on June29, 2009. The warrants, which expire on April24, 2019, contain anti-dilution provisions and other customary provisions.
The Promissory Notes bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 20% and are secured by 150,000 shares of Standards common stock. The Promissory Notes also restrict the Company from selling, leasing or otherwise transferring all or any material
portion of its assets or businesses without the lenders consent. Scheduled maturities of the Companys debt obligations

Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. To the extent the
Company believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized prior to expiration, it is required to establish a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax assets. The
determination of valuation allowances involves significant management judgments and is based upon the evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, including the Companys best estimates of anticipated taxable profits in the various
jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated. Changes in events or expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to the Companys provision for income taxes. 
The Company reviewed its deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance was necessary. In fiscal 2008, the Company recognized a
valuation allowance of $319 million against all of its net deferred tax assets which resulted in the Company recording an income tax provision of approximately $139 million. In fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an additional $149 million
valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in fiscal 2009 and an income tax benefit of $8,000. If, after future considerations of positive and negative evidence related to the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, the Company
determines a lesser allowance is required, it would record a reduction to income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination. Income tax benefit expense for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 is as follows in thousands:  March27,2009 March28,2008 March30,2007

The fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. As of March29, 2008, the Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No157 Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 defines fair
value, introduces a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities. The Company elected to implement SFAS 157 with the one-year deferral permitted by FASB Staff Position No157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No157 FSP 157-2, issued February 2008, which defers the effective
date of SFAS 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. As it relates to the
Company, the deferral applies to assets held for sale, which totaled $58 million as of March27, 2009. SFAS 157 defines fair values
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. SFAS 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs
that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not
active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company had no level 3 securities at the end of 2009 or
during the year then ended. The Company utilizes the market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and liabilities. The
market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below in thousands:  As of March27, 2009 Total

Controls and Procedures Managements
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15e
and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys
management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of March27, 2009. Based on that evaluation, the Companys
management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March27, 2009. During the quarter ending on March27, 2009, there was no change in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March27, 2009 using the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of March27, 2009, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March27, 2009, has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, the independent
registered accounting firm who also audited the Companys consolidated statements. Ernst Young LLPs attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting appears on page 67. s/LARRY H. KEENER
