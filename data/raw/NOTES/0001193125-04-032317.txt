Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar Corporation:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lennar
Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of November 30, 2003 and 2002 and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2003.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 30, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended November 30, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  /s/DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Certified Public Accountants  Miami, Florida February 27, 2004

35  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lennar Corporation and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities the
Company in which the Company has a controlling interest and variable interest entities VIEs created after January 31, 2003 in which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary see Note 15. The Companys
investments in unconsolidated partnerships in which a significant, but less than controlling, interest is held and VIEs created after January 31, 2003 in which the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, are accounted for by the equity
method. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  Stock Split  In December 2003, the Companys Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend of Class A and Class B
common stock for stockholders of record on January 6, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on January 20, 2004. All share and per share amounts except authorized shares, treasury shares and par value have been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split. There was no net effect on total stockholders equity as a result of the stock split.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Revenue Recognition  Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. Revenues from sales of other real estate
including the sales of land and operating properties are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete and the collection of any remaining receivables is reasonably assured.  Cash  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Due to the short maturity period of the cash equivalents, the carrying amount of these instruments approximates their fair values. Cash as of November 30, 2003 and 2002 included $687 million and $562 million, respectively, of cash
primarily held in escrow for approximately three days and $452 million and $209 million, respectively, of restricted deposits.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down
to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes and interest related to development and construction. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment based on the undiscounted
future cash flows of the assets. Write-downs of inventories deemed to be impaired are recorded as adjustments to the cost basis of the respective inventories. No impairment was recorded during the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 or 2001.
Construction overhead and selling expenses are expensed as
incurred. Homes held for sale are classified as inventories until delivered. Land, land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas. 
36  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Interest and Real Estate Taxes  Interest and real estate taxes attributable to land and homes are capitalized as inventories while they are being actively
developed. Interest related to homebuilding and land, including interest costs relieved from inventories, is included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold. Interest expense related to the financial services operations is included in its costs
and expenses.  During 2003, 2002 and 2001, interest incurred by
the Companys homebuilding operations was $1318million, $1306 million and $1279 million, respectively, and interest expense primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold was $1413 million, $1456 million and $1195
million, respectively.  Operating Properties and Equipment
Operating properties and equipment are recorded at cost
and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. At the time operating properties and equipment are disposed of, the asset and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to earnings. The estimated useful life for operating properties is 30 years, for leasehold improvements is 5 years and for equipment is 2 to
10 years.  Investment Securities  Investment securities are classified as available-for-sale unless they are
classified as trading or held-to-maturity. Securities classified as trading are carried at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded in earnings. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost because
they are purchased with the intent and ability to hold to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Any unrealized holding gains or losses on available-for-sale securities would be reported in a separate component of
stockholders equity, net of tax effects, until realized.  At November 30, 2003 and 2002, investment securities classified as held-to-maturity totaled $280 million and $224 million, respectively, and were included in the assets of the Financial Services Division. At November 30, 2003, investment
securities classified as trading totaled $69 million and were included in other assets of the Homebuilding Division. The trading securities are comprised mainly of marketable equity mutual funds designated to approximate the Companys
liabilities under its deferred compensation plan. There were no available-for-sale investment securities at November 30, 2003 or 2002.  Derivative Financial Instruments  Effective December 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured
at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income and recognized in the statement of earnings when the hedged item affects earnings, depending
on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  The Companys policy is to designate at a derivatives inception the specific assets, liabilities, or future commitments being hedged and monitor the derivative to determine if it remains an effective hedge.
The effectiveness of a derivative as a hedge is based on high correlation between changes in its value and changes in the value of the underlying hedged item. The Company recognizes gains or losses for amounts received or paid when the underlying
transaction settles. The Company does not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  The Company has various interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on approximately $300
million of outstanding debt related to its homebuilding operations. The swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and, accordingly, are reflected at their fair value in 
37  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
the consolidated balance sheets at November 30, 2003 and 2002. The related loss is deferred, net of tax, in stockholders equity as accumulated other
comprehensive loss see Note 11. The Company accounts for its interest rate swaps using the shortcut method, as described in SFAS No. 133. Amounts to be received or paid as a result of the swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest
incurred on the related debt instruments. The Company believes that there will be no ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swaps and therefore no portion of the accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into future earnings.
The net effect on the Companys operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates.  The Financial Services Division, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates. The Division enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of fixed rate locked loan commitments and loans held for sale from fluctuations in market interest rates. These derivative
financial instruments are designated as fair value hedges, and, accordingly, for all qualifying and highly effective fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the loss or gain on the hedged asset relating to the risk
being hedged are recorded currently in earnings. The effect of the implementation of SFAS No. 133 on the Financial Services Divisions operating earnings was not significant.  Goodwill  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and was amortized by the Company through fiscal 2001 on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 15 to 20 years. At November 30, 2003 and 2002, goodwill was $2127 million and $1894 million, respectively net of accumulated amortization of $180 million at November 30, 2003 and 2002. During fiscal
2003, the Companys goodwill increased $303 million due to current year acquisitions and payment of contingent consideration related to prior year acquisitions, partially offset by the reduction of the Companys net deferred tax asset
valuation allowance. Because the asset was established in connection with an acquisition, the reduction of the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease to goodwill. Goodwill is included in other assets of the Homebuilding Division $1692 million
and $1554 million at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively and the assets of the Financial Services Division $435 million and $340 million at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively in the consolidated balance sheets. Historically through
fiscal 2001, in the event that facts and circumstances had indicated that the carrying value of goodwill might be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would have been performed. If an evaluation had been required, the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows associated with the goodwill would have been compared to the carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value based on discounted cash flows was required. No impairment was recorded during the years ended November
30, 2003, 2002 or 2001.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on December 1, 2001. SFAS No. 142 no longer requires or permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Instead, these assets must be reviewed annually or more frequently
under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with this statement. This impairment test uses a fair value approach rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required by SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. No impairment charges were recognized from the adoption of SFAS No. 142. The Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2003 and determined that
goodwill was not impaired. As of November 30, 2003 and 2002, there were no material identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill. Net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal 2001 adjusted for the Companys April 2003 10% Class B
stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization, net of taxes, is as follows:

Goodwill amortization, net of tax 004 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 277  Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting carrying values and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured by using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse.  Warranty Costs  Warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard
to warranty-type claims to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based on historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. Warranty reserves are included in accounts payable
and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table sets forth the activity in the Companys warranty reserve for the year ended November 30, 2003:  Inthousands Warranty reserve, November 30, 2002 93,606 Provision 120,167 Payments 97,202 Warranty reserve, November 30, 2003 116,571  Self-Insurance
Certain insurable risks such as general liability,
medical and workers compensation are self-insured by the Company up to certain limits. Undiscounted accruals for claims under the Companys self-insurance program are based on claims filed and estimates for claims incurred but not
reported.  Advertising Costs  The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were
$549 million, $439 million and $436 million for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company grants stock options to certain employees for fixed numbers of shares with, in each instance, an exercise price not less than the fair value
of the shares at the date of the grant. The Company accounts for the 
39  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
stock option grants in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. No
compensation expense is recognized because all stock options granted have exercise prices not less than the market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant. The Company also grants restricted stock, which is valued based on the
market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Unearned compensation arising from the restricted stock grants is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the period of the restrictions. Unearned restricted stock is shown as a
reduction of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets.  The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation as

Earnings per Share
Earnings per share is accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which requires a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings attributable to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company.  Financial Services  Loan origination revenues, net of direct origination costs, are recognized when the related loans are sold. Gains and losses from the sale of loans and
loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and 
40  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
delivered to an investor. Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the policy. Escrow fees are recognized at
the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow.  Mortgage loans held for sale by the Financial Services Division that are designated as hedged assets are carried at market value, as the effect of changes in fair value are reflected in the carrying amount of the
loans and in earnings. Premiums and discounts recorded on these loans are presented as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the loans and are not amortized. 
When the Division sells loans in the secondary market, a gain or loss is recognized to the extent that the sales proceeds exceed, or are less than, the
book value of the loans. Loan origination fees, net of direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as a component of the gain or loss when loans are sold.  Mortgage loans for which the Financial Services Division has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity consist of
mortgage loans carried at cost, net of unamortized discounts. Discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans using the interest method.  The Division also provides allowances for loan losses when and if management determines that loans or portions thereof are uncollectible. The provision
recorded and the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by managements continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of past loan loss experience, regulatory examinations, present economic conditions and other factors
considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic factors which may influence the level of the allowance are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. While
management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary as a result of future economic and other conditions that may be beyond managements control.  The Division provides an allowance for estimated title and escrow losses
based upon managements evaluation of claims presented and estimates for any incurred but not reported claims. The allowance is established at a level that management estimates to be sufficient to satisfy those claims where a loss is determined
to be probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The allowance for title and escrow losses for both known and incurred but not reported claims is considered by management to be adequate for such purposes.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 provides accounting guidance for financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes
SFAS No121. The implementation of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging
activities under SFAS No. 133. This statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The implementation of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.  In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. Certain provisions of this statement were effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2003. In October 2003, the FASB deferred indefinitely certain provisions of this statement pertaining to non-controlling interests 
41  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
in limited life entities. The Company does not believe that the implementation of SFAS No. 150 had, or will have, a material impact on the Companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In
November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. In accordance with the provisions of
FIN 45, the Company adopted the initial recognition and measurement provisions on a prospective basis with regard to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002. The implementation of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the Companys
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as further clarified and amended by the FASBs issuance of a revision to FIN 46 in December 2003. FIN46 requires
the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial
interests in the entity. Prior to the issuance of FIN 46, entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise when it had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. FIN 46 applied immediately to
variable interests created after January 31, 2003, and with respect to variable interests created before February 1, 2003, FIN 46 will apply in the Companys second quarter ending May 31, 2004, as deferred by the FASB in December 2003. Although
the Company does not believe the full adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on net earnings, the Company cannot make any definitive determination until it completes its evaluation see Note 15.  In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC
expressed their view on accounting for loan commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for resale. It is the SECs view that loan commitments are written options that should be recorded at their fair value,
which in all cases should be a liability until either expiration or exercise. The Company estimates the value of these loan commitments as the difference between the current value of similar loans and the price at which the Company has committed to
originate the loans. Under the Companys current method of accounting for these loan commitments, the Company recognizes both derivative assets and liabilities. The SECs view, which is to be applied prospectively, is effective for
commitments entered into in the first reporting period beginning after March 15, 2004. Management is currently evaluating the adoption of the SECs view and has not made a definitive determination as to its impact.  Reclassifications  Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on reported net earnings. In particular, homebuilding results reflect reclassifications that have been made to interest expense now included in cost of
homes sold and cost of land sold, equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships and management fees and other income, net.  2.Acquisitions  During 2003, the Company expanded its presence in California and South Carolina through its homebuilding acquisitions, and purchased a title company,
which expanded the Companys title and closing business into the Chicago market. In connection with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to prior period acquisitions, the Company paid $1594 million, net of cash acquired. The
results of operations of the companies acquired by the Company are included in the Companys results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the results of operations is not
presented as the effect is not considered material. Total goodwill associated with these acquisitions and contingent consideration relating to prior year acquisitions was $303 million.  During 2002, the Company expanded its operations into the Carolinas and the Chicago, Baltimore and Central Valley,
California homebuilding markets and strengthened its positions in several of its existing markets 
42  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
with the Companys homebuilding acquisitions. In connection with these acquisitions, total consideration, including debt of acquired companies, totaled
approximately $600 million. The results of operations of the homebuilders acquired by the Company are included in the Companys results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the
results of operations is not presented as the effect is not considered material. Total goodwill associated with these acquisitions was $747million.  3.Operating and Reporting Segments  The Company has two operating and reporting segments: Homebuilding and Financial Services. The Companys reportable segments are strategic business
units that offer different products and services. The accounting policies of the segments are described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Segment amounts include all elimination adjustments made in consolidation.
Homebuilding  Homebuilding operations primarily include the sale and construction of
single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Companys unconsolidated partnerships.  Financial Services  The Financial Services Division provides mortgage financing, title insurance, closing services and insurance agency services for both buyers of the
Companys homes and others. It sells the loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market. The Financial Services Division also provides high-speed Internet access, cable television and alarm installation and monitoring services to
residents of the Companys communities and others.  Financial information relating to the Companys reportable segments is as follows:  Years Ended November 30 2003

27,051  At November 30, 2003,
the Companys equity interest in these Partnerships did not exceed 50%. The Companys partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land sellers or other real estate entities. The Partnerships follow accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. The Company shares in the profits and losses of these Partnerships generally in accordance with its ownership interests. In many instances, the Company is appointed as the day-to-day manager of the
Partnerships and receives fees for performing this function. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company received management fees and reimbursement of expenses from the Partnerships totaling $390 million, $292 million and $261 million, respectively.
In determining its share of the Partnerships net earnings, the Company does not include in its income its pro rata share of partnership earnings resulting from land sales to its homebuilding divisions. Instead, the Company accounts for those
earnings as a reduction of the cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships. This in effect defers recognition of the Companys share of the partnership earnings relating to these sales until a home is delivered and title passes to a
homebuyer.  The Company and/or its partners sometimes obtain
options or enter into other arrangements under which the Company can purchase portions of the land held by the Partnerships. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when the options are purchased. During 2003, 2002
and 2001, $4605 million, $4193 million and $2326 million, respectively, of the Partnerships revenues were from land sales to the Company.  In some instances, the Company and/or its partners have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt of unconsolidated partnerships. At November 30,
2003, the Company had recourse guarantees of $887 million and limited maintenance guarantees of $1116 million of debt of unconsolidated partnerships. When the Company and/or its partners provide a guarantee, the partnership generally receives more
favorable terms from its lenders than would otherwise be available to it. The limited maintenance guarantees only apply if a partnership defaults on its loan arrangements and the carrying value of the collateral generally land and improvements is
less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If the Company is required to make a payment under a limited maintenance guarantee to bring the carrying value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment
would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated partnership and increase the Companys share of any funds the unconsolidated partnership distributes. There were no assets held as collateral that, upon the occurrence of any
triggering event or condition under a guarantee, the Company could obtain and liquidate to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under a guarantee.  In November 2003, the Company and LNR each contributed its 50% interests in certain of its jointly-owned unconsolidated partnerships that had significant
assets to a new limited liability company named LandSource Communities Development LLC LandSource, in exchange for 50% interests in LandSource. In addition, in July 2003, the Company and LNR formed, and obtained 50% interests in, NWHL
Investment, LLC NWHL, which agreed to purchase, and in January 2004 completed the purchase, of The Newhall Land and Farming Company Newhall for a total of approximately $1 billion. Newhalls primary business is
developing two master-planned communities in Los Angeles County, California. The Company and LNR each contributed approximately $200 million to NWHL, and LandSource and NWHL jointly obtained $600 million of bank financing, of which $400 million was
used in connection with the acquisition of Newhall the remainder of the acquisition price was paid with proceeds of a sale of income-producing properties from Newhall to LNR for $217million at the closing of the transaction. The Company
agreed to purchase 687 homesites and obtained options to purchase 623 homesites from the venture. The Company is not obligated with regard to the borrowings by LandSource and NWHL, except that the Company and LNR have made limited maintenance
guarantees and 
45  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
have committed to complete any property development commitments in the event of default. The combined assets and liabilities of LandSource and NWHL at
November 30, 2003 were $3807 million and $1223million, respectively. The Companys combined investment in LandSource and NWHL was $1288 million at November 30, 2003.  6.Operating Properties and Equipment  November 30 2003 2002 In thousands Furniture, fixtures and equipment 38,354 43,492 Community recreational facilities 6,083 8,077 Leasehold improvements 13,032 7,510 57,469 59,079 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 36,631 41,919 20,838 17,160  Operating properties

Company amended and restated its senior secured credit facilities the Credit Facilities to provide the Company with up to $13 billion of financing. The Credit Facilities consist of a $712 million revolving credit facility maturing in
May 2008, a $315 million 364-day revolving credit facility maturing in May 2004 and a $300 million term loan B maturing in December 2008. The Company may elect to convert borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility to a term loan, which
would mature in May 2008. The Credit Facilities are collateralized by the stock of certain of the Companys subsidiaries and are also guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of the Companys subsidiaries, other than
subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities. At November 30, 2003, $2960 million was outstanding under the term loan B and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facilities. Interest rates are
LIBOR-based and the margins are set by a pricing grid with thresholds that adjust based on changes in the Companys leverage ratio and the Credit Facilities credit rating.  At November 30, 2003, the Company had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $6279 million. The majority of these
letters of credit are posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee the Companys performance of certain development and construction activities or are posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. Of the Companys total letters of
credit, $3414 million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the Credit Facilities. 
46  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
In February 2003, the Company issued $350 million of 595% senior notes due 2013 at a price of
98287%. Proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discount and expenses, were approximately $342 million. The Company used $116 million of the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness and added the remainder to its general working capital.
The senior notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of the Companys subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities. At November 30, 2003, the carrying value of
the senior notes was $3443 million.  In June 2003, the Company
called its 37/8% zero-coupon senior convertible debentures due 2018 the Debentures for redemption.
At the option of the holders, the Debentures could have been converted into Class A common stock at any time prior to the redemption date. Each $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Debentures was convertible into 274814 shares of Class A common
stock inclusive of the adjustment for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split, which equated to a redemption price of approximately $2046 per share of Class A common stock. In 2003, substantially all
of the Debentures were converted into approximately 136 million shares of Class A common stock adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split. 
As a result of the acquisition of The Fortress Group, Inc. Fortress in 2002, the Company assumed Fortresss publicly held notes
totaling $338 million. During fiscal 2003, the Company repaid the balance of the outstanding senior notes.  In the second quarter of 2001, the Company issued, for gross proceeds of approximately $230 million, zero-coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due
2021 Notes with a face amount at maturity of approximately $633 million. The Notes were issued at a price of $36346 per $1,000 face amount at maturity, which equates to a yield to maturity over the life of the Notes of 5125%.
Proceeds from the issuance, after underwriting discount, were approximately $224 million. The Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of the Companys subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries engaged in mortgage and
title reinsurance activities. The Company used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and added the balance of the net proceeds to working capital. The indenture relating to the Notes provides that the Notes
are convertible into the Companys Class A common stock during limited periods after the market price of the Companys Class A common stock exceeds 110% of the accreted conversion price at the rate of approximately 142 Class A common
shares per $1,000 face amount of Notes at maturity, which would total approximately 90 million shares adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split. For this purpose, the market
price is the average closing price of the Companys Class A common stock over the last twenty trading days of a fiscal quarter.  Other events that would cause the Notes to be convertible are: a a call of the Notes for redemption; b the initial credit ratings assigned to the Notes
by any two of Moodys Investors Service, Inc., Standard Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings are reduced by two rating levels; c a distribution to all holders of the Companys Class A common stock of options expiring
within 60 days entitling the holders to purchase common stock for less than its quoted price; or d a distribution to all holders of the Companys Class A common stock of common stock, assets, debt, securities or rights to purchase securities
with a per share value exceeding 15% of the closing price of the Class A common stock on the day preceding the declaration date for the distribution. The conversion ratio equates to an initial conversion price of $2564 per share when the
Companys stock price was $1942 per share adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split.  At November 30, 2003, the Notes were convertible because the average closing price of the Companys Class A common stock over the last twenty trading
days of the fourth quarter of 2003 adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split exceeded 110% $3228 per share at November 30, 2003 of the accreted conversion price. These shares were not
included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended November 30, 2002 and 2001 because the contingencies discussed above were not met. 
Holders have the option to require the Company to repurchase the Notes on any of the fifth, tenth, or fifteenth anniversaries of the issue date for the
initial issue price plus accrued yield to the purchase date. The 
47  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Company has the option to satisfy the repurchases with any combination of cash and/or shares of the Companys common stock. The Company will have the
option to redeem the Notes, in cash, at any time after the fifth anniversary for the initial issue price plus accrued yield to redemption. The Company will pay contingent interest on the Notes during specified six-month periods beginning on April 4,
2006 if the market price of the Notes exceeds specified levels. At November 30, 2003, the carrying value of outstanding Notes, net of unamortized original issue discount, was $2610 million.  At November 30, 2003, the Company had mortgage notes on land and other debt
bearing interest at fixed interest rates ranging from 29% to 250% with an average rate of 88%. The notes are due through 2009 and are collateralized by land. At November 30, 2003, the carrying value of the mortgage notes on land and other debt
was $730 million.  The minimum aggregate principal maturities
of senior notes and other debts payable during the five years subsequent to November30, 2003 are as follows: 2004$215 million; 2005$457 million; 2006$184 million; 2007$40 million and 2008$40 million. The
remaining principal obligations are due subsequent to November30, 2008. The Companys debt arrangements contain certain financial covenants with which the Company was in compliance at November 30, 2003.  8.Financial Services  The assets and liabilities related to the Companys financial services

There are several interest rate pricing options which fluctuate with market rates. The effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2003 and 2002 was 17% and 23%, respectively. The warehouse lines of credit mature in May 2004
$250million and in October 2005 $500 million, at which time the Division expects both facilities to be renewed. Additionally, the line of credit maturing in May 2004 includes an incremental $100 million commitment available at each fiscal
quarter-end. At November 30, 2003 and 2002, the Division had advances under a conduit funding agreement with a major financial institution amounting to $06 million and $3437million, respectively. Borrowings under this agreement are
collateralized by mortgage loans and had an 
48  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
effective interest rate of 19% and 23% at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Division also had a $20 million revolving line of credit with a
bank, collateralized by certain assets of the Division and stock of certain title subsidiaries. Borrowings under the line of credit were $194 million and $200 million at November30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and had an effective interest
rate of 21% and 24% at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The limited-purpose finance subsidiaries of the Financial Services Division have placed mortgages and other receivables as collateral for various long-term financings. These limited-purpose finance subsidiaries pay the principal of, and
interest on, these financings almost entirely from the cash flows generated by the related pledged collateral, which includes a combination of mortgage notes, mortgage-backed securities and funds held by a trustee. At November 30, 2003 and 2002, the
balances outstanding for the bonds and notes payable were $58 million and $92 million, respectively. The borrowings mature in 2015 through 2018 and carry interest rates ranging from 88% to 117%. The annual principal repayments are dependent upon
collections on the underlying mortgages, including prepayments, and therefore cannot be reasonably determined.  The minimum aggregate principal maturities of the Financial Services Divisions notes and other debts payable including limited-purpose finance
subsidiaries during the five years subsequent to November 30, 2003 are as follows: 2004$7345 million; 2005$01 million and 2006$01 million. The remaining principal obligations are due subsequent to November 30, 2008.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The tax effects of significant temporary differences that give rise to the net deferred tax asset are as follows:  November 30 2003

Divisions net deferred tax asset amounting to $1667 million and $1144 million at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.  At November 30, 2003 and 2002, the Financial Services Division had a net
deferred tax asset of $111million and $78 million, respectively, which is included in the assets of the Financial Services Division.  SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than
not that a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Based on managements assessment, it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings. During fiscal 2003,
restrictions associated with the utilization of the capital loss carryforwards and acquisition adjustments lapsed, resulting in the reduction of the valuation allowance. Because the asset was established in connection with an acquisition, the
reduction of the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease to goodwill.  A reconciliation of the statutory rate and the effective tax rate follows:  PercentageofPre-taxIncome 2003 2002

earnings per share amounts and weighted average shares outstanding have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and the January 2004 two-for-one stock split.  In 2001, the Company issued zero-coupon convertible senior subordinated notes
due 2021. The indenture relating to the notes provides that the notes are convertible into the Companys Class A common stock during limited periods after the market price of the Companys Class A common stock exceeds 110% of the accreted
conversion price at the rate of approximately 142 Class A common shares per $1,000 face amount of notes at maturity, which would total approximately 90 million shares adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004
two-for-one stock split. For this purpose, the market price is the average closing price of the Companys Class A common stock over the last twenty trading days of a fiscal quarter.  Other events that would cause the notes to be convertible are: a a call of
the notes for redemption; b the initial credit ratings assigned to the notes by any two of Moodys Investors Service, Inc., Standard Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings are reduced by two rating levels; c a distribution to
all holders of the Companys Class A common stock of options expiring within 60 days entitling the holders to purchase common stock for less than its quoted price; or d a distribution to all holders of the Companys Class A common stock
of common stock, assets, debt, securities or rights to purchase securities with a per share value exceeding 15% of the closing price of the Class A common stock on the day preceding the declaration date for the distribution.  The calculation of diluted earnings per share included 45 million shares
adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split for the year ended November 30, 2003 because the average closing price of the Companys Class A common stock over the last twenty trading days
of both the third and fourth quarters of 2003 exceeded 110% of the accreted conversion price. These shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended November 30, 2002 and 2001 because the contingencies
discussed above were not met.

11.Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive income represents changes in stockholders equity from non-owner sources. For the years ended November
30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps was the only adjustment to the Companys net earnings in deriving comprehensive income. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS No. 133, on December 1,
2000, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect type adjustment of $35 million net of tax benefit of $22 million in accounts payable and other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss to recognize the fair value of interest rate
swaps. Subsequent to the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 133 through November 30, 2001, the liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss increased $158 million net of tax benefit of $99 million to $193 million. For the years ended
November 30, 2003 and 2002, the liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $35 million net of tax of $21 million and increased $52 million net of tax benefit of $27 million, respectively. Comprehensive income was
$7549million, $5400 million and $3986 million for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  12.Capital Stock  Preferred Stock  The Company is authorized to issue 500,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $10 per share and 100 million shares of participating preferred
stock with a par value of $010 per share. No shares of preferred stock or participating preferred stock have been issued as of November 30, 2003.  Common Stock  On April 8, 2003, at the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the Companys
certificate of incorporation that eliminated the restrictions on transfer of the Companys Class B common stock and eliminated a difference between the dividends on the common stock renamed Class A common stock and the Class B common stock.
The only significant remaining difference between the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock is that the Class A common stock entitles holders to one vote per share and the Class B common stock entitles holders to ten votes per share.
Because stockholders approved the change to the terms of the
Class B common stock, the Company distributed to the holders of record of its stock at the close of business on April 9, 2003, one share of Class B common stock for each ten shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock held at that time.
The distribution occurred on April 21, 2003 and the Companys Class B common stock became listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE. The Companys Class A common stock was already listed on the NYSE. Approximately 13 million
shares of Class B common stock adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split were issued as a result of the stock distribution.  Additionally, the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of common stock
the Company is authorized to issue to 300 million shares of Class A common stock and 90 million shares of Class B common stock. However, the Company has committed to Institutional Shareholder Services that it will not issue, without a subsequent
stockholder vote, shares that would increase the outstanding Class A common stock to more than 170 million shares or increase the outstanding Class B common stock to more than 45 million shares.  In September 2003, the Companys Board of Directors voted to increase
the rate at which dividends are paid with regard to the Companys Class A and Class B common stock to $050 per share per year payable quarterly from $0025 per share per year adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split. During
2003, Class A and Class B common stockholders received annual dividends of $014 per share. During 2002 and 2001, Class A common stockholders received quarterly dividends of $000625 per share and the Class B common stockholders received quarterly
dividends of $0005625 per share. 
52  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
As of November 30, 2003, Mr. Stuart Miller, the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer,
directly owned or controlled as the director and officer of family-owned entities, approximately 22 million shares adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split of Class A and Class B common stock, which represented approximately 48%
voting power of the Companys stock.  In December 2003,
the Companys Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend of Class A and Class B common stock for stockholders of record on January 6, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on January 20,
2004. All share and per share amounts except authorized shares, treasury shares and par value have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the split. There was no net effect on total stockholders equity as a result of the stock split.
In June 2001, the Companys Board of Directors increased
the previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to 20 million shares adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split of the Companys outstanding Class A common stock. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the
Company did not repurchase any of its outstanding Class A or Class B common stock in the open market under these authorizations. In prior years under prior approvals, the Company had repurchased approximately 98million shares not adjusted
for the Companys January 2004 two-for-one stock split of its outstanding Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1589 million, or $16 per share. In September 2003, the Board of Directors voted to retire the
Companys Class A common stock held in treasury. As a result, approximately 99 million Class A common shares not adjusted for the Companys January 2004 two-for-one stock split were retired. The retirement had no net effect on total
stockholders equity. In December 2003, the Company granted approximately 24 million stock options adjusted for the Companys January 2004 two-for-one stock split to employees under the 2003 Plan and in January 2004, repurchased a
similar amount of shares of its outstanding Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1096 million, or $4564 per share adjusted for the Companys January 2004 two-for-one stock split.  At November 30, 2003, the Company had shelf registration statements under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to up to $620 million of equity or debt securities which it may sell for cash and up to $400million of equity or debt securities which it could issue in connection with acquisitions of companies,
businesses or assets.  Restrictions on Payment of Dividends
Other than as required to maintain the financial ratios
and net worth required by the Credit Facilities, there are no restrictions on the payment of dividends on common stock by the Company. There are no agreements which restrict the payment of dividends by subsidiaries of the Company other than as
required to maintain the financial ratios and net worth requirements under the Financial Services Divisions warehouse lines of credit.  Stock Option Plans  The Lennar Corporation 2003 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan the 2003 Plan provides for the granting of Class A and Class B stock
options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers, employees and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights are not less than the market value of the common stock on the
date of the grant. No options granted under the 2003 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock
appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the date of the grant. At November 30, 2003, there were no shares of restricted stock outstanding under the 2003 Plan.  The Lennar Corporation 2000 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan the
2000 Plan provided for the granting of Class A stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers, employees and directors. No options granted under the 2000 Plan may be exercisable until
at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options 
53  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the
date of the grant. At November 30, 2003, a combined total of 1,036,200 shares of Class A and Class B restricted stock adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split were outstanding under the Plan. The stock was valued based on its market
price on the date of the grant. The grants vest over 5 years from the date of issuance. Unearned compensation arising from the restricted stock grants is amortized to expense over the period of the restrictions and is shown as a reduction of
stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets.  The Lennar Corporation 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan provided for the granting of Class A stock options and stock appreciation rights to key employees of the Company to purchase shares at prices not less than market
value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the 1997 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are
granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right granted will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the date of the grant.  The Lennar Corporation 1991 Stock Option Plan the 1991 Plan provided for the granting of options to certain
key employees of the Company to purchase Class A shares at prices not less than market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the 1991 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the
grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option granted will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the date of the grant.

Employee Stock
Ownership/401k Plan  Prior to 1998, the Employee Stock
Ownership/401k Plan the Plan provided shares of stock to employees who had completed one year of continuous service with the Company. During 1998, the Plan was amended to exclude any new shares from being provided to employees. All
prior year contributions to employees actively employed on or after October 1, 1998 vested at a rate of 20% per year over a five year period. All active participants in the Plan whose employment terminated prior to October 1, 1998 vested based upon
the Plan that was active prior to their termination of employment. Under the 401k portion of the Plan, contributions made by employees can be invested in a variety of mutual funds or proprietary funds provided by the Plan trustee. The Company may
also make contributions for the benefit of employees. The Company records as compensation expense an amount which approximates the vesting of the contributions to the Employee Stock Ownership portion of the Plan, as well as the Companys
contribution to the 401k portion of the Plan. This amount was $91 million in 2003, $70 million in 2002 and $65 million in 2001.  13.Deferred Compensation Plan  In June 2002, the Company adopted the Lennar Corporation Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan the Deferred Compensation Plan that allows
a selected group of members of management to defer a portion of their salaries and bonuses and up to 100% of their restricted stock. All participant contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan are vested. Salaries and bonuses that are deferred
under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited with earnings or losses based on investment decisions made by the participants. The cash contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan are invested by the Company in various investment securities
that are classified as trading.  Restricted stock is deferred
under the Deferred Compensation Plan by surrendering the restricted stock in exchange for the right to receive in the future a number of shares equal to the number of restricted shares that are surrendered. The surrender is reflected as a reduction
in stockholders equity equal to the value of the restricted stock when it was issued, with an offsetting increase in stockholders equity to reflect a deferral of the compensation expense related to the surrendered restricted stock.
Changes in the value of the shares that will be issued in the future are not reflected in the financial statements.  As of November 30, 2003, approximately 534,000 Class A shares and 53,400 Class B shares of restricted stock adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock
distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split had been surrendered in exchange for rights under the Deferred Compensation Plan, resulting in a reduction in stockholders equity of $49 million fully offset by an increase in
stockholders equity to reflect the deferral of compensation in that amount. Shares that the Company is obligated to issue in the future under the Deferred Compensation Plan are treated as outstanding shares in both the Companys basic and
diluted earnings per share calculations for the years ended November 30, 2003 and 2002.

14.Financial Instruments  The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values
of financial instruments held by the Company at November 30, 2003 and 2002, using available market information and what the Company believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to
develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies might have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The table excludes cash, receivables and accounts payable, which had fair values approximating their carrying values.

The following methods
and assumptions are used by the Company in estimating fair values:  HomebuildingInvestments classified as trading included in other assets: The fair value is based on quoted market prices. Senior notes and other debts payable: The fair value of fixed rate borrowings is based on quoted market
prices. Variable rate borrowings are tied to market indices and therefore approximate fair value. Interest rate swaps: The fair value is based on dealer quotations and generally represents an estimate of the amount the Company would pay or receive
to terminate the agreement at the reporting date.  Financial
servicesThe fair values are based on quoted market prices, if available. The fair values for instruments which do not have quoted market prices are estimated by the Company on the basis of discounted cash flows or other financial
information.  The Company utilizes interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest costs and hedge against risks associated with changing interest rates. Counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty non-performance is not anticipated. A majority of
the Companys available variable rate borrowings are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR index. At November 30, 2003, the 
56  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Company had four interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a total notional amount of $300 million, which will mature at various dates through 2007.
These agreements fixed the LIBOR index at an average interest rate of 68% at November 30, 2003. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements on interest incurred and on the average interest rate was an increase of $167 million and 103% for the
year ended November 30, 2003, an increase of $170 million and 108% for the year ended November 30, 2002 and an increase of $72 million and 048% for the year ended November 30, 2001.  As of November 30, 2003, the Financial Services Divisions commitments regarding loans in process totaled approximately
$26 billion. To minimize credit risk, the Division uses the same credit policies in the approval of the commitments as are applied to all lending activities. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the
borrowers, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $3307 million as of November 30, 2003. Substantially all of
these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less.  Mandatory mortgage-backed securities forward commitments MBS are used by the Company to hedge its interest rate exposure during the period from when it makes an interest rate commitment to a loan applicant until the time at
which the loan is sold to an investor. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by entering into MBS only with investment banks with primary dealer status and with permanent
investors meeting the credit standards of the Company. At any time, the risk to the Company, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and current market value. At November 30, 2003, the Company had open
commitments amounting to $5120 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through January 2004.  15.Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, as further clarified and amended by the FASBs issuance of a revision to FIN 46 in December 2003, which
requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other
financial interests in the entity. Prior to the issuance of FIN 46, entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise when it had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. FIN 46 applied
immediately to variable interests created after January 31, 2003, and with respect to variable interests created before February 1, 2003, FIN 46 will apply in the Companys second quarter ending May 31, 2004, as deferred by the FASB in December
2003. Although the Company does not believe the full adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on net earnings, the Company cannot make any definitive determination until it completes its evaluation.  Partnerships  At November 30, 2003, the Company had investments in and advances to
partnerships established to acquire and develop land for sale to the Company in connection with its homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. The Company evaluated its partnership agreements entered into subsequent to January 31, 2003
under FIN 46. The Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of one partnership that was created after January 31, 2003, and, accordingly, included the accounts of that partnership in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. No
other partnerships created after January 31, 2003 were consolidated as the Company determined it was not the primary beneficiary, as defined under FIN 46. The Company is in the process of evaluating the remainder of its unconsolidated partnerships
that may be deemed variable interest entities under the provisions of FIN 46. At November 30, 2003, the Companys estimated maximum exposure to loss with regard to unconsolidated partnerships was its recorded investment in these partnerships
totaling $3903 million in addition to the exposure under the guarantees discussed in Note 5. 
57  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Option contracts  The Company evaluated its option contracts for land entered into subsequent to January 31, 2003 and determined it is the
primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although the Company does not have legal title to the optioned land, under FIN 46, the Company, as the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate the land under option at fair value the
exercise price. The effect of the consolidation was an increase of $452 million to consolidated inventory not owned with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet as of November 30, 2003. To reflect the fair value of the inventory consolidated under FIN 46, the Company reclassified $41 million of related option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned. The liabilities
related to consolidated inventory not owned represent the difference between the exercise price of the optioned land and the Companys deposits. The Company is in the process of evaluating the remainder of its option contracts that may be
deemed issued by variable interest entities under the provisions of FIN 46. At November 30, 2003, the Companys exposure to loss represents its non-refundable option deposits and/or letters of credit related to options with estimated aggregate
exercise prices totaling approximately $3 billion.  16.Commitments and Contingent Liabilities  The Company and its subsidiaries are party to various claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the disposition of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  The Company is subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase, development and
sale of real estate, which it does in the routine conduct of its business. Option contracts for the purchase of land permit the Company to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and certain unconsolidated partnerships until
the Company is ready to build homes on them. The use of option contracts allows the Company to reduce the financial risk of adverse market conditions associated with long-term land holdings. At November 30, 2003, the Company had access to acquire
approximately 135,000 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated partnerships. At November 30, 2003, the Company had $2206 million of non-refundable option deposits and advanced costs on real estate related to certain of these homesites.
The Company has entered into agreements to lease certain
office facilities and equipment under operating leases. Future minimum payments under the noncancelable leases are as follows: 2004$480 million; 2005$382 million; 2006$310 million; 2007$243 million; 2008$163
million and thereafter$349 million. Rental expense for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $632 million, $550 million and $423 million, respectively.  The Company is committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and
provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $6279 million at November 30, 2003. The Company also had outstanding performance and surety bonds with estimated costs to
complete of $10 billion related principally to its obligations for site improvements at various projects at November 30, 2003. The Company does not believe that draws upon these bonds, if any, will have a material effect on the Companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

17.Supplemental Financial Information  As discussed in Note 7, the Companys obligations to pay principal,
premium, if any, and interest under certain debt instruments are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of the Companys subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities.
The guarantees are full and unconditional and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly or indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. The Company has determined that separate, full financial statements of the guarantors would not be material to
investors and, accordingly, supplemental financial information for the guarantors is presented.  Consolidating Balance Sheet November 30, 2003  LennarCorporation GuarantorSubsidiaries
