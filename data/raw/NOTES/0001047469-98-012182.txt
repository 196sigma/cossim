ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
@ Entertainment, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of @
Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
1997. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of @
Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America.

@ ENTERTAINMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
1. ORGANIZATION AND FORMATION OF HOLDING COMPANY
@ Entertainment, Inc. @ Entertainment was established as a Delaware
corporation in May 1997. @ Entertainment succeeded Poland Communications, Inc.
PCI as the group holding company to facilitate an initial public offering of
stock in the United States and internationally the IPO. PCI was founded in
1990 by David T. Chase, a Polish-born investor.
@ Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company offers pay
television services to business and residential customers in Poland. Its
revenues are derived primarily from installation fees and monthly basic and
premium service fees for cable television services provided primarily to
residential, rather than business, customers. The Company intends to launch a
digital satellite direct-to-home D-DTH broadcasting service throughout
Poland during the first half of 1998. In addition to developing and acquiring
programming for distribution on its cable television networks, the Company
intends to expand its programming by launching, simultaneously with its D-DTH
launch, a branded digital encrypted platform of Polish-language programming
under the brand name Wizja TV.
At December 31, 1997, @ Entertainment wholly owns PCI, At Entertainment
Limited @EL and Sereke Holding B.V. Sereke which are United States,
United Kingdom and Netherlands corporations, respectively. PCI owns 923% of the
capital stock of Poland Cablevision Netherlands B.V. PCBV, a Netherlands
corporation and first-tier subsidiary of PCI. @ Entertainment, PCI and PCBV are
holding companies that directly or indirectly hold controlling interests in a
number of Polish cable television companies, collectively referred to as the
PTK Companies. @EL and Sereke were established during 1997 to develop and
operate, in association with other subsidiaries, a D-DTH broadcasting service
and Polish-language programming under the brand name Wizja TV. As of December
31, 1997, substantially all of the assets and operating activities of the
Company were located in Poland and the United Kingdom.
The following is a description of the events leading up to the formation of
@ Entertainment.
PCI had outstanding at December 31, 1995, 985 shares of preferred stock,
which was convertible into 812 shares of Class A common stock. PCI had the
option of redeeming the preferred stock in whole or in part from January 1, 1996
through December 31, 2002. However, as discussed below, the preferred stock was
exchanged for new series D preferred stock during March 1996.
During February 1996, PCI issued to certain stockholders an additional 2,437
shares of Class A common stock in accordance with the provisions of the
Shareholder Agreement dated June 27, 1991. The shares were issued at a nominal
value of $01 each. Also during February 1996, PCI issued a stock dividend of
166 shares of series A preferred stock to the preferred stock stockholder.
During March 1996, PCI completed several transactions including restating
its certificate of incorporation, issuing new shares of stock, redeeming
preferred stock, and the repayment of affiliate debt. The restated certificate
of incorporation of PCI authorized a new class of $01 par common stock, $1 par
series A preferred stock, $01 par series B preferred stock, $01 par series C
preferred stock, and $01 par series D preferred stock. All shares of Class A
and Class B common stock previously issued and outstanding were exchanged for
new common stock. All issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock were
exchanged for new series D preferred stock, which was subsequently redeemed for
$8,500,000. Only common stock and series B preferred stock retained voting
rights and only holders of common stock were entitled to receive dividends. Each
series of preferred stock has redemption provisions; the series B preferred
stock was also convertible into common stock.

@ ENTERTAINMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
1. ORGANIZATION AND FORMATION OF HOLDING COMPANY CONTINUED
During March 1996, PCI issued 4,662 shares of common stock, 4,000 shares of
series A preferred stock, and 2,500 shares of series B preferred stock to ECO
Holdings III Limited Partnership ECO in exchange for $65,000,000; and 2,000
shares of series C preferred stock and 812 shares of common stock were issued to
Polish Investments Holding Limited Partnership PIHLP in exchange for
$17,029,000.
The PCI series A, series B and series C preferred stock have a mandatory
redemption date of October 31, 2004. At the option of the Company, the PCI
series A, series B and series C preferred stock may be redeemed at any time in
whole or in part at a redemption price per share of $10,000. Prior to the
mandatory redemption of the PCI series B preferred stock, the holders of any
shares of PCI series B preferred stock had the option to convert their shares to
4,862 shares of PCI common stock. The preferred stock was recorded at its
mandatory redemption value on October 31, 2004, discounted at 12%, of
$32,156,000.
On June 22, 1997, all the holders of shares of PCI common stock and @
Entertainment entered into a Contribution Agreement. Pursuant to the
Contribution Agreement, each holder of shares of PCI common stock transferred
all shares of PCI common stock owned by it to @ Entertainment. In addition, ECO
transferred all of the outstanding shares of PCI series B preferred stock to @
Entertainment. All of these transfers the Share Exchange were designed to
qualify as a tax-free exchange under section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. Each holder of PCI common stock received 1,000 shares of
common stock of @ Entertainment in exchange for each share of PCI common stock
transferred by it the Capital Adjustment. ECO also received an equivalent
number of shares of @ Entertainment series B preferred stock in exchange for
its shares of PCI series B preferred stock. @ Entertainment series B
preferred stock has identical rights and preferences to those of PCI series B
preferred stock, except that the ratio for conversion of such shares into common
stock increased from 1:19448 to 1:1,94480 in order to reflect the Capital
Adjustment. The 2,500 outstanding shares of @ Entertainment series B preferred
stock automatically converted into 4,862,000 shares of common stock of @
Entertainment upon the closing of the IPO. The formation of @ Entertainment has
been accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to pooling of interest
accounting.
On June 20, 1997, PIHLP transferred all of the outstanding shares of PCI
series C preferred stock to an entity owned by certain of the beneficial owners
of PIHLP and members of their families the Chase Entity. The Chase Entity,
ECO and @ Entertainment entered into a Purchase Agreement dated June 22, 1997
the Purchase Agreement. Among other matters, the Purchase Agreement
obligated @ Entertainment to purchase all of the outstanding shares of PCI
series A preferred stock and series C preferred stock for cash from ECO and the
Chase Entity, respectively, at the closing of the IPO. The aggregate purchase
price of $60,000,000 for PCI series A preferred stock and series C preferred
stock equaled the aggregate redemption price of such shares as set forth in
PCI certificate of incorporation. The purchase resulted in a loss applicable
to common stockholders of $33,806,000 representing the excess of the
consideration paid for the preferred stock over the carrying amount of those
shares as of the date of the Reorganization as defined hereinafter. The
aforementioned purchase was funded with a portion of the net proceeds of the
IPO.
The Company periodically accreted, until the date of the purchases described
above, from paid-in capital an amount that would provide for the redemption
value of the PCI series A, B and C preferred shares at October 31, 2004. The
total amounts recorded for accretion for the years ended December 31, 1997 and
1996 were $2,436,000 and $2,870,000, respectively.

@ ENTERTAINMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
1. ORGANIZATION AND FORMATION OF HOLDING COMPANY CONTINUED
In June 1997, @ Entertainment acquired all of the outstanding stock of @EL,
a new corporation organized under the laws of England and Wales the @EL
Incorporation.
In June 1997, certain employment agreements for the executive officers of @
Entertainment who were employed by PCI and their employee stock option
agreements were assigned to @ Entertainment by PCI the Assignment. As part
of the Assignment and the Capital Adjustment, the employment agreements were
amended to provide that each option to purchase a share of PCI common stock
was exchanged for an option to purchase 1,000 shares of @ Entertainment common
stock with a proportionate reduction in the per share exercise price.
The Share Exchange, Capital Adjustment, @EL Incorporation and the Assignment
are collectively referred to as the Reorganization. As a result of the
Reorganization, @ Entertainment owns 100% of the outstanding shares of common
stock and preferred stock of PCI and 100% of @EL.
On August 5, 1997, the Company consummated an initial public offering of
9,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $21 per share. Net proceeds to
the Company were approximately $183,292,000 after deduction of the underwriting
discount and other expenses of the offering.
2. FINANCIAL POSITION AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis which contemplates the continuation and expansion of trading
activities as well as the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities
in the ordinary course of business. Cable television operators typically
experience losses and negative cash flow in their initial years of operation due
to the large capital investment required for the construction or acquisition of
their cable networks and the administrative costs associated with commencing
operations. Consistent with this pattern, the Company has incurred substantial
operating losses since inception. The Company expects to experience substantial
operating losses and negative cash flows for at least the next two years in
association with the expansion of the D-DTH and programming businesses.
Additionally, the Company is currently and is expected to continue to be highly
leveraged. The ability of the Company to meet its debt service obligations will
depend on the future operating performance and financial results of the Company
as well as its ability to obtain additional financing to support the planned
expansion.
Management of the Company believes that significant opportunities exist for
pay television providers capable of delivering high quality, Polish-language
programming on a multi-channel basis. As such, the Company has focused its
financial and business efforts toward its position in the cable, D-DTH and
programming markets. The Company business strategy is designed to increase its
market share and subscriber base and to maximize revenue per subscriber. To
accomplish its objectives and to capitalize on its competitive advantages, the
Company intends to i control content on its cable and D-DTH systems; ii grow
its distribution capabilities; iii control its own subscriber management with
advanced integrated management information systems; and iv establish Wizja TV
as the leading brand name in the Polish pay television industry. The Company is
dependent on obtaining new financing to achieve its business strategy and is
currently exploring methods of raising additional capital. If not successful,
the Company will be required to reduce the scope of its presently anticipated
expansion of operations, reduce capital and operating expenditures, including
invoking cancellation rights under certain agreements, and as a result the
business, results of operations and prospects of the Company could be adversely
affected. Management

2. FINANCIAL POSITION AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING CONTINUED
believes that cash on hand and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund
its reduced plan for the next twelve months assuming the debt offering is not
successful and, accordingly, consider it appropriate to prepare the consolidated
financial statements on a going concern basis.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America U.S. GAAP.
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of @
Entertainment, Inc. and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. Also
consolidated is a 49% owned subsidiary for which the Company maintains control
of operating activities and has the ability to influence the appointment of
members to the Managing Board. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and other short-term investments
with original maturities of less than three months.
USE OF ESTIMATES
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in
conformity with U.S. GAAP. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is primarily derived from the sale of cable television services to
retail customers in Poland. Revenue from subscription fees is recognized on a
monthly basis as the service is provided. Installation fee revenue, for
connection to the Company cable television systems, is recognized to the
extent of direct selling costs and the balance is deferred and amortized to
income over the estimated average period that new subscribers are expected to
remain connected to the systems.
In association with the launch of the Company D-DTH broadcasting service
and branded digital encrypted platform of Polish-language programming under the
brand name Wizja TV during the first half of 1998, the Company intends to begin
distributing its own programming on both its D-DTH and cable television
networks. Such distribution of programming will provide two sources of revenue
for the Company: subscriber-based programming fees and advertising revenue. As
of December 31, 1997, no programming or advertising revenue related to the
D-DTH/Wizja TV launch has been earned or recognized.
TAXATION
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement

DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.
U.S. TAXATION:
The Company and PCI are subject to U.S. federal income taxation on its
worldwide income. The PTK Companies and PCBV are foreign corporations, which
are not engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. or to derive income
from U.S. sources and accordingly, are not subject to U.S. income tax.
FOREIGN TAXATION:
The PTK Companies are subject to corporate income taxes, value added tax
VAT and various local taxes within Poland, as well as import duties on
materials imported by them into Poland. Under Polish law, the PTK Companies
are exempt from import duties on certain in-kind capital contributions.
The PTK Companies' income tax is calculated in accordance with Polish
tax regulations. Due to differences between accounting practices under
Polish tax regulations and those required by U.S. GAAP, certain income and
expense items are recognized in different periods for financial reporting
purposes and income tax reporting purposes which may result in deferred
income tax assets and liabilities.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES
Investment securities outstanding at December 31, 1996, consist of
short-term investments with original maturities ranging from four to six months.
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115,
ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, the Company
has classified all securities as held to maturity. Securities held to maturity
are limited to securities for which the Company has the positive intent and the
ability to hold to maturity. Held to maturity securities are carried at
amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheet.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment includes assets used in the development of the
D-DTH system. As of December 31, 1997, all of the Company investment in D-DTH
television systems was recorded as construction in progress. Accordingly, such
investment will commence depreciation upon the expected substantial completion
of such systems during the first half of 1998.
Property, plant and equipment also includes assets used in the development
and operation of the various cable television systems. During the period of
construction, plant costs and a portion of design, development and related
overhead costs are capitalized as a component of the Company investment in
cable television systems. When material, the Company capitalizes interest costs
incurred during the period of construction in accordance with SFAS No. 34,
CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST COST. Interest is not capitalized for short-term
construction projects. During 1997, 1996 and 1995, no interest costs were
capitalized.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Cable subscriber related costs and the Company general and administrative
expenses are charged to operations when incurred.
Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
Cable television system    10 years
5 years
Other property, plant and  5--10 years
INVENTORIES FOR CONSTRUCTION
Inventories for construction are stated at the lower of cost, determined by
the average cost method, or net realizable value. Inventories are principally
related to work-in-progress in the various cable television systems.
GOODWILL
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of
net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
periods to be benefited, generally ten years.
INTANGIBLES
During 1997, the Company entered into contracts for the purchase of certain
exhibition or broadcast rights. Broadcast or exhibition rights consist
principally of rights to broadcast syndicated programs, sports and feature films
and are accounted for as a purchase of rights by the licensee. The asset and
liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred under a license
agreement are reported by the Company, at the gross amount of the liability,
when the license period begins and certain specified conditions have been met,
in accordance with the guidelines established within SFAS No. 63, FINANCIAL
REPORTING BY BROADCASTERS.
Broadcast rights that have limited showings will be generally amortized
using an accelerated method as programs are aired based on the estimated number
of showings. Capitalized costs relating to broadcast rights with unlimited
showings will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.
As the broadcast rights were purchased to correspond with the Company
launch of its D-DTH and Wizja TV programming platform during the first half of
1998, all of the costs incurred as of year end, approximately $894,000, were
recorded as a prepayment within other current assets at December 31, 1997 and
such rights will become available for broadcast during 1998.
Through its subsidiaries, the Company has entered into lease agreements with
the Polish national telephone company TPSA, for the use of underground
telephone conduits for cable wiring. Costs related to obtaining conduit and
franchise agreements with housing cooperatives and governmental authorities are
capitalized and amortized generally over a period of ten years. In the event the
Company does not proceed to develop cable systems within designated cities,
costs previously capitalized will be charged to expense.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Costs incurred to obtain financing have been deferred and amortized over the
life of the loan using the effective interest method.
INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND JOINT VENTURES RELATING TO THIRD
PARTY PROGRAMMING
In some instances, the Company purchases an equity interest in the
programming it distributes, typically by investing in the entity which produces
that particular programming for distribution in Poland, and by sharing the costs
and expenses incurred in the creation of the Polish-language version of that
particular programming. In these cases, the investment is accounted for under
the equity method in accordance with guidance established within Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 18.
MINORITY INTEREST
Recognition of the minority interests' share of losses of consolidated
subsidiaries is limited to the amount of such minority interests' allocable
portion of the equity of those consolidated subsidiaries.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION, which gives companies the option to adopt the fair value based
method for expense recognition of employee stock options and other stock-based
awards or to account for such items using the intrinsic value method as outlined
under APB Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, with pro
forma disclosure of net loss and loss per share as if the fair value method had
been applied. The Company has elected to apply APB Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations for stock options and other stock-based awards.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing
at the date of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are remeasured at rates of exchange at consolidated balance sheet
date. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in the
consolidated statement of operations.
Translation of the financial statements of the Polish subsidiaries into U.S.
dollars has been performed in accordance with SFAS No. 52, FOREIGN CURRENCY
TRANSLATION. This standard requires that entities operating in countries with
economies deemed to be highly inflationary translate all monetary assets and
liabilities into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at year end and
non-monetary assets and liabilities at historical or transaction date rates.
Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate over the
reporting period. For 1996, 1995 and 1994 inflation was 199%, 268% and 333 respectively, yielding a three-year cumulative inflation rate of 1027%.
Effective January 1, 1998, Poland is no longer deemed to be a highly
inflationary economy. In accordance with this change, the Company will establish
a new functional currency basis for non-monetary items in accordance with
guidelines established within EITF Issue 92-4, ACCOUNTING FOR A CHANGE IN
FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY WHEN AN ECONOMY CEASES TO BE CONSIDERED HIGHLY
INFLATIONARY. That basis is computed by translating the historical reporting
currency amounts of nonmonetary items into the local currency at current
exchange rates.

BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE
The Company, effective for the year ended December 31, 1997, adopted SFAS
No. 128 EARNINGS PER SHARE. Accordingly, 1996 and 1995 per share calculations
have been restated to conform with this statement. Pursuant to the provisions of
the statement, basic loss per share has been computed by dividing net loss
attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. The effect of potential common shares is
antidilutive, accordingly, dilutive loss per share is the same as basic loss per
share.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
SFAS No. 107, DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
requires the Company to make disclosures of fair value information of all
financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the consolidated balance
sheets, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.
The Company financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, notes receivable from affiliates, accounts payable and
accrued expenses, other current liabilities, and notes payable.
At December 31, 1997, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
investment securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses, and other current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
At December 31, 1997, the fair value of the Company notes payable balance
approximates $128,420,000, based on the last trading price of the notes payable
in 1997. It was not practicable to estimate the fair value of notes receivable
from affiliates due to the nature of these instruments, the circumstances
surrounding their issuance, and the absence of quoted market prices for similar
financial instruments.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets mainly
property, plant and equipment, intangibles and certain other assets by
determining whether the carrying value of the assets can be recovered over the
remaining lives through projected undiscounted future operating cash flows,
expected to be generated by such assets. If an impairment in value is estimated
to have occurred, the assets carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair
value. The assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets will be
impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments,
litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can
be reasonably estimated.
ADVERTISING COSTS
All advertising costs of the Company are expensed as incurred.

RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts have been reclassified in the prior year consolidated
financial statements to conform to the 1997 consolidated financial statement
presentation.
IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED
SFAS No. 130, REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, was issued in June 1997 and
establishes standards for the reporting and presentation of comprehensive income
and its components in a full set of financial statements. Comprehensive income
encompasses all changes in stockholders' equity except those arising from
transactions with owners and includes net income, net unrealized capital gains
or losses on available for sale securities and foreign currency translation
adjustments. As this new standard only requires additional information in
financial statements, it will not affect the Company financial position or
results of operations. SFAS No. 130 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1997, with earlier application permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the presentation alternatives permitted by the statement.
SFAS No. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT A SEGMENT OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED
INFORMATION, was issued in June 1997 and establishes standards for the
reporting of information relating to operating segments in annual financial
statements, as well as disclosure of selected information in interim financial
reports. This statement supersedes SFAS No. 14, FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR
SEGMENTS OF A BUSINESS ENTERPRISE, which requires reporting segment information
by industry and geographic area industry approach. Under SFAS No. 131,
operating segments are defined as components of a company for which separate
financial information is available and used by management to allocate resources
and assess performance management approach. This statement is effective for
year end 1998 financial statements. Interim financial information will be
required beginning in 1999 with comparative 1998 information. The Company does
not anticipate that this standard will significantly impact the composition of
its current operating segments, which are consistent with the management
approach.
4. INVESTMENT SECURITIES
At December 31, 1996, investment securities consisted of short-term
corporate bonds with original maturities ranging from four to six months. As of
December 31, 1996, the aggregate securities balance consisted of securities with
an amortized cost of $25,115,000, unrealized holding gains of $227,000, and a
fair value of $25,342,000. All such investment securities matured during 1997,
and as of December 31, 1997, certain amounts previously invested in investment
securities are invested in cash and cash equivalents.

Effective January 1, 1997, the Company acquired the remaining 51% of a
subsidiary company for aggregate consideration of approximately $9,927,000. The
acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase with the purchase price
allocated among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the fair
values at the date of acquisition and any excess to goodwill. The purchase price
exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by approximately $5,556,000.
In May 1997, the Company acquired a 5475% ownership interest in a cable
television company for aggregate consideration of approximately $10,925,000. The
acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase with the purchase price
allocated among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the fair
values at the date of acquisition and any excess as goodwill. The results of the
acquired company have been included with the Company results since the date of
acquisition. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets
acquired by approximately $9,910,000. Included in minority interest at December
31, 1997 is approximately $450,000 relating to the acquisition of this
subsidiary.
Had these acquisitions occurred on January 1, 1996, the Company pro-forma

Additionally, during 1997 the Company acquired certain cable television
system assets for aggregate consideration of approximately $3,200,000. The
acquisitions have been accounted for as fixed asset purchases with the purchase
price allocated among the fixed assets acquired based upon their fair values at
the dates of acquisition and any excess to goodwill. The purchase prices
exceeded the fair value of the assets acquired by approximately $548,000.
During 1996, the Company acquired substantially all of the cable television
system assets of twenty-six cable television companies for aggregate
consideration of approximately $15,600,000. The acquisitions

accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1996.
During 1995, the Company acquired four cable television companies for
aggregate consideration of approximately $4,075,000. The acquisitions have been
accounted for as purchases with the purchase price allocated among the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the fair values at the date of
acquisition and any excess as goodwill. The results of the acquired companies

Also included in other non-current assets at December 31, 1997 is a
prepayment of approximately $1,200,000 toward the formation of a
programming-related joint venture with World Shopping Network Plc. Although the
agreement has not yet been finalized, the Company intent is to invest in a new
joint venture created to produce shopping television network programming for
distribution in Poland, and share the costs and expenses incurred in the
creation of the Polish-language version of that particular programming. There
can be no assurance that the agreement with World Shopping Network will be
finalized, in which case the $1,200,000 payment will be expensed.
Included in other non-current assets at December 31, 1996 is a prepayment of
approximately $6,000,000 to the 51% shareholder of one of the PTK Companies
pursuant to an agreement for the purchase of his interest in the PTK Company.
This prepayment was subsequently offset against the purchase price upon the
transfer of all of his 51% interest in the PTK Company to the Company effective
January 1, 1997.
9. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES
Investments in affiliated companies consist of 20% of the common stock of
Fox Kids Poland Ltd, 50% of the common stock of Twoj Styl Sp. z o.o. Twoj
Styl, 33% of the common stock of ProCable Sp. z o.o. and 45% of the common
stock of Ground Zero Media Sp. z o.o. GZM, all of which are accounted for
using the equity method.
On September 25, 1997, the Company signed a share purchase agreement for a
50% interest in Twoj Styl. Twoj Styl publishes a Polish-language lifestyle
magazine. In addition, the Company agreed to provide additional future financing
to Twoj Styl, either debt or equity, of up to $7,700,000 to develop Polish-
language programming and ancillary services.
In December 1997, the Company entered into a joint venture with Saban
International N.V. SINV for a 20% equity interest in Fox Kids Poland Ltd.
for the purpose of producing Fox Kids programming for distribution in Poland.
Under the terms of the agreement, the joint venture partners will share the
costs and expenses incurred in the creation of the Polish language version of
the programming.
The aggregate consideration paid for investments in affiliated companies
during 1997 was $21,420,000.
In April 1997, PCI reached an agreement in principle with GZM whereby PCI
assumed responsibility for selling all advertising to be aired on Atomic TV for
a period of one year commencing April 1997. Atomic TV is a Polish-language music
television channel owned by GZM, which began to be broadcast via satellite to
Poland on April 7, 1997. Under the terms of the agreement, PCI has the right to
receive all of the funds generated from advertising sales, and in exchange, PCI
pays GZM $4,950,000. During 1997, $3,700,000 was charged to selling, general and
administrative expenses with respect to this contract of which $450,000 is
accrued at December 31, 1997. The fees charged to the Company for these rights
are set at the level of fees that GZM would charge to unrelated parties.
Subsequent to year end, the Company acquired the remaining shares of GZM.
It was not practicable to estimate the market value of the investments in
affiliate companies due to the nature of these investments, the relatively short
existence of the investee companies, and the absence of quoted market prices for
the investee companies.

The net increase in the valuation allowance for the years ended December 31,
1997, 1996 and 1995 was $15,424,000, $3,504,000, and $667,000, respectively. In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets

will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections
for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are
deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will not
realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing
valuation allowances at December 31, 1997.
Subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets as of December 31, 1997 will be reported in the consolidated
statement of operations.
Foreign loss carryforwards can be offset against the PTK Companies' taxable
income and utilized at a rate of one-third per year in each of the three years
subsequent to the year of the loss. If there is no taxable income in a given
year during the carryforward period, the portion of the loss carryforward to be
utilized is permanently forfeited. For losses incurred in U.S. taxable years
prior to 1998, loss carryforwards can be applied against taxable income three
years retroactively and fifteen years into the future.
At December 31, 1997, the Company has foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $19,019,000 which will expire as follows:

16. STOCK OPTION PLAN CONTINUED
2,000,000 remain subject to stockholders approval, subject to adjustment in
accordance with the 1997 Plan. At December 31, 1997, options for 2,574,000
shares had been granted of which 138,000 remain subject to stockholders
approval and 1,862,000 shares remained available for future grants subject to
stockholders approval. Of this amount, 1,671,000 options became exercisable
upon the IPO but cannot be sold for a period of two years from July 30, 1997.
Subsequent to December 31, 1997, options for a further 1,150,000 shares had
been granted which are all also subject to stockholder approval.
The Company granted 1,671,000 stock options in January 1997 at a price
substantially below the IPO price of $2100 per share. Such options vested in
full upon the completion of the IPO. In accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, the Company recognized approximately $18,102,000 of
compensation expense included in selling, general, and administrative expenses
for these options in 1997 representing the difference between the exercise price
of the options and their fair market value of the shares on the date of grant.
All other stock options were granted with exercise prices at or below the fair
market value of the shares on the date of grant.
Future stock options are granted with an exercise price that must be at
least equal to the stock fair market value at the date of grant. With respect
to any participant who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the voting power
of all classes of stock of the Company, the exercise price of any incentive
stock option granted must equal at least 110% of the fair market value on the
grant date and the maximum term of an incentive stock option must not exceed

BUILDING LEASES
The Company leases several offices and warehouses within Poland under
cancelable operating leases. The Company has a noncancelable operating lease for
a building in the United Kingdom which houses the majority of its technical
equipment relating to the D-DTH network. The noncancelable lease expires in
2002, and contains a renewal option for an additional five years. Future minimum
lease payments as of December 31, 1997 are $1,649,000 in 1998, $1,649,000 in
1999, $1,649,000 in 2000, $1,649,000 in 2001 and $1,649,000 in 2002.
D-DTH TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT LEASE
The Company has an eight year agreement with British Telecommunications plc
BT for the lease and maintenance of certain satellite uplink equipment. The
agreement requires the payment of equal monthly installments of $50,000
approximating future minimum commitments of $600,000 in 1998, $600,000 in 1999 600,000 in 2000, $600,000 in 2001, $600,000 in 2002 and $1,800,000 in 2003 and
thereafter. Other than the BT uplink equipment, the Company owns all of the
required broadcasting equipment at its transmission facility in the United
Kingdom.
CONDUIT LEASES
The Company also leases space within various telephone duct systems from
TPSA under cancelable operating leases. The TPSA leases expire at various times,
and a substantial portion of the Company contracts with TPSA permit
termination by TPSA without penalty at any time either immediately upon the
occurrence of certain conditions or upon provision of three to six months notice
without cause. Refer to Note 19 for further detail. All of the agreements
provide that TPSA is the manager of the telephone duct system and will lease
space within the ducts to the Company for installation of cable and equipment
for the cable television systems. The lease agreements provide for monthly lease
payments that are adjusted quarterly or annually, except for the Gdansk lease
agreement which provides for an annual adjustment after the sixth year and then
remains fixed through the tenth year of the lease.

17. LEASES CONTINUED
Minimum future lease commitments for the aforementioned conduit leases
relate to 1998 only, as all leases are cancelable in accordance with the
aforementioned terms. The future minimum lease commitments related to these
conduit leases approximates $466,000 for the year ending December 31, 1998.
TRANSPONDER LEASES
During 1997, the Company entered into certain operating leases pursuant to
which the Company is liable for charges associated with each of its three
transponders on the Astra satellites, which can amount to a maximum of
$6,750,000 per year for each transponder and up to $200 million for all three
transponders for the term of their leases. The future minimum lease payments
applicable to the transponders approximate $$6,791,000 in 1998, $7,940,000 in
1999, $7,940,000 in 2000, $7,940,000 in 2001, $7,940,000 in 2002 and $33,745,000
in 2003 and thereafter. The leases for the two transponders on the Astra 1F
satellite and the transponder on the Astra 1G satellite will expire in 2007.
Either party to the transactions may terminate any or all of the transponder
leases with 6 months notice if the Company has not targeted the Polish D-DTH
market prior to January 1, 1999. If all of the leases had been terminated at
December 31, 1997, the maximum aggregate charges under the leases would have
approximated $8,700,000. The Company transponder leases provide that the
Company rights are subject to termination in the event that the lessor
franchise is withdrawn by the Luxembourg Government.
Total rental expense associated with the aforementioned operating leases for
the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $3,696,000, $892,000 and
$711,000, respectively.
18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
PURCHASE COMMITMENTS
The Company has concluded an agreement with Philips, whereby Philips would
supply Reception Systems, as well as retail, installation and support services
in connection with the launch of the Company D-DTH Business in Poland. Philips
will be the exclusive supplier to the Company of the first 500,000 D-DTH
Reception Systems and will not distribute any other digital integrated receiver
decoders under the Philips trademark in Poland until September 1, 1999 or any
earlier date on which the Company has secured 500,000 initial subscribers to its
D-DTH service in Poland. Philips has granted the Company an exclusive license of
its CryptoWorks-Registered Trademark- technology in Poland for the term of the
agreement, which will terminate when the Company has purchased 500,000 D-DTH
Reception Systems from Philips, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the
terms of the agreement or extended by mutual consent of Philips and the Company.
The aggregate cost of the agreement with Philips is estimated to approximate
$200,000,000 or up to $400 per Reception System for the first 500,000
subscribers. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had paid $9,000,000 to Philips
as a prepayment toward the purchase of the Reception Systems which has been
included in other assets. The Reception Systems will be capitalized and included
as part of property, plant and equipment and leased to subscribers under
operating lease arrangements.
BROADCAST/EXHIBITION RIGHT COMMITMENTS
The Company has entered into long-term contracts for the purchase of certain
exhibition or broadcast rights for its D-DTH and cable systems. The contracts
have terms which range from one to five years and require that the license fees
be paid based upon a fixed amount. The Company has an aggregate minimum

18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED
commitment of approximately $17,437,000 over the next 5 years, approximating
$6,590,000 in 1998, $2,580,000 in 1999, $4,185,000 in 2000, $2,488,000 in 2001
and $1,594,000 in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company
incurred no amortization expense relating to these broadcast/exhibition rights
pursuant to these agreements since all balances were recorded as other current
assets as of December 31, 1997. The Company did not incur any amortization
expense relating to broadcast/exhibition rights during 1996 or 1995.
Subsequent to December 31, 1997, the Company entered into additional
exhibition or broadcast rights under which the Company has a minimum commitment
of approximately $2,846,000 in 1998, $2,226,000 in 1999, $949,000 in 2000, and
$43,000 in 2001.
PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS
The Company has entered into long-term programming agreements with a number
of third party content providers for its D-DTH and cable systems. The
programming agreements have terms which range from one to five years and require
that the license fees be paid either at a fixed amount payable at the time of
execution or based upon a guaranteed minimum number of subscribers connected to
the system each month. The Company has an aggregate minimum commitment of
approximately $74,327,000 over the next 5 years, approximating $9,303,000 in
1998, $11,591,000 in 1999, $15,349,000 in 2000, $17,910,000 in 2001 and
$20,174,000 in 2002. The Company is in the process of negotiating additional
long-term programming agreements with other third party content providers. For
the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company incurred
programming fees of approximately $1,895,000, $1,758,000 and $1,318,000,
respectively, pursuant to these agreements.
Subsequent to December 31, 1997, the Company entered into additional
long-term programming agreements under which the Company has a minimum
commitment of approximately $792,000 in 1998, $1,659,000 in 1999, $2,171,000 in
2000, $2,409,000 in 2001 and $1,446,000 in 2002. The Company is in the process
of negotiating additional long-term programming agreements with other third
party content providers, which agreements if consummated, may require the
Company to pay additional guaranteed minimum payments and/or payments at the
time of execution. Management estimates any additional commitments resulting
from these negotiations will be approximately $1,609,000 in 1998, $3,112,000 in
1998, $3,816,000 in 2000, $2,300,000 in 2001, $1,116,000 in 2002, and $565,000
in 2003 and thereafter.
CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER COMMITMENT
The Company intends to establish a centralized customer service center. The
call center function of the customer service center will be operational for
D-DTH customers in April 1998 and for the majority of cable customers by the end
of 1998. The billing center function of the Customer Service center will be
operational for D-DTH customers in May 1998 and for the majority of cable
customers by the end of 1998. Management estimates capital expenditures
associated with the establishment of the center will approximate $7,880,000. The
center will be located in a low-cost area of Poland and will consolidate the
functions of the Company existing regional customer service centers, and the
Company believes the centralization of service functions in one location will
improve the general level of customer service available to subscribers.

CAPITAL COMMITMENTS
As of December 31, 1997, the Company entered into commitments to purchase
capital assets of approximately $6,179,000 for 1998.
CONSULTING AGREEMENTS
Subsequent to December 31, 1997, the Company has entered into consulting
agreements with two of its directors pursuant to which the Company is committed
to pay a minimum of $960,000 in each of 1998 and 1999. During 1997, the Company
incurred no expenses relating to these agreements.
REGULATORY APPROVALS
The Company is in the process of obtaining permits from the Polish State
Agency for Radiocommunications PAR for several of its cable television
systems. If these permits are not obtained, PAR could impose penalties such as
fines or in severe cases, revocation of all permits held by an operator or the
forfeiture of the operator cable networks. Management of the Company does not
believe that these pending approvals result in a significant risk to the
Company.
One of the PTK Companies was not able to register several capital increases
that were filed in 1995, for an aggregate amount of PLN 2,000,000 approximately
$569,000 at the December 31, 1997 conversion rate. The capital increases were
rejected by the relevant Registration Court, and the court decision was upheld
on appeal. Since the PTK Company received an in-kind contribution of equipment
in respect of the proposed capital increases, the non-recognition of the capital
increases by the Polish courts means that the contribution could be treated as
income in the hands of the PTK Company. As a result, part or all of the
contribution could be subject to corporate income tax of 40%. The PTK Company
had enough tax net operating loss in 1995 to offset any additional taxable
income resulting from an unfavorable treatment. The Company has not recorded any
amounts related to this in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
due to the tax net operating loss and uncertainties involved.
LITIGATION AND CLAIMS
Two of the Company cable television subsidiaries and four other unrelated
Polish cable operators and HBO Polska Sp. z o.o., have been made defendants in a
lawsuit instituted by Polska Korporacja Telewizyjna Sp. z o.o., a subsidiary of
Canal+. The primary defendant in the proceedings is HBO Polska Sp. z o.o. which
is accused of broadcasting the HBO television program in Poland without a
license from the Council as required by the Radio and Television Act of 1992, as
amended, and thereby undertaking an activity constituting an act of unfair
competition. The Company does not believe that the final disposition of the
lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
Several of the minority stockholders of PCBV have claimed that the behavior
of PCBV and its majority stockholder, PCI, have prejudiced them, and that PCI
has through its direct and indirect ownership interests in a number of entities
that engage in certain aspects of the cable television business in Poland
violated certain covenants against competition in the PCBV Stockholders'
agreement, and that under the circumstances, they can no longer be expected to
remain shareholders of PCBV. The PCBV Stockholders' Agreement includes certain
covenants against competition that limit the ability of each
87

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED
shareholder to engage directly or indirectly in any aspect of the cable
television business in Poland for a period ending ten years after such
stockholder ceases to be a stockholder. PCI has direct or indirect ownership
interests in a number of entities that engage in certain aspects of the cable
television business in Poland. Under the Stockholders' Agreement, the minority
stockholders of PCBV have a claim against 77% of the profits and equity of such
entities. Under a supplemental agreement, PCI has agreed to share the future
profits of the competing cable companies on a pro rata basis. As at December 31,
1997, no amounts have been incurred.
From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and suits
arising out of the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate result of all
such matters is not presently determinable, based upon current knowledge and
facts, management does not expect that their resolution will have a material
adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
19. CONCENTRATIONS OF BUSINESS AND CREDIT RISK
D-DTH BUSINESS
The Company expects that its D-DTH business will incur substantial operating
losses for at least two years of operation while it is developed and expanded.
The magnitude and duration of the losses to be incurred on its D-DTH business
will depend on, among other factors, the ability of the Company D-DTH service
to attract and retain subscribers, the total cost of providing affordable
reception equipment to subscribers, the Company ability to develop and
maintain a successful programming platform for the Polish market and its ability
to control other costs which do not vary with the number of subscribers. The
Company may require additional external funding for its business development
plans if it continues to provide promotional incentives to subscribers with
respect to the cost of the D-DTH Reception Systems to subscribers other than the
500,000 initial subscribers. There can be no assurance that the roll-out of the
D-DTH business will proceed as planned, or that if achieved, the increase in the
number of subscribers will result in profitability or positive cash flow for the
Company in future years.
SUPPLIER AGREEMENT
Although the agreement with Philips to supply the Company satellite
transmission system provides a means by which the Company could obtain a second
and third supplier for all or part of its future requirements for D-DTH
Reception Systems, the Company does not have any sources for obtaining
conditional access systems compatible with the integrated receiver decoders
other than Philips and future licensees of Philips. The failure of Philips to
deliver D-DTH Reception Systems on schedule, or at all, would delay or interrupt
the commencement of the Company D-DTH business and thereby could have a
material adverse effect on the Company business, financial condition and
results of operations. Additionally, failure by Philips' retail network to
provide the desired levels of service, quality and expertise which are outside
the control of the Company could have a material adverse impact on the
Company operations and financial condition.

19. CONCENTRATIONS OF BUSINESS AND CREDIT RISK CONTINUED
ASTRA SATELLITES
The Company D-DTH business will depend on its ability to broadcast using
certain transponders. Satellites are subject to significant risks that may
prevent or impair proper commercial operations, including satellite defects,
destruction and damage. The Company has been designated a non-pre-emptible
customer under each of its relevant transponder leases. As a result, in the
event of satellite or transponder malfunction, the Company use of its
transponders cannot be suspended or terminated by a broadcaster which has
pre-emption rights permitting it to gain access to additional transponders in
preference to certain other Astra customers. The Company, however, is not a
protected customer under its satellite transponder leases and, in the event of
a failure of one or more of its transponders, would not be able to pre-empt any
other transponder customer. Due to the high cost of insurance policies relating
to satellite operations, the Company does not insure against possible
interruption of access to its transponders. The operation of the Astra
satellites is outside the control of the Company and a disruption of
transmissions on those satellites could have a material adverse effect on the
Company, depending upon the duration of the disruption. The ability of the
Company to transmit its programming following termination of the Company
leases of the transponders and following the expiration of the expected useful
lives of the Astra satellites in approximately 2015 will depend upon the
ability of the Company to extend its existing leases and/or to obtain rights to
utilize additional transponders on future Astra or other satellites.
USE OF TPSA CONDUITS
The Company ability to build out its existing cable television networks
and to integrate acquired systems into its cable television networks depends on,
among other things, the Company continued ability to design and obtain access
to network routes, and to secure other construction resources, all at reasonable
costs and on satisfactory terms and conditions. Many of such factors are beyond
the control of the Company. In addition, at December 31, 1997, approximately 60%
of the Company cable plant had been constructed utilizing pre-existing
conduits of TPSA. A substantial portion of the Company contracts with TPSA for
the use of such conduits permits termination by TPSA without penalty at any time
either immediately upon the occurrence of certain conditions or upon provision
of three to six months' notice without cause.
LIMITED INSURANCE COVERAGE
While the Company carries general liability insurance on its properties,
like many other operators of cable television systems it does not insure the
underground portion of its cable televisions networks. Accordingly, any
catastrophe affecting a significant portion of the Company cable television
networks could result in substantial uninsured losses and could have a material
adverse effect on the Company.
YEAR 2000
In January 1997, the Company developed a plan to deal with the Year 2000
problem to make its computer systems Year 2000 compliant. The plan provides for
the Year 2000 related efforts to be completed by the end of 1998. Largely as a
result of its high rate of growth over the past few years, the Company has
entered into an agreement to purchase a new system to replace its current
accounting computer system and an agreement to purchase specialized billing
software for the Company new customer service and billing center. The Company
has no other significant computer systems. The total

cost of the purchases is estimated to be approximately $2,400,000. The Company
has obtained confirmations from the vendors of the systems indicating that such
systems are Year 2000 compliant.
CREDIT WORTHINESS
All of the Company customers are located in Poland. As is typical in this
industry, no single customer accounted for more than five percent of the
Company sales in 1997 or 1996. The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful
accounts based on the credit worthiness of its customers as well as general
economic conditions. Consequently, an adverse change in those factors could
effect the Company estimate of its bad debts.
20. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
During the fourth quarter of 1997 circumstances came to the attention of
management which led to the determination that certain receivable balances from
minority interests were not recoverable. The Company has recorded an adjustment
to minority interest of approximately $5,800,000 relating to this write-off, of
which approximately $3,300,000 related to prior years.

appointed as directors, pursuant to the Bylaws, by the Board of Directors in
connection with the expansion of the Board of Directors from five to eight
members.
@ Entertainment Certificate of Incorporation the Certificate and
Bylaws provide that the directors shall be classified, with respect to the time
for which they severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in
number as possible. The first class of directors consists of two directors
Messrs. Swirski and A. Chase whose terms shall expire at the annual meeting of
stockholders to be held in the first year following the effective date of the
Initial Public Equity Offering Effective Date; the second class consists of
three directors Messrs. D. Chase and Lanphere and Ms. Holland whose terms
shall expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in the second year
following the Effective Date; and the third class consists of three directors
Messrs. Fowler, Chisholm and Chance, whose terms shall expire at the annual
meeting of stockholders to be held in the third year following the Effective
Date. Each class of directors will hold office until its respective successors
are duly elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of the stockholders, the
successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be
elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders
to be held in the third year following the year of their elections. Any decrease
in the authorized number of directors shall not be effective until the
expiration of the terms of the directors then in office, unless at the time of
such decrease there shall be vacancies on the Board of Directors which are being
eliminated by such decrease.
The Certificate and Bylaws provide that any director may resign at any time
by giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief
Executive Officer or the Board of Directors. If, at any other time than the
annual meeting of the stockholders, any vacancy occurs in @ Entertainment
Board of Directors caused by resignation, death, retirement, disqualification or
removal from office of any director or otherwise, or any new directorship is
created by an increase in the authorized number of directors, a majority of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum, may choose a successor,
or fill the newly created directorship, and the director so chosen shall hold
office until the next election for that class of directors by the stockholders
and until his successor shall be duly elected and qualified, unless sooner
displaced. The Certificate and Bylaws provide that any director may be removed
from office only with cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of
at least two-thirds of the voting power of all shares
96
entitled to vote, unless two-thirds of the Continuing Directors as defined in
the Certificate vote to recommend to the stockholders the removal of a director
with or without cause and such recommendation is approved by the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote.
The Bylaws provide that a majority of the total number of directors then in
office constitutes a quorum of the Board of Directors. The Bylaws further
provide that the act of a majority of all of the directors present at a meeting
for which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except
as otherwise provided by statute or in the Certificate. The Certificate provides
that the Board of Directors or stockholders shall have the power to amend the
Bylaws by majority vote, except for certain provisions of the Bylaws for which
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the continuing directors or of the holders
of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote is
required.
The Bylaws provide that regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be
held without notice immediately following the annual meeting of the stockholders
of @ Entertainment. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or any two directors.
The Board of Directors of @ Entertainment elected Messrs. Chisholm and
Chance the Business Independent Directors and Ms. Holland the Artistic
Independent Director to serve as three directors who are not affiliated with
or employed by the Company and who, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, do
not have a relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
The Board of Directors of @ Entertainment currently maintains an Audit
Committee and a Compensation Committee.
The Audit Committee is comprised of Messrs. Chisholm and Chance. The Audit
Committee function is to recommend to the Board of Directors the independent
public accountants to be employed by @ Entertainment, to confer with the
independent public accountants concerning the scope of their audit, to review
the accountants' findings and recommendations and to review the adequacy of @
Entertainment internal accounting controls. KPMG Polska Sp. z o.o. presently
serves as the independent public accountants of @ Entertainment. The Audit
Committee meets as necessary, but at least once a year. The Audit Committee was
formed in January 1998 and therefore did not meet in 1997.
The Compensation Committee is comprised of Messrs. Fowler, D. Chase,
Lanphere, Chisholm and Chance. The Compensation Committee function is to
approve, and in some instances to recommend to the Board of Directors of @
Entertainment, compensation arrangements involving the executive officers and
certain other employees of the Company. The Compensation Committee meets as
necessary. The composition of the Compensation Committee was not finalized until
December 31, 1997, and therefore did not meet in 1997.
REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS
Each non-employee director may receive such fees and other compensation,
along with reimbursement of expenses incurred on behalf of the Company or in
connection with attendance at meetings, as the Board of Directors may from time
to time determine. Each Business Independent Director receives $5,000 for
attendance at each of the five regular meetings of the Board of Directors, and
an additional $5,000 for attendance at any special meetings of the Board of
Directors. Each Artistic Independent Director receives $5,000 for attendance at
each of the five regular meetings of the Board of Directors.
