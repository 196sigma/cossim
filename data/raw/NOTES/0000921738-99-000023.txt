and Subsidiaries
Wyomissing, Pennsylvania
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Penn National
Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Penn National
Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Charles Town Races              --      159   206                  Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
and amortization of leasehold improvements
are computed by the straight-line method at
rates  adequate to allocate the cost of
applicable assets over their estimated useful
36                  lives. Depreciation and amortization for the
years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998
amounted to  $1,301,000,  $3,193,000  and
$4,705,000, respectively.
The excess of cost over fair value of net
assets acquired is being amortized on the
straight-line  method  over a  forty-year
period. Amortization expense for 1996, 1997
and 1998 amounted to $98,000, $578,000 and
$613,000, respectively. The Company evaluates
the recoverability of the goodwill quarterly,
or more  frequently  whenever events and
circumstances warrant revised estimates and
considers whether the goodwill should be
completely or partially written off or the
amortization period accelerated.
The Company reviews the carrying values of
its long-lived and identifiable intangible
assets for possible  impairment  whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicates
that the carrying amount of the assets may
not be recoverable based on undiscounted
estimated future operating cash flows. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company has determined
that no impairment has occurred.
Deferred  financing costs are charged to
operations over the life of the underlying
indebtedness.  Amortization  of  deferred
financing costs for 1996, 1997 and 1998
amounted to $34,000, $269,000 and $430,000,
respectively.
Income Taxes
The  Company  recognizes  deferred  tax
liabilities  and assets for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have
been recognized in the Company financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method,
deferred tax  liabilities and assets are
determined based on the difference between
the financial statement carrying amounts and
tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect in the years in
which the  differences  are  expected to
reverse.
Customer Deposits
Customer deposits represent amounts held by
the Company for telephone wagering.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all cash balances and
highly liquid  investments  with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per share  includes no
dilution and is calculated by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period.
Dilutive net income per share reflects the
potential dilution of securities that could
share in the net income of the Company which
consist of stock options and warrants using
the treasury stock method.
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs which are incurred
by the Company in connection with debt are
charged to operations over the life of the
underlying indebtedness using the interest
method, adjusted to give effect to any early
repayments.
37                  Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial  instruments  which  potentially
subject the Company to credit risk consist of
cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
The Company policy is to limit the amount
of credit exposure to any one financial
institution  and place  investments  with
financial institutions evaluated as being
creditworthy, or in short-term money market
and tax-free bond funds which are exposed to
minimal interest rate and credit risk. At
December 31, 1998, the Company had bank
deposits which exceeded federally insured
limits by approximately $3,298,000 and money
market  and  tax-free  bond  funds  of
approximately  $975,000.  Concentration of
credit  risk,  with  respect to accounts
receivable, is limited due to the Company
credit evaluation process. The Company does
not require collateral from its customers.
The Company receivables consist principally
of amounts due from other racetracks and
OTWs. Historically,  the Company has not
incurred  any  significant  credit-related
losses.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions are
used to estimate the fair value of each class
of financial instruments for which it is
practical to estimate.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: The 
carrying amount approximates the fair
value due to the short maturity of the
cash equivalents.
Long-Term  Debt and  Capital  Lease
Obligations: The fair value of the
Company long-term debt and capital
lease obligations is estimated based on
the quoted market prices for the same
or similar issues or on the current
rates offered to the Company for debt
of the same remaining maturities. The
carrying amount approximates fair value
since the Company  interest rates
approximate current interest rates.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles  requires  management  to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent  assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial
statements  and the reported  amounts of
revenue and expenses at the reporting period.
Actual  results  could differ from those
estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998,  the Financial  Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments SFAS 133. SFAS
133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of
the fiscal years beginning after June 15,
1999 and establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for
hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires that an
entity recognize all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities  and measure those
instruments at fair market value. Presently,
the  Company  does  not  use  derivative
instruments either in hedging activities or
as investments.  Accordingly, the Company
believes that adoption of SFAS 133 will have
no impact on its financial  position or
results of operations.
38
The Company has no comprehensive income
items as required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130,
Comprehensive Income.
2.   Acquisitions        Pocono Downs Acquisition
On November 27, 1996, the Company purchased
all of the capital stock of The Plains
Company and the limited partnership interests
in The Plains Company affiliated entities
together, Pocono Downs for an aggregate
purchase  price  of $482  million  plus
acquisition-related  fees and expenses of
$730,000. Pocono Downs conducts live harness
racing at the harness  racetrack located
outside Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, export
simulcasting  of Pocono  Downs  races to
locations  throughout  the United States,
pari-mutuel wagering at Pocono Downs and at
OTWs in Allentown,  Erie, Carbondale and
Hazleton, Pennsylvania on Pocono Downs races
and on import simulcast races from other
racetracks, and telephone account wagering on
live and import simulcast races.
The Pocono Downs acquisition was accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, a portion of the purchase price
was allocated to the net assets acquired
based on their estimated fair values. The
balance of the purchase price was recorded at
cost over net assets acquired as goodwill,
approximately $104 million, and is being
amortized over forty years on a straight-line
basis. The Company recorded an additional
increase to goodwill of approximately $97
million and a corresponding increase to a
deferred tax liability,  representing the
difference between the financial and tax
bases of certain assets acquired. The results
of operations of Pocono Downs have been
included  in the  Company  consolidated
financial statements since the effective date
of the acquisition. The Company used its
credit facility see Note 3 and cash of
Pocono  Downs to fund  the  acquisition.
Pursuant to the terms of the Pocono Downs
purchase agreement,  the Company will be
required to pay the sellers of Pocono Downs
an additional $10 million if, within five
years after the consummation of the Pocono
Downs acquisition, Pennsylvania authorizes
any additional form of gaming in which the
Company may participate. The $10 million
payment  would  be  payable  in  annual
installments of $2 million for five years,
beginning on the date that the Company first
offers such additional form of gaming.
Charles Town Acquisition
On February 26, 1996, the Company entered
into a joint venture agreement the Charles
Town Joint Venture with Bryant Development
Company and its affiliates Bryant, the
holder of an option to purchase substantially
all of the assets of Charles Town Racing
Limited Partnership and Charles Town Races,
Inc. together, Charles Town relating to
the Charles Town Race Track and Shenandoah
Downs  together,  the  Charles  Town
Entertainment Complex in Jefferson County,
West Virginia. In connection with the Charles
Town Joint Venture agreement, Bryant assigned
the option to the Charles Town Joint Venture.
In November 1996, the Charles Town Joint
Venture and Charles Town entered into an
amended and restated option agreement. On
November 5, 1996, Jefferson County, West
Virginia approved a referendum permitting
installation  of gaming  machines at the
Charles Town  Entertainment  Complex.  On
January 15, 1997, the Charles Town Joint
Venture acquired substantially all of the
assets of Charles Town for approximately
$160 million plus acquisition-related fees
and expenses of approximately $22 million.
Pursuant to the original operating agreement
governing the Charles Town Joint Venture, the
39
Company held an 80% ownership interest in the
Charles Town Joint Venture and was obligated
to contribute 80% of the purchase price of
the Charles Town acquisition and 80% of the
cost of  refurbishing  the Charles  Town
Entertainment Complex. In consideration of
the fact that the Company contributed 100% of
the purchase  price of the Charles Town
acquisition  and  100%  of the  cost of
refurbishing the Charles Town Entertainment
Complex, the Company amended its operating
agreement with Bryant to, among other things,
increase the Company ownership interest in
the Charles Town Joint Venture to 89% and
decrease  Bryant  interest  to 11%. In
addition, the amendment provided that the
entire amount the Company has contributed to
the Charles Town Joint  Venture for the
acquisition and refurbishment of the Charles
Town Entertainment Complex would be treated,
as between the parties, as a loan to the
Charles Town Joint Venture from the Company.
Accordingly, prior to the distribution of any
future profits pursuant to the Charles Town
Joint Venture, the Company must be repaid in
full all such contributions or loans, plus
accrued interest, which as of December 31,
1998 amounted to $520 million.
Bryant had acquired its option from Showboat
Operating Company Showboat. Showboat has
retained an option the Showboat Option to
operate any casino at the Charles  Town
Entertainment  Complex  in return  for a
management fee to be negotiated at the time,
based  on  rates  payable  for  similar
properties and a right of first refusal to
purchase or lease the site of any casino at
the Charles  Town  Entertainment  Complex
proposed to be leased or sold and to purchase
any interest proposed to be sold in any such
casino on the same terms offered by a third
party or otherwise  negotiated  with the
Charles Town Joint  Venture.  The rights
retained by Showboat  under the Showboat
Option extend for a period of five years from
November 6, 1996, the date that the Charles
Town Joint Venture exercised its option to
purchase the Charles Town Races, and expires
thereafter  unless  legislation to permit
casino  gaming  at  the  Charles  Town
Entertainment Complex has been adopted prior
to the end of the five-year period. If such
legislation has been adopted prior to such
time, then the rights of Showboat continue
for a reasonable time not less than 24
months to permit completion of negotiations.
While the express terms of the Showboat
Option do not specify which activities at the
Charles Town Entertainment  Complex would
constitute operation of a casino, Showboat
has  agreed  that the  installation  and
operation of gaming devices linked to the
lottery like the gaming machines the Company
has installed and will continue to install
at the Charles Town Entertainment Complex
racetrack would not trigger Showboat right
to exercise the Showboat Option.
The Charles Town Joint Venture refurbished
and reopened the Charles Town Entertainment
Complex as an entertainment complex that
features live racing,  dining,  simulcast
wagering and, effective September 1997, the
operation of gaming machines. The cost of the
refurbishment was approximately $278 million
inclusive of $614,000 of capitalized interest
and exclusive of the costs of the gaming
machines.
The Charles Town acquisition was accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, a portion of the purchase price
was allocated to the net assets acquired
based on their estimated fair values. The
balance of the purchase price was recorded as
cost over net assets acquired as goodwill,
approximately $17 million, and is being
40                  amortized over forty years on a straight-line
basis. The Company used its credit facility
see Note 3 and cash from operations to fund
the acquisition.
The results of operations of Charles Town
have  been  included  in  the  Company
consolidated  financial  statements  since
January 15, 1997, the effective date of the
acquisition. 3. Long-Term Debt     Long-term debt and capital lease obligations are as

Credit Facilities
At December 31,  1998,  the Company was
contingently  obligated  under letters of
credit  with  face  amounts  aggregating
$1,886,000.  These  amounts  consisted of
$1,786,000 relating to the horsemens' account
balances and  $100,000  for  Pennsylvania
pari-mutuel taxes.
In November 1996, the Company entered into an
agreement with a bank group which provides an
aggregate  of  $75  million  of  credit
facilities,  which included a $5 million
revolving  credit  facility  the Credit
Facility. Simultaneously with the closing
of the Credit Facility, the Company repaid
amounts outstanding under its old credit
facility and replaced it. The Credit Facility
consisted of two term loan facilities of $47
million and $23 million together, the Term
Loans which were used for the Pocono Downs
and Charles Town acquisitions, respectively,
and which were used for a portion of the cost
of  refurbishment  of the  Charles  Town
Entertainment Complex, and a revolving credit
facility  of $5 million  together,  the
Loans. The Term Loans were repaid in
December  1997 with the proceeds of the
Company debt offering. See Debt Offering
hereinafter.  At such  time,  the Credit
Facility was amended and restated to provide
for a $12 million revolving credit facility,
41
including a $3 million sublimit for standby
letters of credit, which matures in December
2002.
On January 28, 1999, the Company entered into
a second amendment and restatement of the
Credit Facility. The Credit Facility, as
amended, provides for a $20 million revolving
credit facility,  including a $3 million
sublimit for standby letters of credit and a
$5 million term loan. Under the terms of the
Credit Facility, as amended, the Company
borrowed an additional $115 million, of
which $112 million of the proceeds was used
to finance its share of the New Jersey Joint
Venture see Note 4. The revolving credit
facility is secured by substantially all of
the assets of the Company, except for the
assets of the Charles Town facility. The
revolving  credit  facility  provides for
certain covenants,  including those of a
financial nature.
At the Company  option,  the revolving
facility may bear interest at the highest of:
1 1/2 of 1% in excess of the federal
reserve reported certificate of deposit rate,
2 the rate that the bank group announces
from time to time as its prime lending rate
and 3 1/2 of 1% in excess of the federal
funds rate plus an applicable margin of up to
2% or the revolving facility may also bear
interest at a rate tied to a eurodollar rate
plus an applicable margin of up to 3%. The
outstanding amount under this credit facility
as of December 31, 1998 was $90 million at
an interest rate of 78125%.
Mandatory  repayments  of  the  revolving
facility are required in an amount equal to a
percentage of the net cash proceeds from any
issuance or incurrence of equity or funded
debt by the Company, that percentage to be
dependent upon the then outstanding balance
of the revolving facility and the Company
leverage ratio.  Mandatory  repayments of
varying percentages are also required in the
event of either asset sales in excess of
stipulated amounts or defined excess cash
flow.
Debt Offering
On December 12, 1997, the Company and certain
of its subsidiaries as guarantors entered
into a purchase agreement for the sale and
issuance of $80,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of its 10625% Senior Notes due 2004
the Offering. The net proceeds of the
Offering were used for repayment of existing
indebtedness, for capital expenditures and
for general corporate purposes. Interest on
the notes will accrue from their date of
original issuance the Issue Date and will
be payable semi-annually, commencing in 1998.
The notes will be redeemable, in whole or in
part, at the option of the Company in 2001 or
thereafter at the redemption prices set forth
in the Offering, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of redemption.
The notes are general  unsecured  senior
obligations of the Company and rank equally
in right of payment to any existing and
future unsubordinated indebtedness of the
Company and senior in right of payment with
all  existing  and  future  subordinated
indebtedness of the Company. The notes are
unconditionally guaranteed the Guarantees
on a senior basis by certain of the Company
existing  subsidiaries  the  Subsidiary
Guarantors.  The Guarantees are general
unsecured  obligations  of the Subsidiary
Guarantors and rank equally in right of
payment to any unsubordinated indebtedness of
42
the Subsidiary Guarantors and rank senior in
right of payment to all other subordinated
obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors. The
notes are effectively subordinated in right
of payment to all secured indebtedness of the
Company,  including  indebtedness incurred
under the amended $20 million  revolving
credit facility.
On September 3, 1998, the Company repurchased
$11 million of the 10625% Senior Notes due
2004 at 9725% of the principal  amount
$10,697,500  plus  accrued  interest of
$253,229 in public  market  trading.  In
conjunction with the repurchase of the notes,
the Company recorded a write-off of deferred
financing costs associated with this portion
of the long-term debt. The extinguishment of
these notes did not result in any material
net loss.
The following is a schedule of future minimum
lease payments under capitalized leases and
repayments of long-term debt as of December

4.   Commitments        Operating Agreements
and
Contingencies       In November 1997, the Company signed a new
Totalisator services and equipment agreement
for all of its subsidiaries. The agreement is
for five years, expiring on March 31, 2003.
The new  agreement  provides  for annual
payments based on a specified percentage of
the total amount wagered at the Company
facilities with a minimum annual payment of
$1,475,000.
The Company is also liable under numerous
operating leases for  automobiles,  other
equipment and buildings, which expire through
2004.  Total rental  expense under these
agreements was  $1,001,000,  $807,000 and
$1,169,000 for the years ended December 31,
1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.

In June 1997, the Charles Town Joint Venture,
which is operated as PNGI  Charles Town
Gaming,  LLC, an 89%  subsidiary of the
Company,  entered into an agreement the
GTECH Agreement with GTECH relating to the
lease, installation and service of a video
lottery system VLS at the Charles Town
Entertainment Complex. The GTECH Agreement
included a minimum annual fee of $43 million
if more than 799 gaming machines were placed
in operation. Due to significant economic
benefits to the Company, on November 18, 1998
the Company entered into an agreement to
purchase GTECH assets and rights related to
the provision of gaming technology at Charles
Town Races. Under the terms of the agreement,
the Company  assumed the  ownership  and
operation of the 799 gaming machines and the
central monitoring system for consideration
of $129 million.
Employment and Consulting Agreements
The Company has employment agreements with
its Chairman and Chief Financial Officer at
annual base salaries of $225,000 and $95,000,
respectively. The agreements became effective
June 1, 1994 and, as amended, terminate on
June 30, 1999. Each agreement prohibits the
employee from competing with the Company
during its term and for one year thereafter,
and requires a death benefit payment by the
Company equal to 50% of the employee annual
salary in effect at the time of death.
The Company signed a consulting agreement
with its former Chairman expiring in August
1999 at an annual payment of $125,000. On
July 1, 1998, the consulting agreement was
amended to increase the annual payment to
$135,000.
The Company has an employment agreement with
its President and Chief Operating Officer at
an annual base salary of $210,000.  The
agreement was to terminate on June 12, 1998,
but has been extended until June 12, 1999.
The agreement prohibits the employee from
competing with the Company during its term
and for two years thereafter, and requires a
death benefit payment by the Company equal to
50% of the employee annual salary in effect
at the time of his death.
The Company has two profit sharing plans
under the provisions of Section 401k of the
Internal Revenue Code, The Penn National
Gaming, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan the Penn
National 401k Plan and the Pocono Downs,
Inc. Profit Sharing Plan the Pocono Downs
401k  Plan,  that cover all eligible
employees who are not members of a bargaining
unit. Both plans enable employees choosing to
participate to defer a portion of their
salary  in  a  retirement  fund  to  be
administered by the Company. The Company
44
contributions to the Penn National 401k
Plan are set at 50% of employees elective
salary deferrals which may be made up to a
maximum of 6% of employee compensation. The
Company has no obligation to contribute to
the Pocono Downs 401k plan. However, for
the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997, and
1998, the Company has made discretionary
contributions to the Pocono Downs 401k Plan
based upon a percentage of the employee
elective deferrals which may be made up to a
maximum of 15% of employee compensation. The
Company made contributions to these plans of
approximately $89,000, $145,000 and $172,000
for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997,
and 1998, respectively. Charles Town has a
defined   contribution   plan  covering
substantially all of its employees. Charles
Town makes monthly contributions equal to the
amount accrued for retirement expense, which
is calculated as 25% of the daily mutual
handle and 5% of the net video lottery
revenues. Total contributions for the years
ended  December  31, 1997 and 1998 were
$114,000 and $185,000, respectively.
On December 31, 1998, the Company merged the
Pocono Downs, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan into
the Penn National Gaming, Inc. 401k Plan
and  spun  off  the  assets  into  the
non-bargaining unit employees in the Charles
Town Races Future Services Retirement Plan
and merged  those  assets into the Penn
National 401k Plan. The results of the
merger is that the Company operates the Penn
National 401k Plan for all non-bargaining
unit employees at all locations while the
Charles Town Races Future Services Retirement
Plan is for bargaining unit employees at the
Charles Town facility.
OTW and Operating Facilities
On July 7, 1998, the Company entered into an
agreement with Ladbroke to purchase their
Johnstown, Pennsylvania OTW facility. The
agreement provided for a purchase price of
$1,225,000 for the assignment of the facility
lease and the sale of assets and was subject
to numerous contingencies, including approval
by the  Pennsylvania  State Horse Racing
Commission.  Approval  for the  sale and
transfer of the Johnstown OTW was received
from the Harness Racing Commission on August
14, 1998 and the Pennsylvania State Horse
Racing Commission on August 20, 1998. Under
the terms of the agreements, the Company
sub-leased the facility from Ladbroke and
operated the facility from September 1, 1998,
the effective date of the agreement, through
December 30, 1998, the closing date of the
agreement, for $12,500 per month, at which
time the Company assumed full rights and
ownership of the facility.
On July 14, 1998, the Company entered into a
lease agreement for an OTW facility in East
Stroudsburg. The lease is for approximately
14,000  square feet at the Eagle Glen
Shopping Plaza located in East Stroudsburg,
Pennsylvania. The initial term of the lease
is for ten  years  with two  additional
five-year renewal options available.  The
agreement   is  subject  to  numerous
contingencies,  including approval by the
Harness Racing Commission. On November 6,
1998, the Company submitted its application
for such approval. If approved by the Harness
Racing Commission, the Company expects to
spend approximately $2 million to have the
facility constructed and operational by the
end of 1999.
The  Company  is  subject  to  possible
liabilities  arising  from  environmental
conditions at the landfill adjacent to Pocono
Downs Racetrack. Specifically, the Company
may incur expenses in connection with the
landfill in the future, which expenses may
not be reimbursed by the four municipalities
45
which are parties to an existing settlement
agreement. The Company is unable to estimate
the amount, if any, that it may be required
to expend.
Potential Tennessee Development Project
In June 1997, the Company acquired twelve
one-month options to purchase approximately
100 acres of land in Memphis, Tennessee.
Since such time, the Company, through its
subsidiary, Tennessee Downs, Inc. Tennessee
Downs, has pursued the development of a
harness track and simulcast facility, which 
is located in the northeastern section of 
Memphis  the Tennessee Development
Project. The Company
submitted an application to the Tennessee
State Racing  Commission  the Tennessee
Commission in October 1997 for an initial
license for the development and operation of
a harness track and OTW facility at this
site. A land use plan for the construction of
a 5/8-mile harness track,  clubhouse and
grandstand area was approved in October 1997
by the Land Use Hearing Board for the City of
Memphis and County of Shelby. Tennessee Downs
was determined to be financially suitable by
the Tennessee Commission and a public comment
hearing before the Tennessee Commission was
held in November 1997. In December 1997, the
Company received the necessary zoning and
land development approvals from the Memphis
City Council. In April 1998, the Tennessee
Commission granted a license to the Company,
which would expire on the earlier of: i
December 31, 2000 or ii the expiration of
Tennessee Commission term on June 30, 1998,
if such term was not  extended  by the
Tennessee Commission. On May 1, 1998, the
Tennessee State Legislature voted against
extending  the  life  of  the  Tennessee
Commission,   allowing  the   Tennessee
Commission term to expire on June 30, 1998.
The Tennessee Commission held a meeting on
May 29, 1998 at which it rejected  the
Company request: i to grant the Company
an extended timeframe  for the effectiveness
of its racing license; ii for racing days
for the period ending December 31, 2000; and
iii to operate a  temporary  simulcast
facility. On July 28, 1998, the Company filed
for  a  preliminary  injunction  and  a
declaratory ruling on the legal status of
racing in Memphis. On November 23, 1998, the
court ruled that the Racing Control Act had
not been repealed and cannot be repealed by
implication  by dissolving  the Tennessee
Commission. It is the opinion of the court
that because the Racing Control Act is still
in force,  horse-racing  and  pari-mutuel
betting is a legal unregulated activity in
Tennessee. This opinion has been appealed by
the Tennessee Attorney General. The Company
intends to continue its efforts to develop
and operate a harness track in Tennessee.
Costs  incurred as of December 31, 1998
regarding the Tennessee license amounted to
$489,000  and are  presented  in prepaid
expenses and other current assets.                  New Jersey Joint Venture

joint venture Joint Venture, the Company,
along  with its Joint  Venture  partner,
Greenwood, agreed to purchase certain assets
of the Garden State Race Track and Freehold
Raceway, both located in New Jersey the
Acquisition.   46
The purchase price for the Acquisition is
approximately  $46  million  subject  to
reduction of up to approximately $1 million
based upon the resolution of certain disputed
items, for which amounts have been placed in
escrow. The purchase price will consist of
$23 million in cash and $23 million pursuant
to two deferred purchase price promissory
notes in the amount of $22 million and $1
million each. The Company is responsible for
50% of the purchase price. The parties to the
Joint Venture are also contingently liable to
the sellers in amounts not to exceed a total
of $10 million, if the Joint Venture receives
various approvals for off-track wagering or
phone betting.
The Joint Venture is contingent upon, among
other things, the Company obtaining approvals
necessary to effect the Joint Venture, which
approvals include: i full and complete New
Jersey regulatory approval including but not
limited to approval of the New Jersey Racing
Commission;  ii  Hart  Scott  Rodino
compliance; and iii the written consent of
a majority of the holders of its $80 million
Senior Notes issued December 17, 1997 to any
necessary modification to the Indenture dated
December 12, 1997 to permit the Company
investment in the Joint Venture. At the
initial closing of the Acquisition on January
28, 1999, the Company loaned FR Park Racing,
LP, a New  Jersey  limited  partnership,
$11,250,000  at  the  Company effective
borrowing rate as specified in Note 3 under
Credit Facilities, which is secured by
certain assets. After obtaining the above
approvals,  the  Company  will invest an
additional $11,750,000 into the Joint Venture

48   7. Common 
Stock On February 18, 1997, the Company 
completed a secondary public offering of
1,725,000 shares of its common stock. 
The net proceeds of $23 million were used to
reduce $19 million of the Term Loan amounts
outstanding under the Credit Facility with 
the balance of the proceeds used to finance
a portion of the cost of the refurbishment
of the Charles Town Entertainment
Complex see Note 2 for Acquisitions.
From August 21, 1998 to September 10, 1998,
the Company purchased 424,700 shares of its
common stock in public market trading. The
total  cost of  these  transactions  was
$2,378,465 or $560 per share average price.
In April 1994,  the Company  Board of
Directors  and  shareholders  adopted and
approved the Stock Option Plan the Plan.
On April 30, 1997, the shareholders and the
Board of Directors approved an increase in
the number of authorized shares underlying
stock options to be granted from 1,290,000 to
2,000,000 shares. Therefore, the Plan permits
the grant of options to purchase up to
2,000,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to
antidilution adjustments, at a price per
share no less than 100% of the fair market
value of the Common Stock on the date an
option is granted with respect to incentive
stock options only. The price would be no
less than 110% of fair market value in the
case of an incentive stock option granted to
any individual who owns more than 10% of the
total combined voting power of all classes of
outstanding stock. The Plan provides for the
granting of both incentive stock options
intended to qualify under Section 422 of the
Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986,  and
nonqualified stock options which do not so
qualify.  Unless the Plan is  terminated
earlier by the Board of Directors, the Plan
will terminate in April 2004.
Stock options that expire between August 20,
2000 and August 6, 2008 have been granted to
officers and directors to purchase Common
Stock at prices ranging from $333 to $1763

During  1995,  the  Financial  Accounting
Standards  Board  adopted  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation
SFAS  123,  which  has  recognition
provisions that establish a fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation plans and established fair value
as the measurement basis for transactions in
which an entity acquires goods or services
from nonemployees in exchange for equity
instruments.  SFAS 123 also has  certain
disclosure  provisions.  Adoption  of the
recognition  provisions of SFAS 123 with
regard  to  these  transactions  with
nonemployees  was  required for all such
transactions entered into after December 15,
1994,  and  the  Company  adopted  these
provisions as required.  The  recognition
provision with regard to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation plans is optional. Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employers APB 25,
uses what is referred to as an intrinsic
value based method of accounting. The Company
has decided to continue to apply APB 25 for
its  stock-based  employee  compensation
arrangements. Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized. Had compensation
cost for the Company employee stock option
plan been determined based on the fair value
at the grant date for awards under the plan
consistent with the method of SFAS 123, the
Company net income and net income per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below:
