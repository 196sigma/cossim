TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION
Targeted Genetics Corporation the Company is developing gene therapy
products for the treatment of certain acquired and inherited diseases. As a
development stage company, the Company has devoted substantially all its efforts
to date to conducting research and development activities, recruiting personnel
and raising capital.
The Company was incorporated in the state of Washington in March 1989 as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Immunex Corporation Immunex. In February 1992,
the Company issued 1,920,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to
Immunex in exchange for the grant of a license to certain technology, settlement
of advances from Immunex and cancellation of 40,000 shares of common stock
issued by the Company to Immunex on March 28, 1989. At December 31, 1996,
Immunex held 13% of the outstanding stock of the Company.
The Company estimates that, at its current rate of expenditures, its
existing cash, cash equivalents and securities available for sale will be
sufficient to meet operating requirements at least through the end of 1997.
Accordingly, the Company is pursuing collaborative arrangements with corporate
partners, with the intent of generating both research and development funding
and equity capital. The Company may also elect to seek additional equity capital
via the public or private markets, depending on market conditions.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with a purchased maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents, valued at cost
which approximates market, consist principally of money market accounts and
short-term government obligations.
Securities Available for Sale
Securities available for sale consist primarily of corporate debt
securities and U.S. Government notes, all of which mature within two years.
Management currently classifies the Company entire investment portfolio, other
than cash equivalents, as securities available for sale. Such securities are
stated at market value, with the unrealized gains and losses included as a
component of shareholders' equity. The cost of debt securities in this category
is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity,
which are included in investment income. Realized gains and losses and declines
in value judged to be other than temporary on securities available for sale are
also included in investment income. The cost of securities sold is calculated
using the specific identification method.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture
and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the assets'
estimated useful lives, ranging from three to seven years. Furniture and
equipment under capitalized leases are amortized over the life of the lease.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the improvements or the
term of the lease, whichever is shorter.

TARGETED GENETICS CORPORATION
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Stock Compensation
In adopting the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company has
elected to apply the disclosure-only provisions and related interpretations for
accounting for its stock option plans. The Company does not recognize any
compensation expense related to the plans since all options are granted at fair
market value on the date of grant.
Revenue Under Collaborative Agreements
Revenue under collaborative agreements is recognized as defined under the
terms of the respective collaborative agreements. Revenue related to milestones
is recognized upon the achievement of the related milestone and when collection
is probable. Royalty payments and other similar payments due as a direct result
of such revenues being earned and received are offset against and recognized in
the same period as such revenue.
Net Loss Per Share
Net loss per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares are not
included in the computation because the effect of their inclusion would be
antidilutive, except that, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
requirements, common equivalent shares issued during the twelve months prior to
the Company initial public offering have been included in the calculation as
if they were outstanding through March 31, 1994.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Reclassification
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements
to conform to the current year presentation.

9. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company sponsors an Employee Retirement Plan in accordance with Section
401k of the Internal Revenue Code. All employees 21 years old or older are
eligible to participate in the plan. Contributions made into the plan are at the
discretion of the Company Board of Directors. The Company incurred $81,364 of
expense in 1996 related to contributions to the plan. There were no
contributions to the plan made by the Company in 1995 or 1994.
10. INCOME TAXES
At December 31, 1996, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
$39,270,000 and research and experimental credit carryforwards of $1,074,000.
The carryforwards are available to offset future federal income taxes and begin
to expire in 2007. At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company provided a
valuation allowance to offset the excess of deferred tax assets over the
deferred tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the
net deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance increased by $5,717,000 and
$3,350,000 during 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss  $13,352,000   $8,223,000

Total deferred tax  $14,967,000   $9,250,000
Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. $14,967,000   $9,250,000
Utilization of federal income tax carry forwards is subject to certain
limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The
Company past sales of common stock have resulted in ownership changes as
defined under Section 382, resulting in limitations on the future use of carry
forwards. At December 31, 1996, the Company calculated its annual limitation to
be approximately $3,782,000. However, this annual limitation is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company utilization of its net operating
loss and research credit carryforwards.
