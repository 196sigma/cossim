Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met.Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework.Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework,management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2015. Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form10-K and, as part of its audit, has issued an attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of the our internal control over financial reporting.February25, 2016/S/ JOHNL.

MaddenChairman and Chief Executive OfficerExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer50Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and ShareholdersCepheidWe have audited Cepheids internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework the COSO criteria. Cepheids management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Cepheid maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Cepheid as of December31, 2015and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015of Cepheid and our report dated February25, 2016expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ ErnstYoung LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaFebruary25, 201651Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and ShareholdersCepheidWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cepheid as of December31, 2015and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Part IV b. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of Cepheids management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cepheid at December31, 2015and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations, comprehensive loss and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Cepheids internal control over financial reporting as of

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesOrganization and BusinessCepheid the Company was incorporated in the State of California on March4, 1996. The Company is a molecular diagnostics company that develops, manufactures, and markets fully-integrated systems for diagnostic testing in the Clinical market, as well as for application in the Companys legacy Non-Clinical market. The Companys systems enable fast, sophisticated molecular testing for organisms and genetic-based diseases by automating otherwise complex manual laboratory procedures.Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.Functional CurrencyThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency of all of the Companys subsidiaries. The Company remeasures its foreign subsidiaries monetary assets and liabilities to the U.S. dollar and records the net gains or losses resulting from remeasurement in Foreign currency exchange loss and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Company defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Companys valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximized the use of observable inputs and minimized the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on the following three levels of inputs:Level 1Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.See Note 2, Fair Value, for information and related disclosures regarding the Companys fair value measurements.Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and Non-Current InvestmentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and money market instruments. The Companys marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as cash equivalents, short-term investments or non-current investments based on each instruments underlying effective maturity date. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Marketable debt securities with effective maturities of 12 monthsor less are classified as short-term, and marketable debt securities with effective maturities greater than 12 monthsare classified as non-current. The Companys marketable debt securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported within accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. Interest and other income, net includes interest, dividends, amortization of purchase premiums and discounts and realized gains and losses on sales of securities58Table of ContentsThe Company assesses whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on its investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. With respect to the Companys debt securities, this assessment takes into account the severity and duration of the decline in value, the Companys intent to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether or not the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security that is, a credit loss exists.See Note 3, Investments, for information and related disclosures regarding the Companys investments.Restricted CashAt December31, 2015, prepaid expense and other current assets included $27 millionof restricted cash and other non-current assets included $21 millionof restricted cash, both held as security for bank guarantees provided to a foreign customer contract. The Company is required to maintain such guarantees until its contractual obligations are satisfied under the contract. At December 31, 2014, restricted cash of $19 millionwas included in prepaid expense and other current assets and consisted of cash contractually restricted for use to develop the Xpert Ebola test in accordance with our agreement with BMGF.Supplemental cash flow informationYears Ended December31,201520142013In thousandsSupplemental Cash Flow InformationCash paid for interest$4,383$2,145$109Cash paid for taxes$2,086$572$632Property, equipment and intangible assets acquired but not yet paid at end of  of Credit Risks and Other UncertaintiesThe carrying amounts for financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Derivative instruments and investments are stated at their estimated fair values, based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. The counterparties to the agreements relating to the Companys derivative instruments consist of large financial institutions of high credit standing.The Companys main financial institution for banking operations held 66%and 58%of the Companys cash and cash equivalents as of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.The Companys accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers and distributors. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers financial condition. The Company provides reserves for potential credit losses but has not experienced significant losses to date. There was onedirect customer whose accounts receivable balance represented 11%and 26%of total accounts receivable as of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.The Company currently sells products through its direct sales force and distributors. There were no direct customers that accounted for 10%or more of total sales for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013. No single country outside of the United States represented more than 10%of the Companys total revenue or total assets in any period presented.Inventory, NetInventory is stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost or market value, with cost determined on the first-in-first-out method. The allocation of production overhead to inventory costs is based on normal production capacity. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage are expensed as incurred, and not included in overhead. The Company maintains provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on managements estimates of forecasted demand and, where applicable, product expiration59Table of ContentsThe components of inventories were as follows in  Materials$39,267$36,287Work in Process62,15351,691Finished  addition, capitalized stock-based compensation expense of $25 millionand $16 millionwere included in inventory as of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term. There were noindications of impairment of property and equipment for the years ended December31, 2015and 2014. Property and equipment consisted of the following in    and software33,29124,402Office furniture11,9939,929Leasehold  accumulated depreciation and  depreciation and amortization expense on our property and equipment in the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013totaled $273 million, $216 millionand $178 million, respectively.Capitalized Software Costs for Internal UseInternally developed software primarily includes enterprise-level business software that the Company customizes to meet its specific operational needs. The Company capitalized costs for a new enterprise resource planning software system and other internal use software of $61 millionand $103 millionduring the years ended December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. Upon being placed in service, these assets are amortized over an estimated useful life of 3to 5 years.Intangible Assets and GoodwillIntangible assets related to licenses are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets related to technology and other intangible assets acquired in acquisitions are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from threeto 15 years. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily included in cost of sales, research and development and sales and marketing in the Consolidated Statements of Operations60Table of ContentsThe Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment and conducts the impairment review when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may be impaired by first estimating the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the intangible asset to assess whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds the Companys estimate of future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment value is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the intangible asset over the Companys estimate of its fair market value. Events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, significant changes in the Companys use of acquired assets, the Companys overall business strategy, or significant negative industry or economic trends. The Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges in 2015 or 2014. In 2013, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $13 millionto cost of sales primarily related to acquired technology for one of its legacy products.Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or as circumstances indicate their value may no longer be recoverable. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. The Company continues to operate in onesegment, which is also considered to be our sole reporting unit and therefore, goodwill was tested for impairment at the enterprise level. As of December31, 2015, there has been noimpairment of goodwill. The Company does not have intangible assets with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill.Warranty ReserveThe Company generally warrants its systems to be free from defects for a period of 12to 24 monthsfrom the date of sale and for our disposable products to be free from defects, when handled according to product specifications, for the stated life of such products. Accordingly, a provision for the estimated cost of warranty repair or replacement is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. The Companys warranty provision is established using managements estimate of future failure rates and the estimated cost of repair or replacement. The activities in the warranty provision consisted of the following in  at beginning of  at end of year$1,806$3,784$3,326Accrued and other liabilitiesAccrued and other liabilities consisted of the following in  expense for estimated legal  liabilities1,2983,812Accrued warranty reserve1,8063,784Accrued payment related to asset acquisition3,000Income tax  and other  of ContentsOther liabilitiesOther liabilities consisted of the following in  tax liabilities $1,152$6,261Deferred rent8,1657,721Non-current income tax  liabilities$15,779$18,768The Company early adopted ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis, which resulted in the reclassification of approximately $54 millionfrom current deferred tax assets to non-current deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2015.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue from sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. No right of return exists for the Companys products except in the case of damaged goods. The Company has not experienced any significant returns of its products. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales. In those cases where the Company bills shipping and handling costs to customers, the amounts billed are classified as revenue.The Company enters into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of its products and services. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements. The Company sells service contracts for which revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period.The Company may place an instrument at a customer site under a reagent rental agreement reagent rental. Under a reagent rental, the Company retains title to the instrument and earns revenue for the usage of the instrument and related maintenance services through the amount charged for reagents and other disposables. Under a reagent rental agreement, a customer may commit to purchasing minimum quantities of reagents at stated prices over a defined contract term, which is typically between three and five years. Revenue is recognized over the term of a reagent rental as reagents and other disposables are shipped and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. For multiple element arrangements, the total consideration for an arrangement is allocated among the separate elements in the arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price hierarchy for a deliverable is based on: 1vendor specific objective evidence VSOE, if available; 2third party evidence of selling price if VSOE is not available; or 3an estimated selling price, if neither VSOE nor third party evidence is available. Estimated selling price is our best estimate of the selling price of an element in a transaction. The Company limits the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or other future performance obligations. Revenue includes fees for research and development services earned under grants and collaboration agreements, which are recognized on a contract-specific basis. Revenue and profit under cost-plus service contracts is recognized as costs are incurred plus negotiated fees. For certain contracts, the Company utilizes the proportional performance method of revenue recognition which requires that the Company estimates the total amount of costs to be expended for a project and recognize revenue equal to the portion of costs incurred to date. The Company exercises judgment when estimating the level of effort required to complete a project. The estimated total costs to complete a project are subject to revision from time-to-time.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred for company-sponsored and collaborative research and development activities. These costs include direct and research-related overhead expenses, amortization of certain intangible assets, and the costs of clinical studies. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes the fair value of the Companys stock option awards as compensation expense over the requisite service period of each award, which is generally four years62Table of ContentsForeign Currency HedgingDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued and other liabilities.For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and is recognized into earnings within the same financial statement line item as the hedged item in the period during which the hedged transaction is realized. Gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges, if any, are recognized in current earnings. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income or loss for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common equivalent shares from dilutive stock options, employee stock purchases, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and shares issuable upon a potential conversion of the convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method. In loss periods, the earnings per share calculation excludes common equivalents shares because their inclusion would be antidilutive. Common stock equivalent shares totaled 8,952,000, 9,392,000and 5,267,000for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.The following summarizes the computation of basic and diluted loss per share in thousands, except for per share amounts:Years ended   weighted shares  loss per   weighted shares  of dilutive securities:Stock options, ESPP, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and convertible senior notesDiluted weighted shares  loss per  TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected as taxable income. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. Therefore, the Company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that the Company does not believe it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets.SegmentsThe Company operates in one segment. Management uses one measurement of profitability and does not segregate its business for internal reporting63Table of ContentsLegal ContingenciesThe Company is involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to intellectual property, employment, and other contractual matters. The Company regularly assesses the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters. If the Company determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, it records a liability in the financial statements. If a reasonable estimate of a probable loss cannot be made, but the Company is able to estimate the potential range of probable loss, the Company records a liability based on the low-end of the estimated range of loss. If a loss is not probable but is reasonably possible and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred.Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable results could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Each matter presents its own unique circumstances, and prior litigation does not necessarily provide a reliable basis on which to predict the outcome, or range of outcomes, in any individual proceeding. Consequently, in the event that opposing litigants in outstanding litigations or claims ultimately succeed at trial and any subsequent appeals on their claims, any potential loss or charges in excess of any established accruals, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows in the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs or becomes probable, and potentially in future periods.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The core principal of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments, and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 using one of two retrospective transition methods. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the potential effects on its consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which amends limited sections within ASC Subtopic 835-30. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 on January1, 2016, at which time the Company reclassified approximately $6 millionof debt issuance costs associated with the Companys long-term debt from other noncurrent assets to long-term debt. A reclassification will also be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which changes how deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet. The ASU eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The Company has early-adopted the provisions of this ASU as of December 31, 2015. The provisions have been applied prospectively and had a one-time impact of reducing both current deferred tax assets and non-current deferred tax liabilities by approximately $54 millionas of December 31, 2015. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted, as permitted by the ASU64Table of Contents2.

Level 1 instruments use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, which include the Companys cash accounts, short-term deposits, and money market funds as these specific assets are liquid. Level 2 instruments are valued using the market approach which uses quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 instruments include commercial paper, corporate debt securities, United States government securities, government agency securities, asset-backed securities, and other securities as similar or identical instruments can be found in active markets.The Company recorded derivative assets and liabilities at fair value. The Companys derivatives consist of foreign exchange forward contracts. The Company has elected to use the income approach to value the derivatives, using observable Level 2 market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount assuming that participants are motivated, but not compelled to transact.Level 2 inputs for the valuations are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets specifically foreign currency spot rate and forward points and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability specifically LIBOR rates, credit default spot rates, and company specific LIBOR spread. Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient for fair value measurements. The fair value measurement of an asset or liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of the entity and the counterparty. Therefore, the impact of the counterpartys creditworthiness when in an asset position and the Companys creditworthiness when in a liability position has also been factored into the fair value measurement of the derivative instruments and did not have a material impact on the fair value of these derivative instruments. Both the counterparty and the Company are expected to continue to perform under the contractual terms of the instruments. The estimated fair value of the convertible senior notes, which we have classified as Level 2 financial instruments, was determined based on the quoted price of the convertible senior notes in an over-the-counter market on December31, 201566Table of Contents3. InvestmentsThe Companys marketable securities as of December31, 2015, were classified as available-for-sale securities, with changes in fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of shareholders equity.

This determination was based on several factors, including the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the debt issuer, and the Companys intent and ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.The following table summarizes the amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities at December31, 2015and December31, 2014, by contractual maturity in thousands:December 31, 2015December 31,  securities:Mature in one year or  after one year through three  in more than three  Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company uses derivatives to partially offset its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and expenses and on certain existing assets and liabilities.To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue and expenses of certain of the Companys subsidiaries are hedged. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses generally up to twelve months68Table of ContentsThe Company may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.The Company had a net deferred loss of $04 millionand a net deferred gain of $02 millionassociated with cash flow hedges recorded in AOCI as of December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of revenue in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses are recognized as a component of cost of sales, research and development expense, sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense in the same period as the related expenses are recognized. The Companys hedged transactions as of December31, 2015are expected to occur within twelve months.Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into foreign currency exchange loss and other, net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in foreign currency exchange loss and other, net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013.Gains or losses on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in foreign currency exchange loss and other, net. During the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, the Company recognized a gain of $52 million, $23 million, and $01 millionrespectively, as a component of foreign currency exchange loss and other, net. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures or ineffective portion or amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges.The notional principle amounts of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are $1176 millionand $1172 millionas of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. The notional principle amounts of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges is $259 millionand $304 millionas of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.The following tables show the Companys derivative instruments at gross fair value as reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December31, 2015and 2014in thousands:December 31,  as  Assets a:Foreign exchange  Liabilities b:Foreign exchange   as  Fair ValueDerivative Assets a:Foreign exchange  Liabilities b:Foreign exchange  fair value of derivative assets is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.bThe fair value of derivative liabilities is measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and is recorded as accrued other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets69Table of ContentsThe following tables show the pre-tax effect of the Companys derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December31, 2015and 2014in thousands:Years Ended December 31,Gain Loss Recognized inOCI - Effective PortionGain Loss Reclassifiedfrom AOCI into Income -Effective PortionLoss Recognized - Ineffective Portionand Amount Excluded from Effectiveness Testing201520142015 a2014 bLocation20152014Cash flow hedges:Foreign exchange  lossand other,  gains and losses reclassified from AOCI into net income for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, of which a loss of $82 millionwithin costs and operating expenses and a gain of $75 millionwithin sales, respectively, were recognized within the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December31, 2015.bIncludes gains and losses reclassified from AOCI into net income for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, of which a loss of $11 millionwithin costs and operating expenses and a gain of $04 millionwithin sales, respectively, were recognized within the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December31, 20145. Intangible AssetsThe recorded value and accumulated amortization of major classes of intangible assets were as follows in  December 31,  acquired in  relationships and other intangible assets acquired in  December 31,  acquired in  relationships and other intangible assets acquired in  Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges in 2015 or 2014. In 2013, the Company determined an acquired intangible asset related to existing technology of one of the Companys legacy products, as well as certain acquired technology assets, were impaired, as there was no future use of the assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment expense of $13 millionprimarily to cost of sales in the Statement of Operations in the year ended December31, 201370Table of ContentsThe Company capitalizes patent licenses and acquired intangible assets and amortizes them over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Amortization expense of intangible assets was $63 million, $47 millionand $54 millionfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. The expected future annual amortization expense of intangible assets recorded on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2015is as follows in thousands:For the Years Ending  expected future amortization$25,2416. AcquisitionsThe Company has recorded all acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, included the results of operations in its consolidated results as of the date of each acquisition. The tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets including goodwill acquired were accounted for based on their estimated fair values. The fair value assigned to assets acquired is based on valuations using the Companys estimates and assumptions.On October1, 2014, in order to directly serve the smaller hospital market, the Company acquired certain intangible assets from a distributor in the United States for an aggregate purchase price of $210 million, of which $180 millionwas paid in cash in 2014, and $30 millionwas retained subject to certain final price adjustments. This retained amount was recorded in Accrued and other liabilities in the Balance Sheet at December31, 2014 and was paid in January, 2015. The Company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded two intangible assets: re-acquired exclusive distribution rights, and re-acquired distribution rights and customer relationships of $09 millionand $199 million, respectively. The remaining $02 millionwas recorded as settlement for pre-existing relationships in the statements of operations in 2014.For the asset acquisition completed in 2014, re-acquired exclusive distribution rights were assigned a useful life of 3 months, and re-acquired distribution rights and customer relationships assets were assigned a useful life of 6 yearsbeginning from January1, 2015.The Company acquired a 100%interest in a distributor in Italy on April1, 2013. The Company also acquired certain assets from a distributor in Australia on August31, 2013. The Company included the financial results of these companies in the consolidated financial statements from the respective acquisition dates, and the results from each of these companies were not individually or in the aggregate material to the Companys consolidated financial statements, therefore pro forma results of operations have not been presented. These transactions had a total purchase price of $40 million, of which $37 million, net of cash received, was paid in cash and the remainder being contingent cash considerations to be paid over time. These transactions were part of the ongoing expansion of the Companys distribution network for the Companys products. A summary of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is as follows: acquired intangible assets of $20 million, property and equipment, inventory and other assets, net of liabilities, of $02 million, and goodwill of $15 million.The contingent cash considerations were paid pursuant to a calculation based on product sales of the acquired entities. The amount of the contingent consideration which was settled in the third quarter of 2014 was immaterial to the Companys results of operations or financial position.For all acquisitions completed during 2013, customer relationships had a weighted-average useful life of 7 yearsand other intangibles had a weighted-average useful life of 15 years.Revenue and earnings contributions of the acquired entities were not significant or were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these acquired entities into our existing operations71Table of Contents7.

The valuation allowance against United States deferred tax assets increased by $201 million, decreased by $116 millionand increased by $128 millionduring the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.Effective December 31, 2015, the Company early-adopted ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which changes how deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet. The ASU eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The provisions have been applied prospectively and had a one-time impact of reducing both current deferred tax assets and non-current deferred tax liabilities by approximately $54 millionas of December 31, 2015. Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted, as permitted by the ASU.As of December31, 2015, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $3414 millionand $3661 million, respectively, which, if not utilized, will expire in the years 2016through 2035. As of December31, 2015, the Company had federal research and development tax credits of $131 million, which expire in the years 2018through 2035, and state research and development tax credits of $152 million, which carry forward indefinitely. The Company also had foreign tax credits of $16 millionwhich expire between 2020through 2025.Utilization of the Companys net operating losses and research credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and research credits before utilization.Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries of approximately $45 millionand $88 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no provisions for federal and state income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both federal income taxes, subject to an adjustment for foreign income tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. The tax impact of the distribution of such foreign earnings to the United States parent would not be significant as the Companys net operating loss carryforward amount exceeds the amount of undistributed earnings.The Company maintains liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These liabilities involve considerable judgment and estimation and are continuously monitored by management based on the best information available, including changes in tax regulations, the outcome of relevant court cases, and other information. The Company is currently under examination in France. Although the outcome of any tax audit is uncertain, the Company believes that it has adequately provided in its consolidated financial statements for any additional taxes that the Company may be required to pay as a result of such examination73Table of ContentsThe Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Companys United States and state income tax return years 1996through 2015remain open to examination. In addition, the Company files tax returns in multiple foreign taxing jurisdictions with open tax years ranging from 2010to 2015. During 2015, a tax audit concluded in Sweden for the years 2012 through 2014. As a result, tax reserves for the relevant years were released.The following table summarizes the activity related to the Companys unrecognized tax benefits in  at beginning of  related to current year tax  for tax positions of prior years189188Decrease due to lapse of statuteDecrease due to settlements431Balance at end of year$10,585$10,298$9,241At December31, 2015and 2014, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $106 millionand $103 million, respectively, which, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate, before consideration of certain valuation allowances. The Company anticipates that the total unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change due to the settlement of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in the 12 monthsfollowing December31, 2015.The Companys policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, the Company accrued penalties and interest of $03 millionduring 2015and in total, as of December31, 2015, has recognized a liability for penalties and interest of $04 million. During 2014and 2013, the Company did not recognize any significant interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013,the Company had accrued no significant interest or penalties8. Convertible Senior Notes and Notes PayableIn February 2014, the Company issued $345 millionaggregate principal amount of 125%convertible senior notes the Notes due February1, 2021, unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. Interest is payable semiannuallyin arrears on February 1and August 1of each year, commencing on August1, 2014.The Notes are governed by an Indenture between the Company, as issuer, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Notes are unsecured and rank: senior in right of payment to the Companys future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to the Companys existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Companys secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities incurred by the Companys subsidiaries.Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Companys common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Companys election.The Notes have an initial conversion rate of 153616shares of common stock per $1,000principal amount of Notes. This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $6510per share of common stock and approximately 5,300,000shares upon conversion. Throughout the term of the Notes, the conversion rate may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events. Holders of the Notes will not receive any cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest, if any, upon conversion of a Note, except in limited circumstances. Accrued but unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid by the cash, shares of the Companys common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Companys common stock paid or delivered, as the case may be, to the holder upon conversion of a Note.Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceeding August1, 2020, the Notes will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods, only upon satisfaction of certain conditions set forth below. On or after August1, 2020, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at the conversion rate at any time regardless of whether the conditions set forth below have been met74Table of ContentsHolders may convert all or a portion of their Notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August1, 2020, in multiples of $1,000principal amount, only under the following circumstances:during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March31, 2014 and only during such calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock for at least 20trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130%of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;during the fivebusiness day period after any five consecutive trading day period the Notes Measurement Period in which the trading price as the term is defined in the Indenture per $1,000principal amount of notes for each trading day of such Notes Measurement Period was less than 98%of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on each such trading day; orupon the occurrence of specified corporate events.As of December31, 2015, the Notes are not yet convertible.Based on market data available for publicly traded, senior, unsecured corporate bonds issued by companies in the same industry and with similar maturity, the Company estimated the implied interest rate of its Notes to be approximately 50%, assuming no conversion option. Assumptions used in the estimate represent what market participants would use in pricing the liability component, including market interest rates, credit standing, and yield curves, all of which are defined as Level 2 observable inputs. The estimated implied interest rate was applied to the Notes, which resulted in a fair value of the liability component of $270 millionupon issuance, calculated as the present value of implied future payments based on the $345 millionaggregate principal amount. The excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount debt discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes. The $75 milliondifference between the aggregate principal amount of $345 millionand the estimated fair value of the liability component was recorded in additional paid-in capital as the Notes were not considered redeemable.In accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of the Notes, the Company allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components based on their estimated relative fair values. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component, totaling $72 million, are being amortized to expense over the term of the Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component, totaling $20 million, and were netted with the equity component in shareholders equity.The Notes consist of the following in thousands:Year Ended December 31,Liability  debt discount, net of  carrying amount$287,863$278,213Equity component a73,01373,013aRecorded in the consolidated balance sheet within additional paid-in capital, net of $20 milliontransaction costs in equity.The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the Notes in thousands:Year Ended December 31,20152014125%  of debt transaction costs602387Amortization of debt  of ContentsAs of December31, 2015, the fair value of the Notes, which was determined based on inputs that are observable in the market or that could be derived from, or corroborated with, observable market data, quoted price of the Notes in an over-the-counter market Level 2, and carrying value of debt instruments carrying value excludes the equity component of the Companys convertible notes classified in equity were as follows in thousands:December 31, 2015December 31, 2014Fair  Senior  connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties affiliated with the initial purchasers and others. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the Notes. Under the capped call transactions, the Company purchased capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of the Companys common stock underlying the Notes, with an initial strike price of approximately $6510per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the Notes, and have a cap price of approximately $7861. The cost of the purchased capped calls of $251 millionwas recorded to shareholders equity and will not be re-measured.Based on the closing price of our common stock of $3653on December31, 2015, the if-converted value of the Notes was less than their respective principal amounts.As of December31, 2015and 2014, the Company had notes payable outstanding of $10 millionand $12 millionrelated to a loan received from the Companys landlord in Sweden for tenant improvements. The note carries an interest rate of 4%. There are no debt covenants associated with the note9. Commitments, Debt obligations, Contingencies and Legal MattersThe following table summarizes the Companys lease, purchase and minimum royalty commitments and debt obligations at December31, 2015in thousands:Payments Due by  YearsOperating     CommitmentsWe lease building space under arrangements expiring through May 2029. The Companys manufacturing sites are located in the United States and Sweden. Certain of these lease arrangements contain escalation clauses whereby monthly rent increases over time. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease period. As of December31, 2015and 2014, the Company accrued $20 millionand $11 million, respectively, of asset retirement obligations for certain buildings currently under lease. The Company recorded approximately $04 millionin new liability and $05 millionof accretion expense in 2015 and there were no settlement or revision in the estimated cash flows in the current period. Net rent expense for all operating leases for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013was $109 million, $116 millionand $102 million, respectively.Purchase CommitmentsPurchase commitments include non-cancellable purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials used in the manufacturing of the Companys reagents and orders for purchase of systems and system modules.In February 2016, the Company finalized an agreement to purchase a building for approximately $6 million, which is not included in the table above as we were not contractually obligated to make the purchase as of December 31, 2015.Minimum Royalty CommitmentsSome of our licensing arrangements provide for a minimum royalty commitment. Royalty expense is generally based on a fee per unit shipped or a percent of revenue received for the products containing the licensed technology76Table of ContentsDebt ObligationsDebt obligations include the principal amount of our convertible senior notes due 2021, as well as interest payments to be made under the notes. Although these notes mature in 2021, they can be converted into cash and shares of our common stock prior to maturity if certain conditions are met. Any conversion prior to maturity can result in repayments of the principal amounts sooner than the scheduled repayments as indicated in the table. Please see Note 8 Convertible Senior Notes and Notes Payable for further discussion of the terms of the convertible senior notes.Bank GuaranteesThe Company carries bank guarantees that are subject to the terms of a certain foreign customer contract. The Company is required to maintain such guarantees until its contractual obligations are satisfied under the contract. The amount of bank guarantees held by the Company was $48 millionas of December 31, 2015. The Company had no bank guarantees as of December 31, 2014.ContingenciesThe Company responds to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. In certain cases, the Company has accrued estimates of the amounts it expects to pay upon resolution of such matters, and such amounts are included in accrued and other liabilities. Should the Company not be able to secure the resolution it expects, these estimates may change and will be recognized in the period in which they are identified.In the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of its products. Historically, costs related to indemnification provisions have not been significant and the Company is unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on its future results of operations.To the extent permitted under California law, the Company has agreements whereby it indemnifies its directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was serving, at the Companys request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the directors or officers service. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not specified in the agreements; however, the Company has director and officer insurance coverage that reduces its exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.Legal MattersIn May 2005, the Company entered into a license agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Roche Molecular Systems, Inc. Roche that provided us with rights under a broad range of Roche patents, including patents relating to the PCR process, reverse transcription-based methods, nucleic acid quantification methods, real-time PCR detection process and composition, and patents relating to methods for detection of viral and cancer targets. A number of the licensed patents expired in the United States prior to the end of August of 2010 and in Europe prior to the end of August of 2011. In August 2010, the Company terminated the Companys license to United States Patent No5,804,375 the 375 Patent and ceased paying United States-related royalties. The Company terminated the entire license agreement in the fourth quarter of 2011. In August 2011, Roche initiated an arbitration proceeding against the Company in the International Chamber of Commerce pursuant to the terms of the terminated agreement. The Company filed an answer challenging arbitral jurisdiction over the issues submitted by Roche and denying that the Company violated any provision of the agreement. A three-member panel was convened to address these issues in confidential proceedings. On July30, 2013, the panel determined that it had jurisdiction to decide the claims, a determination that the Company appealed to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court.On October2, 2013, the arbitration panel determined that it would proceed with the arbitration while this appeal was pending. On February27, 2014 the Swiss Federal Supreme Court upheld the jurisdiction of the arbitration panel to hear the case, and the case is continuing.The Company believes that it has not violated any provision of the agreement and that the asserted claim of the 375 Patent is expired, invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed77Table of ContentsBased on its ongoing evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the case, the Company believes that it is probable that this arbitration proceeding could result in a material loss. Accordingly, the Company recorded an estimated charge of $20 millionas its best estimate of the potential loss as of December31, 2014, which was included in accrued and other liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. This continues to be the Company best estimate for this potential loss as of December 31, 2015. If the Company were to incur a loss in the arbitration proceeding, depending on the ruling of the arbitrators, the Company could also be responsible for certain attorneys fees and interest; however, at this time, the Company is unable to estimate these potential amounts. Given the inherent uncertainty of arbitration and the nature of the claims in this matter, it is possible that the Company may incur an additional material charge, but an estimate of such a charge cannot be made at this time. The Company continues to strongly dispute Roches claims and intends to vigorously defend against them.On August21, 2012 the Company filed a lawsuit against Roche, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California the Court, for a declaratory judgment of ainvalidity, expiration, and non-infringement of the 375 Patent; and binvalidity, unenforceability, expiration and non-infringement of United States Patent No6,127,155 the 155 Patent. On January17, 2013, the Court issued an order granting a motion by Roche to stay the suit with respect to the 375 Patent pending resolution of the above noted arbitration proceeding. In the same order, the Court dismissed the Companys suit with respect to the 155 Patent for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, without considering or ruling on the merits of the Companys case. The Court left open the possibility that the Company could re-file its case against the 155 Patent in the future. Management believes that the possibility that these legal proceedings will result in a material adverse effect on the Companys business is remote.On July16, 2014 Roche filed a lawsuit in the Court, alleging that the Companys Xpert MTB-RIF product infringes United States Patent No5,643,723 the 723 Patent, which expired on July1, 2014.On September15, 2014, the Company filed its answer and counterclaims denying Roches allegations of infringement and asking the Court to find the 723 Patent invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed. On November10, 2014, the Company filed a petition for inter partes review IPR of the 723 Patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office the USPTO and filed a motion with the Court to stay this lawsuit pending the outcome of the IPR. On January7, 2015, the Court issued an order staying the lawsuit pending the outcome of the IPR. On March16, 2015, we filed a second petition for IPR of an additional claim of the 723 Patent. On June11, 2015, the USPTO issued a decision declining to institute the first requested IPR. On July13, 2015, the Company filed a request for reconsideration of the first petition for IPR with respect to certain challenged claims. On September 16, 2015, the USPTO denied the request for reconsideration. On September 17, 2015, the USPTO decided to institute our second petition for IPR. Management believes that the possibility that these legal proceedings will result in a material loss is remote.The Company may be subject to various additional claims, complaints and legal actions that arise from time to time in the normal course of business. Other than as described above, the Company does not believe it is party to any currently pending legal proceedings that will result in a material adverse effect on its business. There can be no assurance that existing or future legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows10. Shareholders EquityStock Option Plans2015 Equity Incentive PlanOn April 28, 2015, the Company shareholders approved the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan 2015 Plan, which was approved by the Board in February 2015. The 2015 Plan replaced the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan 2006 Plan and, together with our 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, are the only plans currently being used to provide stock-based incentive compensation to our eligible employees and non-employee directors. However, options or restricted stock units granted or shares issued under the 2006 Plan that were outstanding on the date the 2006 Plan was replaced by the 2015 Plan will remain subject to the terms of the 2006 Plan. Shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan include i an initial authorization of 4,600,000shares of common stock, ii any reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the 2006 Plan on the effective date of April 28, 2015, iii shares that are subject to options or other awards granted under the 2006 Plan that are cancelled, forfeited, repurchased or that expire by their terms without shares being issued after the effective date for any reason, iv shares issued under the 2006 Plan before or after the effective date pursuant to the exercise of options or stock appreciation rights that are, after the effective date, forfeited, v shares issued under the 2006 Plan that are repurchased by the Company at the original issue price, and vi shares that are subject to options or other awards granted under the 2006 Plan that otherwise terminate without shares being issued. The following shares may not be made available for future grant and issuance under the 2015 Plan: a shares withheld under the 2015 Plan to pay the exercise or purchase price or to satisfy tax withholding obligations; b shares not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of an outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right; or c shares repurchased with the proceeds of an option exercise price. The Company will reserve and keep available a sufficient number of shares to satisfy the requirements of all outstanding awards granted under the 2015 Plan78Table of ContentsUnder the 2015 Plan, the Company may grant incentive stock options ISOs and non-qualified stock options NQSOs, restricted stock awards RSAs, stock bonus awards SBAs, stock appreciation rights SARs, restricted stock units RSUs and performance awards PAs. ISOs may be granted only to employees and all other awards may be granted to employees, consultants, directors, and non-employee directors of the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the Company provided that they render bona fide services not in connection with the offer and sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction. Any award other than an option or a SAR shall reduce the number of shares available for issuance by 217shares, which differs from the 2006 Plan, which reduced it by only 175shares. Awards issued as an option or SAR shall reduce the number of shares available for issuance by the number of shares underlying the award, regardless of the number of shares actually issued upon exercise of the award. The 2015 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board Committee or by the Board acting as the Committee. RSAs, SBAs, RSUs and PAs collectively, Full Value Equity Awards with vesting or settlement restrictions, as applicable, based upon completion of performance goals, have a minimum one-year vesting or settlement restriction period the One-Year Restriction Period and all other vesting or settlement restrictions, as applicable, for Full Value Equity Awards shall have a minimum three-year vesting or settlement restriction period the Three-Year Restriction Period and together with the One-Year Restriction Period, the Minimum Restriction Periods. The Company may grant Full Value Equity Awards without taking into account the Minimum Restriction Periods, provided, that, the Company does not grant more than 5%of the aggregate shares reserved and available for grant and issuance pursuant to the 2015 Plan without such Minimum Restriction Periods. The following provides a general description of each type of award under the 2015 Plan. As of December31, 2015, the Company had 6,260,590shares of the Companys common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2015 Plan.Stock optionsmay be granted at no less than the fair market value per share of common stock on the date of the grant at 110%of fair market value for ISOs granted to 10%shareholders, expire not later than seven yearsfrom the date of grant five yearsfrom the date of grant for ISOs granted to 10%shareholders and generally vest 25%one year after the vesting commencement date and then on a pro rata basis over the following 36 months.RSAsmay be granted at a purchase price that is less than fair market value on the date of grant, and the restrictions are determined by the Committee and may be based on years of service with the Company or completion of performance goals during a period. The Committee will determine the extent that the RSA is earned prior to the payment for the shares awarded.RSUsare awards for past or future services that may be settled in cash or shares of common stock, including restricted stock. The Committee determines the terms of each RSU, including the number of shares of common stock subject to the RSU, the times during which the RSU may be settled, the consideration to be made on settlement, and the effect of the participants termination on each RSU. If RSUs are awarded based on performance goals, the Committee will determine the extent that the RSU is earned. The number of shares subject to the RSU may be fixed or may vary depending on performance goals determined by the Committee. While the RSU shall be paid currently, under certain circumstances the Committee may permit the participant to defer settlement of the RSU.PAsare awards denominated in shares of common stock that, at the sole discretion of the Committee, may be settled in cash or issuance of such shares which may consist of restricted stock or a combination thereof. Any PA that is comprised of a share bonus will have an initial value equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. The Committee will determine the terms of each PA, including the number of shares of common stock subject to the PA, the performance factors and the period that shall determine the extent to which each PA shall be settled, and the effect of the participants termination upon a change of control. Prior to the applicable settlement period, the Committee will determine the extent that the PSA is earned. No participant in the 2015 Plan will be eligible to receive more than $5,000,000in PAs in any calendar year2006 Equity Incentive PlanFollowing the effective date of the 2015 Plan on April 28, 2015, no further grants will be made under 2006 Plan.
