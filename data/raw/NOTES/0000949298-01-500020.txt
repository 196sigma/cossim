THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
CENTRAL PARKING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Central
Parking Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2001 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended September 30, 2001. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement
Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and financial statement Schedule
IV - Mortgage Loans on Real Estate as of September 30, 2001 and for each of the
years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2001. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Central
Parking Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 30, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

-  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows a Organization and Basis of Presentation
Central Parking Corporation CPC is a United States company chartered in
the State of Tennessee. The consolidated financial statements include accounts
of Central Parking Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company or Central
Parking including Central Parking System, Inc. CPS and its wholly-owned
U.S. subsidiaries; Kinney System Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries Kinney; Central Parking System of the United Kingdom, Ltd. and
its wholly-owned subsidiary CPS-UK; Central Parking System Realty, Inc. and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries Realty; Allright Holdings, Inc. and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries Allright, including Edison Parking Management,
L.P. Edison, a 50% owned partnership under Allright control. The results of
operations of the remaining 50% of Edison are eliminated as a minority interest.
All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated.
The Company owns, operates and manages parking facilities and provides
parking consulting services throughout the world, but principally in the United
States and United Kingdom. The Company manages and operates owned or leased
parking facilities, manages and operates parking facilities owned or leased by
third parties, and provides financial and other advisory services to clients.
b Revenues
Parking revenues include the parking revenues from leased and owned
locations. Management contract revenues represent revenues both fixed and
performance-based fees from facilities managed for other parties, and
miscellaneous management fees for accounting, insurance and other ancillary
services such as consulting and transportation management services. Parking
revenues from transient parking are recognized as cash is received. Parking
revenues from monthly parkers, fixed fee management contract revenues and
miscellaneous management fees are recognized on a monthly basis based on the
terms of the underlying contracts. Management contract revenues related to
performance-based arrangements are accrued when the performance measures have
been met.
Management accounts payable reflected on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets is reflected net of cash. Such cash balances belong to the owners
of the various managed facilities, but they are held by the Company and are used
to pay expenses of the managed facilities and ultimately to settle the balance
due to the owners of the managed facilities.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers cash
and cash equivalents to include cash on hand, in banks, and short-term, highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
d Investments
Investment securities consist of debt obligations of states and political
subdivisions and are classified into one of three categories, as follows: i
held-to-maturity debt securities, ii trading securities, and iii securities
available-for-sale. Classification of a debt security as held-to-maturity is
based on the Company positive intent and ability to hold such security to
maturity. At September 30, 2001 and 2000, all of the Company investment
securities were classified as held-to-maturity. Such securities are stated at
amortized cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts,
unless there is a decline in value which is considered to be other than
temporary, in which case the cost basis of such security is written down to fair
value and the amount of the write-down is reflected in earnings.
e Property, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements
Property, equipment, computer software, computer hardware, and leasehold
improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided principally on a
straight-line basis over a period of one to fifteen years for furniture,
fixtures, and equipment, over three years for computer software, over five years
for computer hardware, and over thirty to forty years for buildings and garages.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining lease term or the
estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Major additions and
improvements to property and equipment are capitalized. Repair and maintenance
costs are charged to operating expense as they are incurred.
f Investment in and Advances to Partnerships and Joint Ventures
The Company has a number of joint ventures to operate and develop parking
garages through either corporate joint ventures, general partnerships, limited
liability companies, or limited partnerships. The financial results of the
Company joint ventures are generally accounted for under the equity method and
are included in equity in partnership and joint venture earnings in the
accompanying consolidated statements of earnings with the exception of Edison,
which is consolidated into the Company financial statements, with the
remaining 50% eliminated through minority interest.
g Investment in Edison Parking Management, L.P.
On June 1, 1997, Allright acquired a 50% controlling interest in Edison.
Edison assets include management contracts contributed by the limited partner,
Park Fast Parking Management, L.P. Park Fast, a third party. These
management contracts were recorded at their estimated fair market value and are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which
average 12 years.
In conjunction with the Company merger with Allright, Allright entered
into a restructuring agreement whereby Allright loaned an additional $99
million to the limited partner and amended certain other related agreements. In
addition, the parties agreed that the limited partner capital account would be
increased to $294 million as of the effective date of the restructuring, which
coincided with the consummation date of the merger with Allright. As a result of
this increase in the limited partner capital account, the Company recorded a
$70 million charge to operations concurrent with the merger. Such charge is
reflected in merger costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings
for fiscal 1999.
h Contract and Lease Rights
Contract and lease rights consist of capitalized payments made to third
parties which provide the Company the opportunity to manage or lease facilities.
Contract and lease rights are allocated among respective locations and are
amortized principally on a straight-line basis over the terms of related
agreements which range from five to thirty years, or an estimated term
considering anticipated terminations and renewals.
i Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of
net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
periods to be benefited, ranging from five to thirty years.
j Other Assets
Other assets is comprised of a combination of the cash surrender value of
key man life insurance policies, security deposits, key money deposits with
clients, deferred issuance costs related to the sale of Preferred Securities
discussed in Note 10, deferred debt issuance costs related to the Company
credit facilities, and non-compete agreements. Key money represents deposits and
prepayments tendered to clients at the inception of long-term relationships, and
is amortized over the life of the applicable lease. Non-compete agreements are
amortized over the life of the agreement, or the economic useful life whichever
is shorter. Deferred issuance costs related to the Preferred Securities are
amortized over the 30-year life of the underlying subordinated debentures.
Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the related debt.
k Lease Transactions and Related Balances
The Company accounts for operating lease obligations and sublease income on
a straight-line basis. Contingent or percentage payments and receipts are
recognized when operations indicate such amounts will be paid or received. Lease
obligations paid in advance are included in prepaid rent. The difference between
actual lease payments and straight-line lease expenses over the lease term is
included in accrued expense or deferred rent, as appropriate. Rent expense for
all operating leases and rental income from subleases are reflected in cost of
parking, or general and administrative expenses.
In connection with its acquisitions, the Company revalued certain leases to
estimated fair market value at the time of the respective acquisition. Favorable
operating leases of entities acquired represent the present value of the excess
of the current market rental over the contractual lease payments. Unfavorable
operating leases of entities acquired represent the present value of the excess
of the contractual lease payments over the current market rental. Such write-ups
and write-downs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life
of the underlying lease, or 30 years, whichever is shorter. Favorable and
unfavorable lease rights are reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets in contract and lease rights and other liabilities, respectively.
l Property-Related Gains Losses, Net
Net property-related gains and losses on the accompanying consolidated
statements of earnings include i realized gains and losses on the sale of
owned parking facilities assets, ii impairment of long-lived assets, and iii
costs incurred to terminate existing parking facility leases prior to their
contractual termination date.
m Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including goodwill and certain identifiable intangibles,
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or the fair value less the costs to sell.
The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets to
determine if the net book values of such assets continue to be recoverable over
the remainder of the original estimated useful life. In performing this review
for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the
expected net future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is
less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized
based on the estimated diminution of value. If the assets involved are to be
held and used in the operations of the Company, consideration is also given to
actions or remediations the Company might take in order to achieve the original
estimates of cash flows.
n Income Taxes
The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company
uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. Work opportunity tax credits are
accounted for by the flow-through method, which recognizes the credits as
reductions of income tax expense in the year utilized. The Company does not
provide for federal income taxes on the accumulated earnings considered
permanently reinvested in foreign subsidiaries.
o Pre-opening Expense
The direct and incremental costs of hiring and training personnel
associated with the opening of new parking facilities and the associated
internal development costs are expensed as incurred.
p Per Share and Share Data
Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity.
q Foreign Currency Translation
The financial position and results of operations of the Company foreign
subsidiaries and equity method joint ventures are measured using local currency
as the functional currency. Translation adjustments arising from the differences
in exchange rates from period to period are generally included in the currency
translation adjustment in shareholders' equity.
r Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company discloses the fair values of on- and off-balance sheet
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value. Fair
value disclosures exclude certain financial instruments such as trade
receivables and payables when carrying values approximate the fair value. Fair
value disclosures are not required for employee benefit obligations, lease
contracts, and all non-financial instruments such as land, buildings and
equipment. The fair values of the financial instruments are estimates based upon
current market conditions and quoted market prices for the same or similar
instruments as of September 30, 2001. Book value approximates fair value for
substantially all of the Company assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet
derivatives that fall under the fair value disclosure requirements.
s Stock Option Plan
The Company applies the intrinsic value based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board opinion No. 25 APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock options. As such, compensation expense would be
recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying
stock exceeded the exercise price.
t Business Concentrations
Approximately 41% of the Company total revenues for fiscal year 2001 were
attributable to parking and management contract operations geographically
located in the Northeastern area of the United States. See also Note 18.
As of September 30, 2001, approximately 29% of the Company employees are
subject to various collective bargaining agreements as members of unions.
u Risk Management
The Company utilizes a combination of indemnity and self-insurance
coverages up to certain maximum losses for liability, health and workers'
compensation claims. The accompanying consolidated balance sheets reflect the
estimated losses related to such risks. These policies have deductibles of up to
$250,000 per occurrence which must be met before the insurance companies are
required to reimburse the Company for costs and liabilities related to covered
claims. As a result, the Company is, in effect, self-insured for all claims up
to the deductible levels.
v Use of Estimates
Management of the Company has made certain estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities to prepare these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.
w Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses variable-rate debt to finance its operations. These debt
obligations expose the Company to variability in interest payments due to
changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense
increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also
decreases. Management believes it is prudent to limit the variability of its
interest payments.
To meet this objective, management enters into various types of derivative
instruments to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate
risk. These instruments include interest rate swaps and caps. Under the interest
rate swaps, the Company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed
interest rate payments, thereby creating fixed-rate debt. The purchased interest
rate cap agreements also protect the Company from increases in interest rates
that would result in increased cash interest payments made under its Credit
Facility. Under the agreements, the Company has the right to receive cash if
interest rates increase above a specified level.
The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose
other than cash flow hedging purposes. That is, the Company does not speculate
using derivative instruments. The Company assesses interest rate cash flow risk
by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures
that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging
opportunities.  The Company maintains risk management control systems to
monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both the Company
outstanding or forecasted debt obligations as well as the Company offsetting
hedge positions. The risk management control systems involve the use of
analytical techniques, including cash flow sensitivity analysis, to estimate the
expected impact of changes in interest rates on the Company future cash flows.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS
No. 133 established reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. Under SFAS No. 133,
the Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities, measured
at fair value, in the statement of financial position. In June 2000, SFAS No.
138 Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 was issued clarifying the
accounting for derivatives under the new standard.
On October 1, 2000, the Company prospectively adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138, which resulted in the recording of a net
transition loss of $380 thousand, net of related income taxes of $253 thousand,
in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Further, the adoption of SFAS No. 133
and SFAS No. 138 resulted in the Company reducing derivative instrument assets
by $280 thousand and recording $353 thousand of derivative instrument
liabilities.
At September 30, 2001, the Company derivative financial instruments
consist of three interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount of
$75 million and two interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $38
million that effectively convert an equal portion of its debt from a floating
rate to a fixed rate. The derivative financial instruments are reported at
their fair values. These instruments comprised derivative instrument assets of
$63 thousand and derivative instrument liabilities of $30 million, which are
included as other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the face of the
balance sheet. During the year ended September 30, 2001, the Company recognized
an additional unrealized loss of $17 million, net of related income tax benefit
of $12 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Additionally, the
Company decreased derivative instruments assets by $267 thousand and increased
derivative instrument liabilities by $26 million for the year ended September
30, 2001.
x Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue recognition
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB
101. The Company adopted SAB 101 during the quarter ended March 31, 2001 as a
change in accounting principle retroactive to October 1, 2000. Adoption of SAB
101 required the Company to change the timing of recognition of
performance-based revenues on certain management contracts. The cumulative
effect of this accounting change was a loss of $429 thousand $258 thousand, net
of tax as of October 1, 2000. Adoption of SAB 101 resulted in an increase in
management contract revenues of $47 thousand for the year ended September 30,
2001
Business combinations, goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets
In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 141 also specifies criteria which intangible
assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be
recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but
instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets
with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful
lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
The Company was required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 141
immediately. SFAS No. 142 must be adopted by October 1, 2002, but may be
adopted as of October 1, 2001. The Company intends to elect this early
adoption. SFAS No. 142 requires that the Company evaluate its existing
intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business
combination, and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform
with the new criteria in SFAS No. 141 for recognition apart from goodwill. Upon
adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company will be required to reassess the useful
lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business
combinations, and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end
of the first interim period after adoption. In addition, to the extent an
intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life, the Company
will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 142 within the first interim period. Any impairment
loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim
period.
In connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation, SFAS
No. 142 will require the Company to perform an assessment of whether there is an
indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption. To accomplish
this the Company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying
value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including
the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the
date of adoption. The Company will then have up to six months from the date of
adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to
the reporting unit carrying amount. To the extent a reporting unit carrying
amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit
goodwill may be impaired and the Company must perform the second step of the
transitional impairment test. In the second step, the Company must compare the
implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill, determined by allocating
the reporting unit fair value to all of its assets recognized and
unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation
in accordance with SFAS No. 141, to its carrying amount, both of which would be
measured as of the date of adoption.  This second step is required to be
completed as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the year of
adoption. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in the Company statement of
earnings.
As of September 30, 2001, the Company unamortized goodwill amounted to
$2506 million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets amounted to $881
million, all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of SFAS No.
142. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $114 million for each of the
years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000. Because of the extensive effort needed
to comply with adopting SFAS No. 141 and 142, it is not practicable to
reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these Statements on the Company
financial statements at the date of this report, including whether any
transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations associated
with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition,
construction, development and or normal use of the asset.
SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability
is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional
carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The liability is
accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense. If the
obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, the
Company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement.
The Company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 143
for the quarter ending December 31, 2002. Management does not expect such
adoption to have a material effect on the Company financial statements.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which supersedes both SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting
the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined
in that Opinion. SFAS No. 144 retains the fundamental provisions in SFAS No.
121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets held
for use and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, while also resolving
significant implementation issues associated with SFAS No. 121. For example,
SFAS No. 144 provides guidance on how a long-lived asset that is used as part of
a group should be evaluated for impairment, establishes criteria for when a
long-lived asset is held for sale, and prescribes the accounting for a
long-lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale. SFAS No. 144
retains the basic provisions of Opinion 30 on how to present discontinued
operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a
component of an entity rather than a segment of a business. Unlike SFAS No.
121, an impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144 will never result in a
write-down of goodwill. Rather, goodwill is evaluated for impairment under SFAS
No. 142.
The Company is required and plans to adopt SFAS No. 144 for the quarter
ending December 31, 2002. Management does not expect such adoption to have a
material impact on the Company financial statements because the impairment
assessment under SFAS No. 144 is largely unchanged from SFAS No121.
y Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. Certain reclassifications have been made to Allright
historical financial statements to conform to the Company presentation. 2 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Allright Merger
On March 19, 1999, Central Parking completed a merger with Allright,
pursuant to which approximately 70 million shares of Central Parking common
stock and approximately 05 million options and warrants to purchase common
stock of Central Parking, were exchanged for all of the outstanding shares of
common stock and options and warrants to purchase common stock of Allright. The
transaction has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Accordingly,
Central Parking consolidated financial statements have been restated to

Central Parking and Allright as if Allright for all periods presented.
The Company incurred merger costs of approximately $37 million and $410
million in fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively, in connection with the merger

incremental to the combining companies, were recognized when incurred and are
reflected in the accompanying statement of earnings as merger costs. Included in
these costs are approximately $220 million for professional fees; comprised of
investment banking, legal, accounting, and consulting fees; $124 million
related to employment agreements and severance contracts; $70 million related
to the restructuring agreement with the limited partner of Edison See Note

transaction was financed by the seller see Note 9. The lease rights are being
amortized over 17 years, the remaining term of the lease, and the contract
rights are being amortized over 35 years.
Pro forma results for fiscal 2000 and 1999 are not presented as the impact of

In connection with the acquisition of Kinney System Holding
Corporation Kinney in February 1998, the Company acquired a note receivable
from the City of New York the City related to two parking garages which were
built on behalf of the City. The Company also has a long-term management
agreement to operate the parking garages. Amounts advanced for the construction
of the garages were recorded as a note receivable and are being repaid by the

December 2007. In connection with the purchase, the note receivable was recorded
at estimated fair value. At September 30, 2001, the book value of the note
receivable was $96 million.
In June 1997, Allright loaned the limited partner of Edison $165 million
in connection with Allright acquisition of its general partnership interest in
Edison. In conjunction with the merger of Allright and Central Parking, the
partnership agreement was restructured and an additional $99 million was
advanced to the limited partner. The amended note receivable totals $264
million and bears interest at 10%. The note matures June 1, 2006 and is secured
by a pledge of, and security interest in, the limited partner partnership
interest in Edison.
In connection with the Allright merger, the Company acquired a mortgage
note of $25 million, bearing interest at 77%, from a partnership which is
secured by a parking garage and rental assignments. The loan is a balloon note
which matures in August 2010.
In connection with the acquisition of Allied, the Company obtained notes
receivables totaling $49 million, secured by an assignment of rents from the
properties being leased. The notes are payable monthly and bear interest at the
rate of 70%.
The remainder of the notes receivable consist of notes ranging from $3
thousand to $31 million at the end of fiscal 2001, and notes ranging from $10
thousand to $11 million at the end of fiscal 2000. The notes bear interest at

The Company routinely disposes of owned properties due to various factors,
including economic considerations, unsolicited offers from third parties and
condemnation proceedings initiated by local government authorities. Leased
properties are also periodically evaluated and determinations may be made to
sell or exit a lease obligation. Additionally, during the years ended September

facilities pursuant to a settlement agreement with the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice the DOJ in connection with the merger
with Allright.

Included in net gains on sale of property for fiscal 2001 is a $250
thousand loss for environmental liability costs related to a property previously
owned by the Company. The Company recorded impairment charges of $83 million in
fiscal 2001, including $55 million attributable to properties where the
carrying value of goodwill, contract rights and lease rights was no longer
supportable by projected future cash flows, and $28 million related to
equipment and leasehold improvements. Of these impairment charges, $34 million
related to properties in New York, $28 million in San Francisco, $07 million
in New Jersey and the remaining $14 million in various other locations. The
Company also incurred $77 million of costs to exit unfavorable lease
agreements.
Impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2000 include $33 million
attributable to assets subsequently disposed of during the year. These
impairment charges were derived using estimates of net realizable values. The
remaining $15 million impairment charge was attributable to assets held for
use, and was based on estimated fair value using estimated cash flows of the
applicable parking facility discounted at the Company average cost of funds.
In fiscal 1999, the Company recognized an impairment charge of
approximately $12 million related to a parking facility the Company was in the
process of selling. The transaction closed in early fiscal 2000. 8 INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES

b Commerce Street Joint Venture
The Company has a 50% interest in a joint venture that owns a parking
complex in Nashville, Tennessee. The complex consists of the original parking
garage and retail space the Original Facility and an addition to the parking
garage the Addition constructed several years after the completion of the
Original Facility.
The joint venture financed the Original Facility with industrial
development bonds in the original principal amount of $86 million the Series
A Bonds issued by The Industrial Development Board of the Metropolitan
Government of Nashville and Davidson County the Metro IDB. The Metro IDB
holds title to the Original Facility, which it leases to the joint venture under
a lease expiring in 2016. The lease of the Original Facility obligates the
venture to make lease payments corresponding to principal and interest payable
on Series A Bonds and provides the venture with an option to purchase the
Original Facility at any time by paying the amount due under the Series A Bonds
and making a nominal purchase payment to the Metro IDB.
Also included in investments in and advances to partnerships and joint
ventures are the Series B Bonds purchased in April 1994 relating to the Commerce
Street Joint Venture in the amounts of $607 thousand and $668 thousand at

and principal payments at the index rate prime plus 250 basis points 85% at
September 30, 2001 through 2009. The minimum interest rate is 75% and the
maximum interest rate is 12%. The Bonds are secured by a mortgage on the project
which is subordinate to the industrial development bonds. The remainder of the
Series B Bonds are owned by the other joint venture partner.
c Larimer Square Parking Associates
The Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture that owns a parking
complex in Denver, Colorado. The complex, which was completed in February 1996,
was constructed and financed by the joint venture partners. The Company invested
$991 thousand in the joint venture and loaned the joint venture $11 million in
the form of a construction note, bearing interest at 95%, which was converted
to a term note in August 1996, following completion of the project. An
additional $14 million was loaned by the Company which will be repaid through
sales tax and property tax revenues by the Denver Urban Renewal Authority at an
interest rate of 10%. The Company manages the parking facility for the venture.
d 12 West 48th Street, LLC
In connection with the Kinney acquisition, the Company acquired a 40%
interest in a limited liability company which owns and operates a garage and two

cash. The previous partner will continue to manage the garage through June 2006.
e Lodo Parking Garage, LLC

Total long-term obligations             $223,135  $253,535
On March 19, 1999, the Company established a new credit facility the
Credit Facility providing for an aggregate availability of up to $400 million
consisting of a five-year $200 million revolving credit facility including a
sub-limit of $25 million for standby letters of credit, and a $200 million
five-year term loan. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a grid
based margin dependent upon Central Parking achieving certain financial ratios.
The amount outstanding under the Company Credit Facility as of September 30,
2001 was $2380 million with a weighted average interest rate of 41%, including
the principal amount of the term loan of $1250 million which is being repaid in
quarterly payments of $125 million through March 2004. The Credit Facility
contains covenants including those that require the Company to maintain certain
financial ratios, restrict further indebtedness and limit the amount of
dividends paid. The aggregate availability under the Credit Facility was $596
million at September 30, 2001, which is net of $274 million of stand-by letters
of credit.
The Credit Facility contains covenants including those that require the
Company to maintain certain financial ratios, restrict further indebtedness and
limit the amount of dividends paid. On December 28, 1999 the Company entered
into an amendment and waiver to the Credit Facility agreement relating to the
waiver of non-compliance with certain loan covenants at September 30, 1999. This
amendment and waiver contained, among other things, amendment fees of $700
thousand, which are being amortized over the life of the Credit Facility. The
grid-based interest rate margin was not affected by the amendment and continues
to be based upon the Company achieving certain revised financial ratios. As of
September 30, 2001, the Company was in compliance with all covenants or had
obtained applicable waivers.
On February 14, 2000, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement
to the Credit Facility agreement primarily to allow the Company to repurchase up
to $50 million in outstanding shares of its common stock. This amendment and
restatement required the Company to pay an amendment fee of $681 thousand, which
is being amortized over the life of the Credit Facility. Interest rates were not
affected by this amendment.
The Company is required to continue maintaining the aforementioned
financial covenants under the Credit Facility as of the end of each fiscal
quarter. Due to a decline in revenues resulting primarily from the recession and
the September 11 tragedy, the Company may not be in compliance with one or more
of these covenants as of the end of the first or second quarters of fiscal 2002.
As a result, the Company has begun discussions with its lender group regarding
potential amendments to its Credit Facility. These amendments would, among other
things, waive or amend the financial covenants and would likely increase the
Company cost of funds under its Credit Facility by approximately 100 to 175
basis points. In addition, the Company is evaluating several financing
alternatives, including sale/leaseback opportunities, mortgage financing and
repurchase of a portion of its convertible preferred stock.
The Company is required under the Credit Facility to enter into certain
interest rate protection agreements designed to fix interest rates on variable
rate debt and reduce the Company cash flow exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates. On October 27, 1999, the Company entered into a $25 million
interest rate swap for a term of four years, cancelable after two years at the
option of the counterparty, under which the Company pays to the counterparty a
fixed rate of 616%, and the counterparty pays to the Company a variable rate
equal to LIBOR. The transaction involved an exchange of fixed rate payments for
variable rate payments and does not involve the exchange of the underlying
nominal value. On March 31, 2000, June 29, 2000, and again on September 29,
2000, the Company entered into $25 million interest rate cap agreements. The
rate is 80% for the first two cap agreements and 85% for the last cap
agreement and each has a term consistent with that of the Credit Facility. The
Company paid a total of $646 thousand for the three $25 million cap agreements.
The cost of the instruments is being amortized over the terms of the agreements.
On March 15, 2000, a limited liability company LLC of which the Company
is the sole shareholder purchased the Black Angus Garage, a multi-level
structure with 300 parking stalls, located in New York City, for $196 million.
$133 million of the purchase was financed through a five-year note bearing
interest at one month floating LIBOR plus 1625 basis points. The note is
collateralized by the parking facility. The $127 million principal balance
remaining at the end of the five-year loan term will be due in full. To hedge
the Company cash flow exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Company
entered into a five-year LIBOR swap, yielding an effective interest cost of
891% and an effective monthly principal and interest payment of approximately
$108 thousand for the five-year period. The Company guaranteed $1 million of the
debt, which otherwise would have no recourse except to the LLC. The remainder of
the purchase price was financed from borrowings from the Credit Facility.
On May 12, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement effective June 1,
2000, to acquire certain contract and lease rights for approximately $143
million. The transaction was financed by the seller at an interest rate of 732%
and is backed by a letter of credit in the amount of $15 million. Interest is
payable monthly. The seller has the option to call the note after May 1, 2003.
If the seller does not exercise such option by November 30, 2003, the Company
has the option, from May 1 2004 to November 30, 2004, to repay the outstanding
principal balance.
The Company also has several notes payable outstanding totaling $37
million at September 30, 2001. These notes are secured by real estate and
equipment and bear interest at rates ranging from 65% to 100%.
In October 1996, Allright entered into a credit agreement for the purpose
of financing the purchase of Allright Corporation CFSB Loan. Additionally,
in October 1996, Allright defeased all of its Industrial Development Revenue
Bonds IRBs in the amount of $179 million and recorded an extraordinary loss
of $10 million, net of tax. At September 30, 2001, approximately $100 million
of the IRB remain outstanding in a trust secured by U.S. Treasury Bills which
were used to defease these instruments. The CFSB Loan was repaid upon
consummation of the merger of Allright and the Company from proceeds of the
Credit Facility. The Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $10 million,
net of tax in fiscal 1999 in connection with the repayment of such amounts.

In connection with the Kinney acquisition, the Company assumed an agreement
whereby a parking structure and the corresponding land upon which it sits are
leased under a long-term arrangement. The parking structure is accounted for as
a capital lease, and the underlying land is accounted for as an operating lease.
The original agreement called for lease payments over a twenty-year term at a
174% interest rate. In connection with purchase accounting, the carrying value
of the related obligation was recorded at fair value. The carrying amount of the
capital lease obligation at September 30, 2001 was $46 million, bearing
interest at a rate of 80% per annum and requiring monthly payments of
approximately $177,000. The operating lease requires a payment of approximately
$183,000 per month. The lease agreements run through December 2003.

10 CONVERTIBLE TRUST ISSUED PREFERRED SECURITIES OFFERINGS
On March 18, 1998, the Company created Central Parking Finance Trust
Trust which completed a private placement of 4,400,000 shares at $2500 per
share of 525% convertible trust issued preferred securities Preferred

In connection with Allright acquisition of Allright Corporation in
October 1996, warrants to purchase 1,177 shares of Allright common stock at
$001 exercise price were issued. The fair value of the warrants on the date of
grant, estimated at $1,177,000, was recorded as additional purchase
consideration in the formation of Allright. As a result of the Company merger
with Allright, such warrants represent rights to acquire 103,148 shares of
Central Parking common stock. Such warrants were exercised in fiscal 2000.

Weighted average common shares used for the computation of basic earnings
per share excludes certain common shares issued pursuant to the Company
restricted stock plan and deferred compensation agreement, because under the
related agreements the holders of restricted stock will forfeit such shares if
certain employment or service requirements are not met. The effect of the
conversion of the company-obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of the
subsidiary trust has not been included in the diluted earnings per share
calculation since such securities were anti-dilutive for all periods. At
September 30, 2001, such securities were convertible into 2,000,000 shares of
common stock. Options to acquire 1,847,727, 992,352 and 481,573 shares of common
stock were excluded from the 2001, 2000 and 1999 diluted earnings per share
calculations because they were antidilutive. 12 OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS
The Company and its subsidiaries conduct a significant portion of their
operations on leased premises under operating leases expiring at various dates
through 2101. Lease agreements provide for minimum payments or contingent
payments based upon a percentage of revenue or, in some cases, a combination of
both types of arrangements. Certain locations additionally require the Company
and its subsidiaries to pay real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses.

forwards of approximately $413 million, state and city net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $957 million, and foreign net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $04 million which expire between 2002 and 2016. The
ability of the Company to fully utilize these net operating losses is limited
due to changes in ownership of the companies which generated these losses. These
limitations have been considered in determining the deferred tax asset valuation
allowance shown above. Based on prior taxable income, management believes that
it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable
income to realize deferred tax assets after giving consideration to the
valuation allowance. The valuation allowance has been provided for net operating
loss carry forwards for which recoverability is deemed to be uncertain. 14 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS
a Stock Plans
In August 1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved a stock
plan for key personnel, which included a stock option plan and a restricted
stock plan. Under this plan, incentive stock options, as well as nonqualified
options and other stock-based awards, may be granted to officers, employees and
directors. A total of 3,817,500 common shares have been reserved for issuance
under these two plans combined. Options representing 2,118,331 shares are
outstanding under the stock option plan at September 30, 2001. Options are
granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of
grant, generally vest over a three- to four-year period and generally expire ten
years after the date of grant. At September 30, 2001, 284,590 shares had been
issued through the restricted stock plan. Expense related to the vesting of
restricted stock is recognized by the Company over the vesting period.
In August 1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders also approved a
stock plan for directors. This plan provides for the grant, upon each director
initial election, of options to purchase 11,250 shares at an exercise price
equal to the fair market value at the date of grant to each non-employee
director. In addition, each non-employee director who has served for a minimum
of six months on the last day of each fiscal year will receive additional
options to purchase 5,000 shares on that date. A total of 475,000 shares have
been reserved for issuance under the plan. Options to purchase 182,000 shares
are outstanding under this plan at September 30, 2001.   The following table summarizes the transactions pursuant to the Company
stock option plans for the last three fiscal years

During the third quarter of fiscal 2001 the Company initiated and completed
a stock option buyback and cancellation program. The Company repurchased
244,375 existing options from non-executive employees with exercise prices at or
above $2925 per share. The Company recognized approximately $100 thousand as
compensation expense for the year ended September 30, 2001, related to the
option repurchases.
At September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, options to purchase 717,160, 739,499

Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly,
because such options are fixed awards, no compensation cost has been recognized.
If compensation cost for these plans had been determined consistent with SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based-Compensation, the Company net earnings

$1051 for 2001 option grants, $1203 for 2000 option grants, and $1602 for
1999 option grants, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions: weighted average dividend yield based on historic
dividend rates at the date of grant, weighted average volatility of 67% for
fiscal 2001, 70% for fiscal 2000 and 66% for fiscal 1999, weighted average risk
free interest based on the treasury bill rate of 10-year instruments at the date
of grant, and a weighted average expected life of ten years for all grants.
The Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which began on April
1, 1996, under which 450,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance. The plan allows participants to contribute up to 10% of their normal
pay as defined in the Plan to a custodial account for purchase of the
Company common stock. Participants may enroll or make changes to their
enrollment annually, and they may withdraw from the plan at any time by giving
the Company written notice. Employees purchase stock annually following the end
of the plan year at a price per share equal to the lesser of 85% of the closing
market price of the common stock on the first or the last trading day of the
plan year. At September 30, 2001, 319,766 shares had been issued under this
plan.
b Profit-Sharing and 401k Plan
The Company has the Profit-Sharing and 401k Savings Plan that allows
eligible participants to make pretax contributions, receive Company 401k match
contributions and participate in Company profit-sharing contributions.
Employees 18 years or older may participate in the Plan after one year of
continuous service, if the employee was employed prior to reaching age 65.
Participants' contributions, Company 401k contributions and earnings thereon
immediately vest. Company profit-sharing contributions vest after two years of
continuous service at a rate of 20% per year so that participants are fully
vested at the end of seven years. Company expense associated with this plan was
$22 million, $25 million, and $23 million in years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
c Incentive Compensation Agreements
The Company has incentive compensation agreements with certain key
employees. Participating employees receive an annual bonus based on
profitability of the operations and other factors for which they are
responsible. Incentive compensation expense is accrued during the year based
upon management estimate of amounts earned under the related agreements.
Incentive compensation under all such agreements was approximately $65 million 64 million and $50 million, in years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
d Deferred Compensation Agreements
The Company has an employment agreement with its President of International
Operations in which the officer is entitled to receive upon retirement 267,750
shares of common stock which were issued in 1995 under the Company restricted
stock plan. The Company recorded $705 thousand of deferred compensation expense
in its shareholders' equity in fiscal 1995, which was being amortized ratably
over the remaining expected term of the officer employment. During fiscal 2001
the agreement was amended to allow the officer to receive all of the shares if
he were to leave the Company prior to his normal retirement date.
Correspondingly, the Company transferred 267,750 shares of restricted common
stock into a Rabbi Trust the Trust owned by the Company. The officer has no
authority over the administration of the Trust. Transfer of these shares
resulted in an increase in liabilities and a decrease in equity of $705
thousand, including recognition of the remaining deferred compensation expense
of $335 thousand, which represented the unamortized portion of the deferred
compensation at the amendment date.
The Company has a deferred compensation agreement that entitles the
Chairman to receive annual payments of $500 thousand for a period of ten years
following his termination, for any reason other than death, in exchange for a
covenant not to compete. Thereafter, the officer is entitled to annual payments
of $300 thousand until his death and, in the event his wife survives him, she is
entitled to annual payments of $300 thousand until her death. The Company
recognizes annual compensation expense pursuant to this agreement equivalent to
the increase in the actuarially determined future obligation under the
agreement.   Compensation expense associated with their agreements was
approximately $591 thousand, $255 thousand and $370 thousand in fiscal years
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Agreements with certain former key executives of Allright provide for
aggregate annual payments ranging from $20 thousand to $144 thousand per year
for periods ranging from 10 years to life, beginning when the executive retires
or upon death or disability. Under certain conditions, the amount of deferred
benefits can be reduced. Life insurance contracts with a face value of
approximately $92 million have been purchased to fund, as necessary, the
benefits under these agreements. The cash surrender value of the life insurance
contracts is approximately $19 million and $18 million at September 30, 2001
and September 30, 2000, respectively, and is included in other non-current
assets. The plan is a nonqualified plan and is not subject to ERISA funding
requirements. Deferred compensation costs for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $121
thousand, $159 thousand and $557 thousand, respectively. At September 30, 2001,
the Company had recorded a liability of $62 million for accrued pension costs
associated with this plan. The weighted average discount rate and rate of
increase in future compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligations was 8%.
e Deferred Unit Plan
On December 19, 1996, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the
Company Deferred Stock Unit Plan. Under the plan, certain key employees have
the opportunity to defer the receipt of certain portions of their cash
compensation, instead receiving shares of common stock following certain periods
of deferral. The plan is administered by a committee, appointed by the board of
directors of the Company consisting of at least two non-employee outside
directors of the Company. The Company reserved 375,000 shares of common stock
for issuance under the 1996 Deferred Stock Unit Plan. Participants may defer up
to 50% of their salary. As of September 30, 2001 $14 million of compensation
has been deferred under this plan.
f Employment Agreements
In connection with the Allright merger, Allright and the Company entered
into various employment agreements with employees of Allright. These agreements
included a retention payments to be made at the closing date of the merger if
the individuals were still employees at such date, b two-year employment
agreements, 50% of each employee benefit thereunder to be paid at the closing
date of the merger and the other 50% to be paid two years after such date,
assuming the individuals were still employed with the Company, and c
continuity benefits which were to be paid six months after the closing date of
the merger, assuming the individuals were still employed at such date. As of
September 30, 2001, payments made under these agreements total $103 million.
There were no amounts accrued and unpaid related to these agreements at
September 30, 2001. Expenses associated with the two-year agreements have been
recognized in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 in the amounts of $358 thousand, $612
thousand and $317 thousand, respectively. 15 RELATED PARTIES
The Company leases two properties from an entity 50% owned by the Company
chairman for $290 thousand per year for a 10-year term and pays percentage rent
to the entity. Total rent expense, including percentage rent, was $355 thousand 434 thousand and $531 thousand in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The
Company will receive 25% of the gain in the event of a sale of these properties
during the term of the lease pursuant to the lease agreements. Management
believes that such transactions have been on terms no less favorable to the
Company than those that could have been obtained from unaffiliated persons.
In connection with the acquisition of Kinney, the Company entered into a
consulting agreement with a director of the Company. The Company paid $200
thousand to the director pursuant to this agreement during fiscal 2001.
Additionally, the Company has entered into a limited partnership agreement with
the same director whereby the director has agreed to seek new business
opportunities in the form of leases and management contracts and renewals of
existing leases and contracts as requested by the Company. During the fiscal
years ended September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company recognized expense of
$391 thousand, $220 thousand and $418 thousand, respectively, in connection with
this agreement.
During fiscal 2000, a former director of the Company exercised a purchase
option on a property owned by the Company. The purchase price was $83 million.
The Company recognized a gain of $27 million in connection with the sale of the
property. 16 CONTINGENCIES
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, which arise
in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate liability with respect to those proceedings and claims will not
materially affect the financial position, operations, or liquidity of the
Company. The Company maintains liability insurance coverage for individual
claims in excess of various dollar amounts, subject to annual aggregate limits.
In connection with the initial formation of Allright and its acquisition of
Allright Corporation, Nedinco Delaware Incorporated Nedinco and Hang Lung
Development Company Ltd. agreed to indemnify Allright for certain costs and
liabilities incurred in connection with or arising out of Allright
Corporation operations prior to October 31, 1996. A $219 million letter of
credit supports this indemnification. 17 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
