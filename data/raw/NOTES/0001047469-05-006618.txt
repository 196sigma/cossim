Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm On Internal Control Over Financial Statements    
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Abgenix,Inc. 
We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included in Item
9A., that Abgenix,Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Abgenix,Inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, `or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that Abgenix,Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Abgenix,Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Abgenix,Inc. as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004,
of Abgenix,Inc. and our report dated February25, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ERNST YOUNG LLP Palo

Abgenix,Inc. management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

ABGENIX, INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
1.ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Business and Organization 
Abgenix,Inc. Abgenix or the Company, is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on discovery, development and manufacturing of human therapeutic
antibody products for the treatment of a variety of disease conditions. The Company has proprietary technologies that facilitate rapid generation of highly specific, fully human antibody therapeutic
product candidates that bind to disease targets appropriate for antibody therapy. 
In
November2001, the Company acquired Hesed BiomedInc. Hesed Biomed. In November2000, in two separate transactions, the Company acquired Abgenix
BiopharmaInc. Abgenix Biopharma, formerly known as ImmGenics Pharmaceuticals,Inc. and IntraImmune Therapies,Inc. IntraImmune. 
Accounts
denominated in foreign-currency have been remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. The aggregate exchange loss included in determining net loss was
$08million, $17million and $05million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123R, Share-Based
Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No123 and supersedes APB Opinion No25. SFAS No123R requires that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure previously permitted under SFAS No123 will no longer be an alternative. SFAS
No123R does not change the accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in SFAS No123 as originally issued and EITF Issue
No96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. 
SFAS
No123R, which is effective July1, 2005, permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective
transition method. The Company expects to use the modified prospective transition method, which requires that compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted, modified or settled after the
effective date as well as for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested as of the effective date. As
permitted by SFAS No123, the Company currently accounts for its share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion No25 intrinsic value method and does not
recognize compensation costs for its employee stock options. Accordingly, the Company expects that the adoption of SFAS No123R fair value method will have a significant impact on the
Company result of operations, although it will have no impact on the Company overall financial position. The impact of adopting SFAS No123R cannot be predicted at this time because it
will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future. However, had the Company adopted SFAS No123R in prior periods, the impact would approximate the impact of SFAS
No123 as shown in the table below under the heading of Stock-Based Compensation. 
Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Long-Term Investments
The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. 
71  Marketable
securities consist of highly liquid debt securities with a maturity of greater than three months when purchased and marketable equity securities. The Company marketable
securities have
been classified as available-for-sale, and are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices. The Company considers its investments in marketable debt securities as
available for use in current operations. Accordingly, the Company has classified these investments as short-term, even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the
current balance sheet date. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss, which is a separate component of stockholders' equity. Unrealized losses on
available-for-sale securities that are deemed to be other than temporary are included in earnings. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts
receivable. The Company has established investment policies to limit its credit risk exposure by investing in highly liquid, high credit quality investment grade debt securities and maintaining a
diversified portfolio. The Company customers are primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the Company has not experienced any significant credit losses and does not generally
require collateral on receivables. 
Property and Equipment 
The Company records property and equipment at cost and provides depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the remaining life of the facility lease, manufacturing equipment is depreciated over 15years, and all other assets are generally
depreciated over two to five years. 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
As a result of its adoption of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in 2002, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead reviews
goodwill for impairment on annual basis, or sooner if indications of impairment exist. Under the Company accounting policy, the Company has adopted the beginning of the fourth quarter as an annual
goodwill impairment test date. Following this approach, the Company compares the carrying values as of September30 with the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to assess if there has
been a potential impairment, and, if impairment is indicated, complete the measurement of impairment under the procedures established by SFAS No142. Because the Company has determined that it
has one reporting unit under SFAS No142, its market capitalization is considered to be a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company also considers whether current
business and general market conditions suggest that the fair value of the reporting unit has likely declined below its carrying value. Intangible
assets held and used must be tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors that are
considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include a significant change in the manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the
business climate that could affect the value of an asset, including and adverse action or assessment by a regulator, and a current expectation that, more likely that not, an asset will be sold or
otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. 
As
of December31, 2004, the Company has determined that no changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate that an additional impairment of an intangible asset had
occurred. If the Company were to determine in a future period that an impairment of intangible assets had occurred, 
72  the
impairment measurement procedures could result in a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets. As of December31, 2004 the carrying value of the Company intangible assets
was $600million. 
Long-Lived Assets 
The carrying value of the Company long-lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying
amount. Long-lived assets include property and equipment, and identified intangible assets. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company receives payments from customers for license, option, service and milestone fees, as well as for contract manufacturing the Company performs. These
payments, which are generally non-refundable, are recognized as revenue or reported as deferred revenue until they meet the criteria for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue
when 1persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists; 2delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3the price is fixed or determinable and 4the
collectibility is reasonably assured, in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue Recognition. In addition, the Company has followed the
following principles in recognizing revenue: Abgenix
enters into revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in order to meet its customer needs. For example, the arrangements may include a combination of
up-front fees, license payments, RD services, milestone payments, future royalties, and manufacturing arrangements. Multiple element revenue agreements entered into on or after
July1, 2003 are evaluated under Emerging Issues Task Force No00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, to determine whether the delivered item has value to
the customer on a stand-alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists. Deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation
criteria in Issue 00-21 must be treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition. Generally, the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the last deliverable is
followed for the combined unit of accounting. For certain arrangements, the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided is not contractually defined. Accordingly, management is
required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Abgenix
has joint development arrangements under which the collaborative partners share the costs of developing and commercializing antibody therapeutic product candidates
equally. In periods where Abgenix incurs more costs under the arrangement than the collaborative partner, Abgenix records contract revenue for the services rendered. In periods where the collaborative
partner incurs more costs under the arrangement than Abgenix, Abgenix records expense for the services received.
Research
and product license fees are generally recognized only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered.
Option
fees for granting options to obtain product licenses to develop a product are recognized when the option is exercised or when the option period expires, whichever
occurs first.
Fees
the Company receives for research services the Company performs under its technology out-licensing agreements are generally recognized ratably over the
entire period the Company 
73  performs
these services. Research services include process sciences services the Company performs under its production services agreements, such as cell line development. Incentive
milestone payments are recognized as revenue when the specified milestone is achieved. Incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our
research efforts or by events external to Abgenix, such as regulatory approval to market a product. Incentive milestone payments are substantially at risk at the inception of the contract, and the
values assigned thereto are commensurate with the type of milestone achieved. The Company has no future performance obligations related to an incentive milestone that has been achieved.
Contract
manufacturing fees the Company receives under its production services agreements are recognized when the manufacture of an antibody product candidate is complete,
and the antibody product candidate is released and delivered, as defined in the relevant agreement. Research and Development 
Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel; costs associated with
preclinical testing and clinical trials of the Company product candidates, including the costs of manufacturing the product candidates; expenses for research and services rendered under
co-development agreements; and facilities expenses. Expenses for research services rendered under co-development arrangements exceed fees received from such
co-developers as reimbursements. All research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred. Manufacturing Start-up Costs 
Manufacturing start-up costs include certain costs associated with the Company new manufacturing facility, including depreciation, outside
contractor costs and personnel costs for activities such as quality assurance and quality control. In 2003, the manufacturing start-up costs included a cancellation fee for the negotiated
cancellation of an agreement with an outside contractor, Lonza Biologics plc Lonza. Effective June30, 2003, the Company canceled the November2000 agreement with Lonza for the
exclusive use of a cell culture production suite because the Company determined that with the opening of its manufacturing facility, the Company no longer needed access to the Lonza facility. Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize compensation expense for employee stock options granted at fair market value. For purposes of
disclosures pursuant to SFAS123 as amended by SFAS148, the estimated fair value of options is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the options' vesting
period. The following table illustrates what net loss would have been had 
74  the
Company accounted for its stock-based awards under the provisions of SFAS123. Pro forma amounts may not be representative of future years. December 31 2004

and shares issuable upon the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes due 2007, the convertible senior notes due 2011, the convertible subordinated note due 2013 and the redeemable convertible
preferred stock was excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share, as their effect is antidilutive for the periods presented. The

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Reclassifications 
Certain prior-year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. 
75  2.ACQUISITIONS 
Hesed Biomed 
In November2001, the Company acquired Hesed Biomed, a privately held biotechnology company with intellectual property and technology in the field of
catalytic antibodies. Abgenix acquired all of the common stock of Hesed Biomed for 537,436 shares of Abgenix common stock and warrants for the purchase of 18,731 shares of Abgenix common stock and
cash. The total purchase price was valued at $216million, including transaction costs. As a contingency for pre-acquisition liabilities of the former Hesed Biomed discovered after
the acquisition date, 61,506 shares of the Company common stock were not issued until November2002. The value of these contingency shares at the time of acquisition was $19million
and was included in acquisition liabilities on the balance sheet at December31, 2001. There were no acquisition liabilities remaining as of December31, 2002. This acquisition was
accounted for as the purchase of technology. 3.IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Identified intangible assets as of December31, 2004 and 2003 consisted of the following in thousands: Gross

unrealized gains and losses as of December31, 2004 and 2003 were reported as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss, which is a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Unrealized losses, which were primarily due to increase in interest rates, represented less than one percent of the total fair value of the Company investment portfolio. The Company has
concluded that unrealized losses are not other-than-temporary and that the Company has the intent and ability to hold temporarily impaired investments to maturities or call
date. As of December31, 2004, $2742million of marketable securities had a total unrealized loss of $12million, and the majority of these marketable securities were purchased
within the last 12months. 
The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification basis. There was no material gross realized gain or loss in 2004, 2003 and 2002. 
Other Investments 
In August2001, the Company entered into a $168million loan agreement. The first disbursement of $140million was made in
October2001 and the final disbursement of $28million was made in 
77  July2002.
The amount is included in deposits and other assets on the balance sheet. The loan bears interest at a rate of 85% per year and is payable monthly. The loan matures in
August2011 and the entire principal balance and accrued interest are due on the maturity date. 
In
2001, the Company invested $150million in equity securities of MDS Proteomics, a privately held company, in connection with a collaboration with that company. As of
December31, 2003 and June30, 2002, the Company determined that an impairment of the investment had occurred and estimated that the value of the investment had declined to zero and
$79million, respectively. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $79 and $71million, respectively, in 2003 and 2002. The amount of the charge was based on the
difference between the estimated value as determined by management and the revised or original cost basis. At December2002, the investment was recorded in long-term investments on
the balance sheet. 
5.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
At December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had notes receivable from certain officers and employees totaling $550,000 for both years, which are included in

On December21, 2004, the Company issued $3000million principal amount of convertible senior notes in a private placement. The notes are senior in
right to any existing indebtedness which is subordinated by its terms, including the Company 35% convertible subordinated notes due 2007 and convertible subordinated note due 2013. The notes are
convertible into shares of the Company common stock at an initial conversion rate of 780153 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately
$1282 per share. The notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 175% payable on June15 and December15 of each year. The notes will mature on December15, 2011 and are
redeemable at the Company option on or after December20, 2009 at the specified redemption prices. In addition, the holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase the notes,
subject to certain conditions, if the Company undergoes certain changes in control. In addition, upon certain changes in control and subject to certain conditions, additional shares of common stock
may become issuable to holders upon conversion of the notes. Holders of the notes may also require the Company to repurchase their notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest
upon the occurrence of an event of default. The Company received proceeds of $2910million from the issuance of the notes, net of initial purchasers' discount and commissions. As of
December31, 2004, the fair value of the notes was $3275million. The fair value was based on the quoted market price at December31, 2004. 
35% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 
In March2002, the Company issued $2000million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement. The notes are
convertible into shares of Abgenix common stock at a conversion price of $2758 per share subject to certain adjustments. The notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 35% and the Company is
obligated to pay interest by March15 and September15 of each year. In December2004, the Company repurchased a portion of the notes totaling $863million. In connection
with this repurchase, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $10million, which was included in the interest and other income expense, net, in the Company

Company common stock exceeds specified levels. In addition, the holders of the notes may require the Company to repurchase the notes if the Company undergoes a change in control. Holders of the
notes may also require the Company to repurchase their notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of an event of default. As of December31, 2004 and
2003, the fair value 
79  of
the notes was $1132million and $1862million, respectively. The fair value was based on the quoted market price at December31, 2004 and 2003. 
Convertible Subordinated Note due 2013 
On February19, 2004, the Company issued to AstraZeneca a convertible subordinated note with a principal amount of $500million in connection with
the redemption by AstraZeneca of the SeriesA-2 preferred stock. The note matures on October19, 2013, and no interest is payable on the note, except that, in the event of a
payment default by the Company, the note will bear interest at a rate equal to the 10-year U.S. treasury rate plus 3%, compounded annually. The note is senior to the redeemable convertible
preferred stock and the common stock and is junior to all senior indebtedness, including the 175% convertible senior notes due 2011 and the 35% convertible subordinated notes due 2007. 
The
note has the following terms similar to that of the redeemable convertible preferred stock issued to AstraZeneca in October2003: conversion rights, redemption rights and
aggregate ownership limitation. The note contains the events of default that pertain to the redeemable convertible preferred stock and an additional event of default in the case of a
cross-acceleration of $25million or more of other indebtedness of the Company. See Note9 for detail description of redeemable convertible preferred stock issued to AstraZeneca. 
8.OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 
In 2000, the Company entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement with Immunex Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AmgenInc.,
for the co-development of ABX-EGF, now known as panitumumab, a fully human antibody directed against epidermal growth factor receptor EGFr the Company created. The parties
amended this agreement in October2003. Under the amended agreement, Amgen has decision-making authority for development and commercialization activities. As under the original agreement, the
Company is obligated to pay 50% of the development and commercialization costs and is entitled to receive 50% of any profits from sales of panitumumab. Under the amended agreement, Amgen is required
to make available in 2004 and 2005 up to $600million in advances that the Company may use to fund a portion of its share of development and commercialization costs for panitumumab after the
Company has contributed $200million toward development costs in 2004. As of December31, 2004, the Company has a carrying balance of $256million under this facility consisting
of $251million in advances and $517,000 of interest accrued at the contract rate of 12% per annum. The Company drew an additional $90million under this facility in
February2005. The amount of the advances, plus interest, may be repaid out of profits resulting from future product sales; however, the Company is generally not obligated to repay any portion
of the outstanding balance if panitumumab does not reach commercialization. 
9.REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 
In October2003, in connection with a collaboration agreement, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with AstraZeneca. Pursuant to the
agreement, the Company issued to AstraZeneca $500million of SeriesA-1 and $500million of SeriesA-2 convertible preferred stock which mature
seven and 10-years, respectively, from the date of issuance. Net proceeds from these issuances were $997million. Pursuant to its terms, the SeriesA-2 preferred
stock was redeemed at the option of AstraZeneca on February19, 2004 and the Company issued AstraZeneca a convertible subordinated note with a principal amount of $500million, which
matures 10years from the initial issuance of the SeriesA-2 convertible preferred stock. Subject to various terms and conditions, if a certain milestone event is reached,
the Company will have the option to issue to AstraZeneca up to 
80  300million
of SeriesA-3 preferred stock and if a further milestone event is reached, the Company will have the option to issue to AstraZeneca up to $300million
of SeriesA-4 preferred stock. Each of the SeriesA-3 preferred stock and the SeriesA-4 preferred stock will have a maturity date that is five
years from issuance. Due to the mandatory redemption feature, the Company does not record the redeemable convertible preferred stock in stockholders' equity on its consolidated balance sheet. The
carrying value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock approximates its fair value.  Conversion rights  The Company, subject to certain conditions, can convert each series of preferred stock into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the lower of
athe average market price for the 10days prior to the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date provided that the average market price shall in no event be higher than
101% of the market price on the trading day immediately preceding the conversion date or b$3000 per share. 
AstraZeneca
may convert each series of preferred stock into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $3000 per share, at any time prior to the earlier of athe
redemption date or bthe maturity date, as applicable.  Redemption rights and maturity  The Company must redeem all outstanding shares of its SeriesA-1 preferred stock, if any, at a cash redemption price per share equal to the
liquidation preference by October29, 2010, the mandatory redemption date. 
The
Company can, upon at least 15days' notice to the holder, redeem the preferred stock for cash in an amount equal to its liquidation preference, at any time prior to maturity. AstraZeneca
has the right to require Abgenix to redeem all outstanding shares of the preferred stock at their liquidation preference, upon the occurrence of a change in control of
Abgenix after the completion of a defined research period. At its option, and subject to certain conditions, Abgenix may deliver shares of its common stock in lieu of cash upon such an event. 
AstraZeneca
has the right to require Abgenix to redeem a specified portion of the outstanding shares of preferred stock upon the occurrence of aa material breach by Abgenix of
a material obligation under the Collaboration Agreement between the Company and AstraZeneca or ba change in control of Abgenix or an acquisition by Abgenix in which the other party to the
change in control or acquisition, as the case may be, is a competitor of AstraZeneca, in each case that occurs during a defined research period and results in AstraZeneca termination of all research
programs and future programs under the collaboration agreement. The amount that AstraZeneca may require Abgenix to redeem will be based upon the extent of completion of the research programs that are
the subject of the collaboration between the Company and AstraZeneca. At its option, and subject to certain conditions, Abgenix may deliver shares of its common stock in lieu of cash upon such events. 
Upon
the occurrence of certain events of default, 1the holders of the SeriesA-1 preferred stock shall have the right to make the entire liquidation value of
the SeriesA-1 preferred stock due and payable and 2if the event of default is a payment default, quarterly cash dividends shall begin to accrue on the
SeriesA-1 preferred stock at a default rate equal to the 10-year U.S. treasury rate plus three percent 3% compounded annually. Events of default for purposes of this
provision include, but are not limited to, the following: ia failure to make a required payment, or a breach by the Company of any of the Company other obligations under, the

Liquidation, Dividend and Voting rights  The SeriesA-1 preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $50million. The SeriesA-1 preferred stock will
receive dividends or distributions if and when declared on the common stock on an as-converted basis, but shall have no other rights to dividends, except upon an event of default that is a
payment default. 
Holders
of preferred stock have the right to vote with the common stock on an as-converted basis. In addition, the preferred stock has a class vote on certain matters. Upon
an event of default that is a payment default, the preferred stock will accrue quarterly a cumulative dividend, at a rate equal to the 10-year U.S. treasury rate plus 3%, compounded
annually. 
The
preferred stock is subordinate and junior to all indebtedness and senior to the Company common stock.  Aggregate ownership limitation  At no time may any holder of SeriesA-1 preferred stock beneficially own, following the conversion of the preferred stock more than 199% of
the Company common stock then outstanding. If any shares of common stock are issuable to a holder upon conversion of the preferred stock that would result in any holder together with its
affiliates owning common stock in excess of the ownership threshold described above, then the Company will be required to redeem the shares in excess of the ownership threshold for a price equal to
1the number of such excess shares times 2the average market price of the common stock for the 30 consecutive days ending on the 15th trading day prior to the
conversion date such price, the Excess Shares Redemption Price. Upon such a redemption of the SeriesA-1 preferred stock, the Company will have the right, upon delivery of
notice to the holder, to receive a loan from the holder in the form of a interest-free subordinated promissory note. The face amount of the promissory note shall be the Excess Shares
Redemption Price.

The Company has several operating leases for its office, research and development and manufacturing facilities in California and British Columbia, Canada. The
leases expire in the year 2010 through 2015 and each includes an option to extend, other than the leases for our facilities in Canada. 
82  Future
minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases at December31, 2004 are as follows in thousands: Year ending December 31, 2005 13,848 2006 14,308 2007 14,843 2008 15,355 2009 15,858 Thereafter 56,545 Total lease payments 130,757 Less aggregate future minimum rentals to be received under sublease 1,921 128,836 Rent
expense was $141million, $144million and $136million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Purchase Commitments 
As of December31, 2004, the Company had committed approximately $25million for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements for its
manufacturing facility. 
Letters of Credit and Capital Lease 
In March2000 and February2001, the Company obtained stand-by letters of credit for $20million and $30million,
respectively, from a commercial bank as security for its obligations under
two facility leases. These were increased in January2002 to $25 and $32million, respectively, in connection with amendments to the Company facility leases. In December2003,
the $32million stand-by letter of credit increased to $35million. The outstanding stand-by letters of credit are secured by an investment account, in which
the Company maintains a balance of approximately $70million. License and Collaboration Agreements 
In October2003, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited AstraZeneca to provide for the joint
discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies against up to 36 oncology targets to be commercialized exclusively worldwide by AstraZeneca. The agreement provides that the Company will conduct
early stage preclinical research on behalf of AstraZeneca with respect to these targets. Under the agreement, the Company also may conduct clinical, process development and manufacturing activities
for which AstraZeneca is to compensate the Company at competitive market rates. The collaboration agreement also includes a co-development component under which Abgenix will be able to
generate additional antibody product candidates against up to 18 targets that AstraZeneca will have the option to co-develop with Abgenix. The companies will share development costs and
responsibilities for any co-development candidates selected by AstraZeneca. During the three-year period of selection of targets for development the Company will work
exclusively with AstraZeneca to generate and develop antibodies for therapeutic use in oncology subject to various exceptions, including among others for generation and development of antigens in
accordance with existing collaborations, for antigens that the Company and AstraZeneca 
83  decide
not to pursue in the collaboration, and for certain process development and manufacturing services. 
Product Manufacturing 
In June2003, the Company canceled its November2000 agreement with Lonza Biologics plc Lonza for the exclusive use of a cell culture production
suite, because the Company determined that with the opening of its own manufacturing plant and due to changes in its portfolio of product candidates, it no longer needed access to the Lonza facility.
Upon canceling the agreement, the Company became obligated to pay Lonza four equal installments of 4,250,000 British pounds on October1, 2003, February1, 2004, May1, 2004 and
August1, 2004. The value of this obligation on the effective date of June30, 2003 was approximately $280million. In July2004, the Company made the final installment
payment to Lonza. As of December31, 2004 the Company had no remaining obligations to Lonza. 
11.COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/LOSS  Other comprehensive income/loss consists of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities. The components of comprehensive
loss, net of tax, were as follows: December 31 2004
2003
2002 in thousands Net loss 187,478 196,429 208,898 Other comprehensive income loss Unrealized holding gains losses arising during the period 530 4,705 52,075 Less: reclassification adjustment for losses recognized in net loss 67,277 Change in unrealized gains on securities 530 4,705 15,202 Comprehensive loss 186,948 191,724 193,696 12.IMPAIRMENT OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
In the quarter ended June30, 2004, management determined that an impairment of the Company acquired technology in the field of catalytic antibodies had
occurred and that the estimated value had declined to zero. This technology, which includes intellectual property, was acquired in 2001 through the acquisition of Hesed Biomed,Inc. The Company
decided to focus its resources on other research and development projects and decided to wind down its catalytic antibody program. Additionally, after assessing the associated patent position and the
likelihood of sale or license of the technology to a third party, management further determined in the quarter ended June30, 2004 that the possibility of generating positive future cash flows
from the technology was remote. As a result of this determination, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $172million in the second quarter of 2004. 
In
the quarter ended March31, 2003, the Company decided to discontinue the development of anti-properdin antibodies. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment
charge of $14million for previously capitalized costs related to licenses and research funding for the development of therapeutic antibodies to the complement protein properdin, which the
Company licensed from Gliatech,Inc. Such charge is included in 2003. 
84  13.IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS 
In 2001, the Company invested $150million in equity securities of MDS Proteomics, a privately held company, in connection with its collaboration with
that company. As of December31, 2003 and June30, 2002, the Company determined that an impairment of the investment had occurred and estimated that the value of the investment had
declined to zero and $79million, respectively. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charges of $79 and $71million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2003 and second
quarter of 2002. The amount of the charge was based on the difference between the estimated value as determined by the management and the revised or original cost basis. 
The
Company purchased an aggregate amount of $800million of common stock of CuraGen and ImmunoGen as strategic investments at various times in 1999 and 2000. In 2002, declines
in the fair value of the CuraGen and ImmunoGen common stock were deemed by the Company management to be other than temporary. Accordingly, the Company recorded a total impairment charge for the year
ended December31, 2002 of $673million. As of December31, 2004, these investments were recorded at fair value in long-term investments on the balance sheet, and the
net unrealized holding gains of $106million are reported as a component of stockholders' equity. If the Company deems these investments further impaired at the end of any future period, the
Company may incur an additional impairment charge on these investments. 
14.RESTRUCTURING CHARGE 
In October2002, the Company announced a restructuring plan, which consisted primarily of a 15% reduction in employees. A restructuring charge of
$18million was recorded in 2002 to account for severance pay, medical benefits and other costs associated with this restructuring. Of the $18million, $07million was paid in
2002 and the remainder was paid in 2003. 
15.INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME EXPENSE, NET 
Interest and other income expense, net, consisted of the following: December 31 2004
2003
2002 in thousands Interest income 6,376 9,498 19,373 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 1,016 Other income 22 455 772 Interest and other income expense, net 5,382 9,953 20,145 In
December2004, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $10million in connection with the repurchase of $863million of the 35%
convertible subordinated notes due 2007. 
16.INCOME TAXES 
No federal or state income tax expense or benefit was recorded for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, as the Company incurred net operating
losses during these periods and potential tax benefits associated with net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets were completely offset by a full valuation allowance. The Company
recorded a foreign income tax expense of $84,000 in 2003 but did not incur any foreign income tax expense in 2004 and 2002. 
85  
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets as of December31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: December 31 2004
2003 in thousands Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 239,500 165,500 Investment reserve 32,900 32,900 Capitalized research and development 21,300 17,000 Research credit carryforwards 28,000 24,100 Other 19,300 20,500 Total deferred tax assets 341,000 260,000 Valuation allowance 325,600 237,500 Net deferred tax assets 15,400 22,500 Deferred tax liabilities Purchased intangibles 11,200 19,300 Other 4,200 3,200 Net deferred taxes Realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully
offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $881million and $685million during the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Approximately $439million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relates to benefits of stock option deductions, the benefit of which will be credited to equity when realized. As
of December31, 2004, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $6700million and $1940million, respectively,
which expire in the years 2006 through 2024. As of December31, 2004, the company had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $160million
and $180million, respectively. The federal credits expire in the years 2006 through 2024. The state credits do not expire. Utilization of the Company net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could
result in the expiration of these carryforwards before utilization. 
The
Company has entered into intercompany agreements with its Canadian subsidiary, and such agreements could be unfavorably interpreted by the applicable taxing authorities, causing an
increase in income tax expense and net loss. As a result, the Company has recorded a tax liability. The assessment of income tax implications of this intercompany relationship requires significant
management judgment.

1,666 49,464 Stockholder Rights Plan 
On June2, 1999, the Company Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right, or Right, to purchase one one-thousandth share of our
SeriesA Participating Preferred Stock, or SeriesA Preferred, for each of our outstanding shares of common stock, the Common Shares. On June14, 1999, the Company entered into a
Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, or Rights Agreement, with ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C., the predecessor to Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Rights Agent, which was amended and restated
on November19, 1999, and on May9, 2002 and amended on October29, 2003. The dividend was payable to stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date,
June14, 1999. As amended, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a share of SeriesA Preferred at an exercise price of $17500,
the Purchase Price. Each one one-thousandth of a share of SeriesA Preferred has rights and preferences substantially equivalent to those of one Common Share. 
The
Rights will separate from the Common Shares and become exercisable upon the earlier of: i10days following a public announcement that a person or group has acquired
15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, or ii10 business days or such later date as may be determined by our Board of Directors following the announcement of a tender offer or
exchange offer for 15% or more of the Common Shares. Unless the Rights are earlier redeemed by our Board of Directors at a price of $001 per Right, if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the
Common Shares, each Right will entitle its holder to receive, upon exercise, Common Shares having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price. Similarly, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed, in
the event that, after a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Common Shares, ithe Company is acquired in a merger, or ii50% or more of the Company
assets or earning power are sold, proper
provision must be made so that each holder of a Right which has not been exercised will have the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal
to two times the Purchase Price. After the acquisition of 15% or more of the Common Shares but prior to such a merger or sale, the Board of Directors may exchange each Right for one Common Share. In
October2003, pursuant to the securities purchase agreement between the Company and AstraZeneca, the Company amended its stockholder rights plan to prevent AstraZeneca from
becoming an Acquiring Person for purposes of the rights plan as a result of 1its acquisition of securities of Abgenix pursuant to the securities purchase agreement; 2the
beneficial ownership by AstraZeneca and its affiliates of the common stock of Abgenix issuable upon conversion of the securities issued pursuant to the securities purchase agreement; or 3the
mandatory conversion at the Company option of the securities issued pursuant to the securities purchase agreement into shares of common stock. The Company agreed to keep this amendment in place for
a standstill period designated in the 
88  securities
purchase agreement, provided that the Company obligation to keep the rights plan amendment in place shall lapse if AstraZeneca breaches its standstill obligations in the securities
purchase agreement. The Company has agreed to continue to keep the amendment in place after the termination of the standstill period for so long as AstraZeneca does not acquire voting securities of
Abgenix that would cause AstraZeneca level of ownership to exceed that in effect on the date of the termination of the standstill period. Warrants 
In connection with the acquisition of Hesed Biomed in November2001, the Company assumed obligations under outstanding warrants for the purchase of 18,731
shares of common stock. At December31, 2004, 16,051 shares of these warrants were outstanding and expire on various dates from October2005 through February2010. See
Note2.

weighted-average fair values of options granted during the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $943, $725 and $1534 per share. 
Pro Forma Information 
Pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share is required by SFAS No123, and has been provided in Note1. The information has
been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using
a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively: risk-free interest rate of 340%, 281% and 307%; no dividend yield in 2004,
2003 or 2002; volatility factor of 090, 100 and 105; and an expected life of the option of 563years in 2004, 551years in 2003 and 554years in 2002. These same assumptions
were applied in the determination of the option values related to stock options granted to non-employees, except for the option life for which the term of the consulting contracts, 1 to
5years, were used. The value of non-employee options has been recorded in the financial statements. 
The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair
value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plans 
The Company employee stock purchase plan enables eligible employees to purchase common stock at 85% of the closing sale price on the first or the last day of
each 6month purchase period, whichever is lower. Employees may authorize periodic payroll deductions of up to 15% of eligible compensation for common stock purchases, with certain limitations.
The number of shares which may be issued under the plan is 1,000,000, plus an annual increase equal to the lesser of 1,000,000, 1% of the Company outstanding capitalization or a lesser amount
determined by the Board. The maximum number of shares that can be issued over the 10-year term of the plan is 10,000,000. As of 
90  December31,
2004, 2,096,092 shares had been authorized under the plan and 1,460,934 shares had been issued. The
Company Canadian employee stock purchase plan enables certain eligible employees to purchase common stock at the average market price on the first or the last day of each
6month purchase period, whichever is lower. Eligible employees may authorize periodic payroll deductions of up to 15% of eligible compensation for common stock purchases, with certain
limitations. The number of shares that may be issued under this plan is 200,000. As of December31, 2004, 200,000 shares had been authorized under this plan and 50,104 shares had been issued. 
Benefit Plan 
The Company has available a 401k retirement plan in the United States. Eligible employees may contribute up to 100% of their compensation up to a maximum
allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company does not match contributions and therefore no expense has been recorded. The Company also has available a retirement plan in Canada. Eligible
employees may contribute a percentage of their gross salary, up to the maximum dollar amount legislated by Canada Revenue Agency. After one year of employment, the Company matches employee
contributions up to a maximum of 5% of the employee gross salary. 
20.CUSTOMER INDEMNIFICATION 
The Company has certain agreements with customers and collaborators that contain indemnification provisions. In such provisions, the Company typically agrees to
indemnify the customer or collaborator against certain types of third-party claims. The Company would accrue for known indemnification issues if a loss were probable and could be reasonably estimated.
The Company would also accrue for estimated incurred but unidentified issues based on historical activity. There was no accrual for or expense related to indemnification issues as of
December31, 2004 and 2003.
