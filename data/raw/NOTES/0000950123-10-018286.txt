Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.   MANAGEMENTS
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation
and integrity of all information contained in this Annual
Report. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The financial statements include
amounts that are managements best estimates and judgments.   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of
December31, 2009.   The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included herein.   
46 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ultra Petroleum Corp.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Ultra Petroleum Corp. as of December31, 2009 and 2008, and
the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2009. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Ultra Petroleum Corp. at December31,
2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2009, in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.   As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company has changed its reserve estimates and
related disclosures as a result of adopting new oil and gas
reserve estimation and disclosure requirements.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Ultra
Petroleum Corp.s internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February26, 2010 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.   /s/Ernst
Young LLP   Houston, Texas   February26, 2010   
47 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ultra Petroleum Corp.   We have audited Ultra Petroleum Corp.s internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Ultra Petroleum
Corp.s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, Ultra Petroleum Corp. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2009, based on the COSO
criteria.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Ultra Petroleum Corp. as of
December31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2009 of Ultra Petroleum Corp. and our report
dated February26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.   /s/Ernst

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   All amounts in this Report on
Form10-K
are expressed in thousands of U.S.dollars except per
share data, unless otherwise noted.   Ultra Petroleum Corp. the Company is an
independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the
acquisition, exploration, development, and production of oil and
natural gas properties. The Company is incorporated under the
laws of the Yukon Territory, Canada. The Companys
principal business activities are in the Green River Basin of
southwest Wyoming and the north-central Pennsylvania area of the
Appalachian Basin.

SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   aBasis of presentation and principles of
consolidation:The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries UP Energy Corporation, Ultra Resources, Inc.
and
Sino-American
Energy through the date of the sale of the China operations. The
Company presents its financial statements in accordance with
U.S.Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
GAAP. All inter-company transactions and balances
have been eliminated upon consolidation.   bCash and cash equivalents:We
consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   cRestricted cash:Restricted cash
represents cash received by the Company from production sold
where the final division of ownership of the production is
unknown or in dispute. Wyoming law requires that these funds be
held in a federally insured bank in Wyoming.   Long-term restricted cash represents cash set aside in an escrow
account in connection with the purchase of additional acreage in
the Marcellus Shale, which closed on February22, 2010.   dProperty, plant and
equipment:Capital assets are recorded at cost
and depreciated using the declining-balance method based on a
seven-year useful life. Gathering system expenditures are
recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method
based on a 30year useful life.   eOil and natural gas properties:On
January6, 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update
ASU, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and
Disclosures. The ASU amends FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ASC Topic 932, Extractive
Activities Oil and Gas FASB ASC 932 to
align the reserve calculation and disclosure requirements of
FASB ASC 932 with the requirements in the SEC Release
No33-8995,
Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements SEC
Release
No33-8995.
The ASU is effective for reporting periods ending on or after
December31, 2009.   On December31, 2008, the SEC issued SEC Release
No33-8995,
amending oil and gas reporting requirements under
Rule4-10
of
RegulationS-X
and Industry Guide 2 in
RegulationS-K
revising oil and gas reserves estimation and disclosure
requirements. The new rules include changes to pricing used to
estimate reserves, the ability to include non-traditional
resources in reserves, the use of new technology for determining
reserves and permitting disclosure of probable and possible
reserves. The primary objectives of the revisions are to
increase the transparency and information value of reserve
disclosures and improve comparability among oil and gas
companies. The rule is effective for annual reports on
Form10-K
for fiscal years ending on or after December31, 2009.   Accordingly, the Company adopted the update to FASB ASC 932 as
of December31, 2009 in order to conform to the
requirements in SEC Release
No33-8995.
The implementation of this rule did not result in material
additions to the Companys proved reserves included in this
report as of December31, 2009.   The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for
exploration and development activities as defined by the
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. Separate
cost centers are maintained for each country in which the
Company incurs costs. Under this method of accounting, the costs
of unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and
development activities are capitalized as properties and
equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly
related to exploration and development activities but does not
include any costs related to production, general corporate
overhead or similar activities. The carrying amount of oil and
natural gas properties

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on
the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred.
Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and natural
gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would
significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs
and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a
country.   The sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future
development costs of oil and natural gas properties are
amortized using the
units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves as determined by independent
petroleum engineers. Oil and natural gas reserves and production
are converted into equivalent units based on relative energy
content. Asset retirement obligations are included in the base
costs for calculating depletion. The Company has historically
based the fourth quarter depletion calculation on the respective
year end reserve report. This methodology was utilized in
computing the fourth quarter 2009 depletion expense.   Under the full cost method, costs of unevaluated properties and
major development projects expected to require significant
future costs may be excluded from capitalized costs being
amortized. The Company excludes significant costs until proved
reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are
impaired. Excluded costs, if any, are reviewed quarterly to
determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any
impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being
amortized.   Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil
and natural gas exploration and development activities are
required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter. The
full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by SEC
RegulationS-X
Rule4-10.
The ceiling test is performed quarterly, on a
country-by-country
basis, utilizing the average of prices in effect on the first
day of the month for the preceding twelve month period in
accordance with SEC Release
No33-8995.
The ceiling limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the
present value of future net revenues attributable to proved
crude oil and natural gas reserves discounted at 10% plus the
lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any
associated tax effects. If such capitalized costs exceed the
ceiling, the Company will record a write-down to the extent of
such excess as a non-cash charge to earnings. Any such
write-down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and
result in lower DDA expense in future periods. A
write-down may not be reversed in future periods even though
higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the
ceiling.   During the first quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a
$10billion $6730million net of tax non-cash
write-down of the carrying value of the Companys proved
oil and gas properties as of March31, 2009, as a result of
the ceiling test limitation, which is reflected as write-down of
proved oil and gas properties in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. The ceiling test was calculated prior
to the adoption of SEC Release
No33-8995
and was based on prices in effect on the last day of the
reporting period, March31, 2009, reflecting wellhead
prices of $247 per Mcf for natural gas and $3391 per barrel
for condensate.   fInventories:Materials and supplies
inventories are carried at cost. Inventory costs include
expenditures and other charges directly and indirectly incurred
in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and
location. The Company uses the weighted average method of
recording its inventory. Selling expenses and general and
administrative expenses are reported as period costs and
excluded from inventory cost. At December31, 2009,
drilling and completion supplies inventory of $45million
primarily includes the cost of pipe and production equipment
that will be utilized during the 2010 drilling program.   gDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.Currently, the Company largely relies
on commodity derivative contracts to manage its exposure to
commodity price risk. Additionally, and from time to time, the
Company enters into physical, fixed price forward natural gas
sales in order to mitigate its commodity price exposure on a
portion of its natural gas production. These fixed price forward
gas sales are considered normal sales in the ordinary course of
business and outside the scope of FASB ASC Topic 815,
Derivatives and Hedging FASB ASC 815. See
Note7.   In March 2008, the FASB updated the requirements for disclosures
about derivative instruments and hedging activities. The updated
requirements are intended to improve financial reporting about
derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring
enhanced disclosures to increase transparency about the location
and amounts of

STATEMENTSContinued   derivative instruments in an entitys financial statements;
how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
accounted for; and how derivative instruments and related hedged
items affect financial position, financial performance, and cash
flows. The Company adopted these provisions effective
January1, 2009. The adoption did not have a material
impact on the Companys results of operations and financial
condition.   hIncome taxes:Income taxes are
accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on
the more likely than not criteria described in FASB
ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. In addition, we recognize the
financial statement benefit of a tax position only after
determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely
than not sustain the position following an audit.   iEarnings per share:Basic earnings
per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per
share is computed by adjusting the average number of common
shares outstanding for the dilutive effect, if any, of common
stock equivalents. The Company uses the treasury stock method to
determine the dilutive effect.   The following table provides a reconciliation of components of
basic and diluted net loss income per common share

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   jUse of estimates:Preparation of
consolidated financial statements in accordance with
U.S.GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.   kAccounting for share-based
compensation:The Company measures and recognizes
compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to
employees and directors, including employee stock options, based
on estimated fair values in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718,
Compensation Stock Compensation.   lFair Value Accounting:The Company
follows FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures FASB ASC 820, which defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under
GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
This statement applies under other accounting topics that
require or permit fair value measurements. The implementation
was applied prospectively for our assets and liabilities that
are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily our
commodity derivatives, with no material impact on consolidated
results of operations, financial position or liquidity. For
those non-financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed
at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily our asset
retirement obligation, this respective subtopic of FASB ASC 820,
was effective January1, 2009. Implementation of this
portion of the standard did not have a material impact on
consolidated results of operations, financial position or
liquidity. See Note8 for additional information.   mAsset Retirement Obligation:The
initial estimated retirement obligation of properties is
recognized as a liability with an associated increase in oil and
gas properties for the asset retirement cost. Accretion expense
is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related
assets. If the fair value of the estimated asset retirement
obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset
retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. Revisions
in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated
inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and
changes in the estimated timing of settling asset retirement
obligations.   nRevenue Recognition:Natural gas
revenues are recorded based on the entitlement method. Under the
entitlement method, revenue is recorded when title passes based
on the Companys net revenue interest. The Company
initially records its entitled share of revenues based on
estimated production volumes. Subsequently, these estimated
volumes are adjusted to reflect actual volumes that are
supported by third party pipeline statements or cash receipts.
Since there is a ready market for natural gas, the Company sells
the majority of its products immediately after production at
various locations at which time title and risk of loss pass to
the buyer. Gas imbalances occur when the Company sells more or
less than its entitled ownership percentage of total gas
production. Any amount received in excess of the Companys
share is treated as a liability. If the Company receives less
than its entitled share, the underproduction is recorded as a
receivable. At December31, 2009, the Company had a net
natural gas imbalance asset of $29million and at
December31, 2008, the Company had a net natural gas
imbalance liability of $03million.   oOther Comprehensive Income
Loss:Other comprehensive income loss is a
term used to define revenues, expenses, gains and losses that
under generally accepted accounting principles impact
Shareholders Equity, excluding transactions with
shareholders.

ASSET
RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS   The Company is required to record the fair value of an asset
retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it
incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition,
construction, development
and/or
normal use of the assets. As of December31, 2009 and 2008,
the Company recorded a liability of $174million and

December31, 2008. Exclusion from amortization is permitted
in order to avoid distortion in the amortization per unit that
could result if the cost of unevaluated properties with no
proved reserves attributed to them was included in the
amortization base. Effective January1, 2009, the Company
has determined that these costs are not significant enough to
warrant exclusion from the amortization base and has begun
amortizing the costs on a unit of production basis.

gathered from its Wyoming well locations by tanker trucks and
then shipped to other locations for injection into crude oil
pipelines or other facilities. During 2009, the Company
initiated service on the first two of four proposed central
gathering facilities. These facilities are part of the
Companys liquids gathering system designed to gather
condensate and water from various leases and wells operated by
the Company as contemplated under the Supplemental Environment
Impact Statement Record of Decision. The condensate and water
are transported to central points in the field where condensate
can be loaded into trucks or delivered into pipelines.   In Pennsylvania, the Company and our partners are constructing
gas gathering pipelines and facilities, compression facilities
and pipeline delivery stations to gather production from our
newly completed natural gas wells. Construction on these
facilities will continue throughout 2010 allowing the Company to
manage its midstream capacity to coincide with increased
capacity requirements from our drilling activities. To date,
none of the Companys natural gas production in
Pennsylvania has required processing, treating or blending in
order to remove natural gas liquids or other impurities and it
is anticipated that facilities of this type will not be required
in the future to accommodate the Companys production.

subsidiary is a party to a revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of banks led by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. which
matures in April 2012. This agreement provides an initial loan
commitment of $5000million and may be increased to a
maximum aggregate amount of $7500million at the request
of the Company. Each bank has the right, but not the obligation,
to increase the amount of its commitment as requested by the
Company. In the event the existing banks increase their
commitment to an amount less than the requested commitment
amount, then it would be necessary to add new financial
institutions to the credit facility.   Loans under the credit facility are unsecured and bear interest,
at the Companys option, based on Aa rate per annum
equal to the higher of the prime rate or the weighted average
fed funds rate on overnight transactions during the preceding
business day plus 50basis points, or Ba base
Eurodollar rate, substantially equal to the LIBOR rate, plus a
margin based on a grid of our consolidated leverage ratio

in outstanding borrowings and $2400million of available
borrowing capacity under the credit facility.   The facility has restrictive covenants that include the
maintenance of a ratio of consolidated funded debt to EBITDAX
earnings before interest, taxes, DDA and exploration
expense not to exceed
31/2
times; and as long as the Companys debt rating is below
investment grade, the maintenance of an annual ratio of the net
present value of the Companys oil and gas properties to
total funded debt of at least 175 to 100. At December31,
2009, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt
covenants under the credit facility.   Senior Notes:On March6, 2008, the

the 2009 Senior Notes pursuant to a First
Supplement to the Master Note Purchase Agreement.   The Senior Notes rank pari passu with the Companys bank
credit facility. Payment of the Senior Notes is guaranteed by
Ultra Petroleum Corp. and UP Energy Corporation.   Proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were used to repay
bank debt or for general corporate purposes, but did not reduce
the borrowings available to the Company under the revolving
credit facility. The Senior Notes are pre-payable in whole or in
part at any time and are subject to representations, warranties,
covenants and events of default customary for a senior note

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   The 2005 Plan was adopted by the Companys Board of
Directors on January1, 2005 and approved by the
Companys shareholders on April29, 2005. The purpose
of the 2005 Plan is to foster and promote the long-term
financial success of the Company and to increase shareholder
value by attracting, motivating and retaining key employees,
consultants, and outside directors, and providing such
participants with a program for obtaining an ownership interest
in the Company that links and aligns their personal interests
with those of the Companys shareholders, and thus,
enabling such participants to share in the long-term growth and
success of the Company. To accomplish these goals, the 2005 Plan
permits the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and
other stock-based awards, some of which may require the
satisfaction of performance-based criteria in order to be
payable to participants. Under the 2005 Plan, the aggregate
number of common shares issuable to any one person pursuant to
an award cannot exceed 5% of the number of common shares
outstanding at the time of the award. In addition, no
participant may receive during any calendar year, awards
covering an aggregate of more than 20million common
shares, or a cash payout with respect to any awards in excess of
$50million. The Committee determines the terms and
conditions of the awards, including, any vesting requirements
and vesting restrictions or forfeitures that may occur. The
Committee may grant awards under the 2005 Plan until
December31, 2014, unless terminated sooner by the Board of
Directors.   The 2000 Plan was adopted by the Companys Board of
Directors on May1, 2000 and approved by the Companys
shareholders on June6, 2000. The 2000 Plan was established
for the purposes of associating the interests of the management
of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates closely with
the Companys shareholders to generate an increased
incentive to contribute to the Companys future success and
prosperity; maintaining competitive compensation levels thereby
attracting and retaining highly competent and talented outside
directors, employees, and consultants; and providing an
incentive to such management for continuous employment with the
Company. The 2000 Plan operates in a very similar manner to the
2005 Plan and permits the granting of incentive stock options,
non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and
restricted stock. Under the 2000 Plan, the aggregate number of
common shares issuable to any one person pursuant to such award
cannot exceed 5% of the number of common shares outstanding at
the time of the award. In addition, no participant may receive
during any fiscal year of the Company, awards covering an
aggregate of more than 500,000 common shares. The Committee
determines the terms and conditions of the awards, including,
any vesting requirements and vesting restrictions or forfeitures
that may occur. The Committee may continue to grant awards under
the 2000 Plan until April30, 2010, unless terminated
sooner by the Board of Directors.   The 1998 Plan was adopted by the Companys Board of
Directors on October28, 1998 and approved by the
Companys shareholders on December3, 1998. Similar to
the 2000 Plan and 2005 Plan, the 1998 Plan was established as a
means to attract, retain, and motivate service providers of the
Company by providing them with an opportunity to acquire an
increased proprietary interest in the Company through the
granting of stock options. The 1998 Plan permits the granting of
non-statutory stock options. Under the 1998 Plan, the aggregate
number of common shares issuable to any one person pursuant to
an award under the 1998 Plan, together with all other
outstanding stock options granted to such person, cannot exceed
5% of the number of common shares outstanding. The Committee
determines the terms and conditions of the awards, including,
any vesting requirements and vesting restrictions or forfeitures
that may occur. The 1998 Plan remains effective and the Company
may continue to make stock option grants under the plan.   Valuation

STATEMENTSContinued   The fair value of each share option award is estimated on the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes pricing model. The
Companys employee stock options have various restrictions
including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfers and
hedging, among others, and are often exercised prior to their
contractual maturity. Expected volatilities used in the fair
value estimates are based on historical volatility of the
Companys stock. The Company uses historical data to
estimate share option exercises, expected term and employee
departure behavior used in the Black-Scholes pricing model.
Groups of employees executives and non-executives that have
similar historical behavior are considered separately for
purposes of determining the expected term used to estimate fair
value. The assumptions utilized result from differing pre- and
post-vesting behaviors among executive and non-executive groups.
The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual term of
the share option is based on the U.S.Treasury yield curve
in effect at the time of grant. There were no stock options
granted during the year ended December31, 2009.   Securities

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   PERFORMANCE
SHARE PLANS   Long Term Incentive Plans.Each year since
2005, the Company has adopted a Long Term Incentive Plan
LTIP in order to further align the interests of
key employees with shareholders and to give key employees the
opportunity to share in the long-term performance of the Company
when specific corporate financial and operational goals are
achieved. Each LTIP covers a performance period of three years.
For 2007 and 2008, each LTIP has two components: an LTIP
Stock Option Award and an LTIP Common Stock
Award. In 2009, the Compensation Committee the
Committee approved an award consisting only of
performance-based restricted stock units to be awarded to each
participant.   Under each LTIP, the Committee establishes a percentage of base
salary for each participant which is multiplied by the
participants base salary to derive a Long Term Incentive
Value. The LTIP Common Stock Award in 2007 and 2008 and the 2009
LTIP award of restricted stock units are performance-based and
are measured over a three year performance period. For each LTIP
award, the Committee establishes performance measures at the
beginning of each performance period, and each participant is
assigned threshold and maximum award levels in the event that
actual performance is below or above target levels. For the
2007, 2008 and 2009 LTIP awards, the Committee established the
following performance measures: return on equity, reserve
replacement ratio, and production growth.   For the year ended December31, 2009, the Company
recognized $58million in pre-tax compensation expense
related to the 2007 LTIP Common Stock Award, 2008 LTIP Common
Stock Award and 2009 LTIP award of restricted stock units. For
the year ended December31, 2008, the Company recognized
$36million in pre-tax compensation expense related to the
2006, 2007, and 2008 LTIP Common Stock Awards. The amounts
recognized during the year ended December31, 2009 assumes
that maximum performance objectives are attained. If the Company
ultimately attains these performance objectives, the associated
total compensation, estimated at December31, 2009, for
each of the three year performance periods is expected to be
approximately $41million, $40million, and
$102million related to the 2007 LTIP Common Stock Award,
2008 LTIP Common Stock Award and 2009 LTIP award of restricted
stock units, respectively. Additional awards of restricted stock
units were granted to eligible employees during 2009 with
estimated total compensation of $100million over the
three year performance period assuming that maximum performance
objectives are attained. The 2006 LTIP Common Stock Award was
paid in shares of the Companys stock to employees during
the first quarter of 2009 and totaled $27million.   Best in ClassProgram.In May 2008, the
Company established the 2008 Best in ClassProgram for all
permanent, full-time employees. Under the 2008 Best in
ClassProgram, participants are eligible to receive a
number of shares of the Companys common stock based on the
performance of the Company. As with the LTIP, the 2008 Best in
ClassProgram is measured over a three year performance
period. The 2008 Best in ClassProgram recognizes and
financially rewards the collective efforts of all of the
Companys employees in achieving sustained industry leading
performance and the enhancement of shareholder value. Under the
2008 Best in ClassProgram, on January1, 2008 or the
employment date if subsequent to January1, 2008, eligible
employees received a contingent award of stock units equal to
$60,000 worth of the Companys common stock based on the
average high and low share price on the first day of the
performance period. Employees joining the Company after
January1, 2008 participate on a pro-rata basis based on
their length of employment during the performance period.   The number of contingent units that will become payable and vest
upon distribution is based on the Companys performance
relative to the industry during a three year performance period
beginning January1, 2008, and ending December31,
2010, and are set at threshold 50%, target 100%, and maximum
150% levels. For each vested unit, the participant will
receive one share of common stock. The participant must be
employed on the date the awards are distributed in order to
receive the award.   For the year ended December31, 2009, the Company
recognized $09million in pre-tax compensation expense
related to the 2008 Best in ClassProgram. For the year
ended December31, 2008 the Company recognized
$12million in pre-tax compensation expense related to the
2008 Best in ClassProgram. The amount recognized for the
year ended December31, 2009 and 2008 assumes that target
performance levels are achieved. If the Company

DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   Objectives and Strategy:The Companys
major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its
natural gas and oil production. Realized pricing is currently
driven primarily by the prevailing price for the Companys
Wyoming natural gas production. Historically, prices received
for natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable.
Pricing volatility is expected to continue.   The Company relies on various types of derivative instruments to
manage its exposure to commodity price risk and to provide a
level of certainty in the Companys forward cash flows
supporting the Companys capital investment program.   Commodity Derivative Contracts:During the
first quarter of 2009, the Company converted its physical, fixed
price, forward natural gas sales to physical, indexed natural
gas sales combined with financial swaps whereby the Company
receives the fixed price and pays the variable price. This
change provides operational flexibility to curtail gas
production in the event of continued declines in natural gas
prices. The contracts were converted at no cost to the Company
and the conversion of these contracts to derivative instruments
was effective upon entering into these transactions in March
2009, with upcoming settlements for production months through
December 2010. The natural gas reference prices of these
commodity derivative contracts are typically referenced to
natural gas index prices as published by independent third
parties.   From time to time, the Company also utilizes fixed price forward
gas sales to manage its commodity price exposure. These fixed
price forward gas sales are considered normal sales in the
ordinary course of business and outside the scope of FASB ASC
815, Derivatives and Hedging.   Fair Value of Commodity Derivatives:FASB ASC
815 requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability and be measured at fair
value. Changes in the derivatives fair value are
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge
accounting criteria are met. The Company does not apply hedge
accounting to any of its derivative instruments. The application
of hedge accounting was discontinued by the Company for periods
beginning on or after November3, 2008.   Derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at
fair value on the balance sheet and the associated unrealized
gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in
the income statement. Unrealized gains or losses on commodity
derivatives represent the non-cash change in the fair value of
these derivative instruments and does not impact operating cash
flows on the cash flow statement.   At December31, 2009, the Company had the following open
commodity derivative contracts to manage price risk on a portion
of its natural gas production whereby the Company receives the
fixed price and pays the variable price. See Note8 for the
detail of the asset and liability values of the following
derivatives.

FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENTS   As required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Topic
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, we define fair
value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date and establishes a
three level hierarchy for measuring fair value. Fair value
measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the
following categories   Level1:Quoted prices
unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities that we have the ability to access at the
measurement date.   Level2:Inputs other than quoted
prices included within Level1 that are either directly or
indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices
that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that
are derived from observable market data by correlation or other
means. Instruments categorized in Level2 include
non-exchange traded derivatives such as
over-the-counter
forwards and swaps.   Level3:Unobservable inputs for
the asset or liability, including situations where there is
little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.   The valuation assumptions utilized to measure the fair value of
the Companys commodity derivatives were observable inputs
based on market data obtained from independent sources and are
considered Level2 inputs quoted prices for similar
assets, liabilities adjusted and market-corroborated inputs.   The following table presents for each hierarchy level our assets
and liabilities, including both current and non-current
portions, measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as of
December31, 2009. The company has no derivative
instruments which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   In consideration of counterparty credit risk, the Company
assessed the possibility of whether each counterparty to the
derivative would default by failing to make any contractually
required payments as scheduled in the derivative instrument in
determining the fair value. Additionally, the Company considers
that it is of substantial credit quality and has the financial
resources and willingness to meet its potential repayment
obligations associated with the derivative transactions.   For those non-financial assets and liabilities measured or
disclosed at fair value on a non-recurring basis, primarily our
asset retirement obligation, this respective subtopic of FASB
ASC 820 was effective January1, 2009. Implementation of
this portion of the standard did not have a material impact on
consolidated results of operations, financial position or
liquidity.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   The estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between
willing parties. The carrying amounts reported in the
consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value
due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial
instruments. The carrying amount of floating-rate debt
approximates fair value because the interest rates are variable
and reflective of market rates. We use available market data and
valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt our
fixed rate debt. This disclosure is presented in accordance with
FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, and does not impact
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   In April 2009, the FASB updated the requirements for interim
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments requiring
an entity to provide disclosures about fair value of financial
instruments in interim financial information. The Company is
required to include disclosures about the fair value of its
financial instruments whenever it issues financial information
for interim reporting periods. In addition, the Company is
required to disclose in the body or in the accompanying notes of
its summarized financial information for interim reporting
periods and in its financial statements for annual reporting
periods, the fair value of all financial instruments for which
it is practicable to estimate that value, whether recognized or
not recognized in the statement of financial position. This
updated requirement for interim disclosures about fair value of
financial instruments is effective for periods ending after
June15, 2009 and its adoption had no impact on the
Companys results of operations and financial condition but
requires additional disclosures about the fair value of
financial instruments in the financial statements.

$142million $788million, and $367million,
respectively, attributable to tax deductions associated with the
exercise of stock options. These benefits reduce the amount of
the Companys U.S.federal and state cash tax payments
and are recorded as a reduction of current taxes payable though
not a reduction of the current provision and as an increase in
shareholders equity.   The income tax provision for continuing operations differs from
the amount that would be computed by applying the
U.S.federal income tax rate of 35% to pretax income as a
result of the following   In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which the temporary differences become deductible. Among
other items, management considers the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and
available tax planning strategies.   The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and there
was no effect on our financial condition or results of
operations as a result of implementing the standard related to
accounting for uncertain tax positions. The amount of
unrecognized tax benefits did not change as of December31,
2009.   It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may
change in the next twelve months; however Ultra does not expect
the change to have a significant impact on the results of
operations or the financial position of the Company. The Company
currently has no unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized
would affect the effective tax rate.   The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in
the United States federal jurisdiction and various combined,
consolidated, unitary, and separate filings in several states,
and Canada. With certain exceptions, the Company is no longer
subject to U.S.federal, state and local, or
non-U.S.income
tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2001.   Estimated interest and penalties related to potential
underpayment on any unrecognized tax benefits are classified as
a component of tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. The Company has not recorded any interest or
penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits.   As of December31, 2009, the Company had approximately
$130million of U.S.federal alternative minimum tax
AMT credits available to offset regular U.S.federal
income taxes. These AMT credits do not expire and can be carried
forward indefinitely. In addition, as of December31, 2009,
the Company has $21million of foreign tax credit
carryforwards, none of which expire prior to 2017. However, with
the 2007 sale of Sino American Energy, the Company no longer has
foreign source income for which to utilize its foreign tax
credit carryforwards. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been
placed on the remaining foreign tax credit carryforwards.   The Company has Canadian net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $27million and $23million as of
December31, 2009 and December31, 2008, respectively.
The benefit of the Canadian loss carryforwards can   68 Table of Contents   ULTRA

taxable income in Canada. If not utilized, the Canadian loss
carryforward will expire between 2010 and 2029.   Since the Company currently has no income producing operations
in Canada, management estimates that it is more likely than not
that the Canadian loss carryforwards will not be utilized. A
valuation allowance has been recorded at December31, 2009
and December31, 2008 attributable to this deferred tax
asset.   The undistributed earnings of the Companys
U.S.subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely
invested outside of Canada. Accordingly, no provision for
Canadian income taxes
and/or
withholding taxes has been provided thereon.   The Company periodically uses derivative instruments designated
as cash flow hedges for tax purposes as a method of managing its
exposure to commodity price fluctuations. To the extent these
hedges are effective, changes in the fair value of these
derivative instruments are recorded in Other Comprehensive
Income, net of income tax. To the extent these hedges are
ineffective, they are marked to market with gains and losses
recorded in the statement of operations. At December31,
2008, the Company had open derivative contracts; and, therefore,
recorded a deferred tax liability of $84million,
attributable to unrecognized gains on derivative instruments
which are allocated directly to Other Comprehensive Income. At
December31, 2009 and 2008, the Company also recorded a
deferred tax asset of $276million and a deferred tax
liability of $50million, respectively, attributable to
the unrealized gains recorded in the statement of operations.

EMPLOYEE
BENEFITS   The Company sponsors a qualified, tax-deferred savings plan in
accordance with provisions of Section401k of the
Internal Revenue Code for its employees. Employees may defer up
to 100% of their compensation, subject to certain limitations.
The Company matches the employee contributions up to 5% of
employee compensation along with a profit sharing contribution
of 8%. The expense associated with the Companys
contribution was $11million, $09million and
$09million for the years ended December31, 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES   Transportation contract.In December 2005, the
Company agreed to become an anchor shipper on REX securing
pipeline infrastructure providing sufficient capacity to
transport a portion of its natural gas production away from
southwest Wyoming and to provide for reasonable basis
differentials for its natural gas in the future. REX begins at
the Opal Processing Plant in southwest Wyoming and traverses
Wyoming and several other states to an ultimate terminus in
eastern Ohio. The Companys commitment involves a capacity
of 200MMMBtu per day of natural gas for a term of
10years commencing with initial transportation in January
2008, and the Company is obligated to pay REX certain demand
charges related to its rights to hold this firm transportation
capacity as an anchor shipper. During the first quarter of 2009,
the Company entered into agreements to secure an additional
capacity of 50MMmBtu per day on the REX pipeline system,
beginning in January 2012 through December 2018. This additional
capacity will provide the Company with the ability to move
additional volumes from its producing wells in Wyoming to
markets in the eastern U.S.The Company currently projects
that demand charges related to the remaining term of the
contract will total approximately $7893million.   There have been and will continue to be, numerous other proposed
pipeline projects to transport growing Rockies and Wyoming
natural gas production to a variety of geographically diverse
markets in different parts of North America. Many such proposals
have been presented to the Company in recent months, which, if
constructed, would provide the Company with additional outlets
and market access for its natural gas production from southwest
Wyoming. The Company continuously evaluates such proposals and
may make additional commitments to one or more such pipeline
projects in the future.

2012.   During the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
the Company recognized expense associated with its office leases
in the amount of $09million, $07million, and
$06million, respectively.   Other.The Company is currently involved in
various routine disputes and allegations incidental to its
business operations. While it is not possible to determine the
ultimate disposition of these matters, management, after
consultation with legal counsel, is of the opinion that the
final resolution of all such currently pending or threatened
litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows of the Company.

DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS   During the third quarter of 2007, we made the decision to
dispose of
Sino-American
Energy Corporation
Sino-American,
which owned our Bohai Bay assets in China, in order to focus on
our legacy asset in the Pinedale Field in southwest Wyoming. The
reserve volumes sold represent all of Ultras international
assets and, previously, were the only results included in our
foreign operating segment.   The Company accounted for its
Sino-American
operations as discontinued operations and reclassified prior
period financial statements to exclude these businesses from
continuing operations. A summary of financial information
related to the Companys discontinued operations is as

CREDIT
RISK   The Companys revenues are derived principally from
uncollateralized sales to customers in the natural gas and oil
industry. The concentration of credit risk in a single industry
affects the Companys overall exposure to credit risk
because customers may be similarly affected by changes in
economic and other conditions. The Company performs a credit
analysis of customers prior to making any sales to new customers
or increasing extension of credit for existing customers. Based
upon this credit analysis, the Company may require a standby
letter of credit or a financial guarantee.   
70 Table of Contents   ULTRA
PETROLEUM CORP.
NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade
receivables and commodity derivative contracts associated with
the Companys hedging program. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to receivables are limited due to its large
number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas.   A significant counterparty is defined as one that individually
accounts for 10% or more of the Companys total revenues
during the year. In 2009, the Company had three significant
counterparties associated with sales of its natural gas
production and commodity derivatives contracts. Sales and
settlements of derivative contracts to Sempra Energy Trading
Corp., J Aron Company and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.
were $1449million, $1013million, and
$971million, respectively, which accounted for 162   113% and 108% of the Companys total 2009 revenues
including realized gains on commodity derivatives,
respectively. At December31, 2009, the Company had
outstanding receivables which were received in full in January
2010from Sempra Energy Trading Corp., J Aron
Company and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. totaling
$197million.

SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS   FASB ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events FASB ASC
855, sets forth principles and requirements to be applied
to the accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events. FASB
ASC 855 sets forth the period after the balance sheet date
during which management shall evaluate events or transactions
that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements, the circumstances under which events or
transactions occurring after the balance sheet date shall be
recognized in the financial statements and the required
disclosures about events or transactions that occurred after the
balance sheet date. The FASB issued ASU
No2010-09,
Subsequent Events FASB ASC 855, Amendments to Certain
Recognition and Disclosure Requirements, on
February24, 2010, in an effort to remove some
contradictions between the requirements of U.S.GAAP and
the SECs filing rules. The amendments remove the
requirement that public companies disclose the date of their
financial statements in both issued and revised financial
statements. The Company has evaluated the period subsequent to
December31, 2009 for events that did not exist at the
balance sheet date but arose after that date and determined that
the subsequent events described below should be disclosed in
order to keep the financial statements from being misleading.   On December21, 2009, the Company announced that it had
signed a purchase and sale agreement, subject to due diligence,
to acquire additional acreage in the Pennsylvania Marcellus
Shale in order to increase the scale of its Marcellus position.
In connection with the purchase in Pennsylvania, the Company
placed $250million in an escrow account, which is
reflected as non-current restricted cash on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets at December31, 2009. The Company closed
this acquisition on February22, 2010. At the closing, the
Company acquired 78,221net acres in the deep rights, for a
purchase price of $3330million, subject to post closing
adjustments. The Company may acquire additional interests in
these net acres at subsequent closings if the Sellers cure title
defects as provided in the purchase agreement.   On January28, 2010, the Companys subsidiary, Ultra
Resources, Inc., agreed to issue an aggregate amount of
$5000million of Senior Notes the 2010 Senior
Notes pursuant to a Second Supplement to its Master Note
Purchase Agreement dated March6, 2008. Of the 2010 Senior
Notes: $2700million of the 2010 Senior Notes were issued
January28, 2010 and $2300million of the 2010 Senior
Notes were issued February16, 2010. The 2010 Senior Notes
rank pari passu with Ultra Resources bank revolving credit
facility and other outstanding Senior Notes. Payment of the 2010
Senior Notes is guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiary, UP
Energy Corporation. Proceeds from the 2010 Senior Notes were
used to repay revolving credit facility debt, but did not reduce
the borrowings available under the revolving credit facility,
and for general corporate purposes, including funding the
Pennsylvania Marcellus Shale acquisition that closed on
February22, 2010. Of the 2010 Senior Notes,
$1160million are 498%senior notes due in 2017,

DISCLOSURE
ABOUT OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES UNAUDITED   The following information about the Companys oil and
natural gas producing activities is presented in accordance with
FASB ASC Topic 932, Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and
Disclosures   
A.
OIL
AND GAS RESERVES   On January6, 2010, the FASB issued an ASU updating oil and
gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements. The ASU
amends FASB ASC 932 to align the reserve calculation and
disclosure requirements with the requirements in SEC Release
No33-8995.
The ASU is effective for reporting periods ending on or after
December31, 2009.   On December31, 2008, the SEC issued SEC Release
No33-8995,
amending oil and gas reporting requirements under
Rule4-10
of
RegulationS-X
and Industry Guide 2 in
RegulationS-K
revising oil and gas reserves estimation and disclosure
requirements. The new rules include changes to pricing used to
estimate reserves, the ability to include non-traditional
resources in reserves, the use of new technology for determining
reserves and permitting disclosure of probable and possible
reserves. The primary objectives of the revisions are to
increase the transparency and information value of reserve
disclosures and improve comparability among oil and gas
companies. The rule is effective for annual reports on
Form10-K
for fiscal years ending on or after December31, 2009.
Accordingly, the Company adopted the update to FASB ASC 932 as
of December31, 2009 in order to conform to the
requirements in SEC Release
No33-8995.
The implementation of this rule did not result in material
additions to the Companys proved reserves included in this
report as of December31, 2009.   In accordance with our three-year planning and budgeting cycle,
proved undeveloped reserves included in the current, as well as
previous, reserve estimates include only economic well locations
that are forecast to be drilled within a three-year period. As a
result of our self-imposed three-year limit on proved
undeveloped reserves inventory, we have not booked any proved
undeveloped reserves beyond five years.   The determination of oil and natural gas reserves is complex and
highly interpretive. Assumptions used to estimate reserve
information may significantly increase or decrease such reserves
in future periods. The estimates   73 Table of Contents   ULTRA

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   of reserves are subject to continuing changes and, therefore, an
accurate determination of reserves may not be possible for many
years because of the time needed for development, drilling,
testing, and studies of reservoirs.   The Director Reservoir Engineering
Planning is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation
of the Companys reserve estimates by our independent
engineers, Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. The
Director has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum
Engineering and is a licensed Professional Engineer. The
Companys internal controls over reserve estimates include
reconciliation and review controls, including an independent
internal review of assumptions used in the estimation.   All of the information regarding reserves in this annual report
is derived from the report of Netherland, Sewell
Associates, Inc. The report of Netherland, Sewell
Associates, Inc. is included as an Exhibit to this annual
report. The principal engineer at Netherland, Sewell
Associates, Inc. responsible for preparing our reserve estimates
has a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering and
is a licensed Professional Engineer with over 25years of
experience, including significant experience throughout the
Rocky Mountain basins.   The following unaudited tables as of December31, 2009,
2008, 2007 and 2006 are based upon estimates prepared by
Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. and estimates
prepared by Ryder Scott Company as of December31, 2006.
The estimates for properties in the United States were prepared
by Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. in reports
dated January27, 2010, February6, 2009,and
February4, 2008, respectively. The estimates for
properties in China were prepared by Ryder Scott Company in a
report dated January, 30, 2007. These are estimated quantities
of proved oil and natural gas reserves for the Company and the
changes in total proved reserves as of December31, 2009,
2008 and 2007. All such reserves are located in the Green River
Basin in Wyoming and the Appalachian Basin of Pennsylvania.   Since January1, 2009, no crude oil or natural gas reserve
information has been filed with, or included in any report to,
any federal authority or agency other than the SEC and the
Energy Information Administration EIA of the
U.S.Department of Energy. We file Form23, including
reserve and other information, with the EIA.

and 2007, respectively, utilizing prices in effect on the last
day of the year. The calculated weighted average oil price at
December31, 2008 and 2007 for Wyoming was $3010 per
barrel and $8691, respectively, utilizing prices in effect on
the last day of the year.   The future production and development costs represent the
estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and
producing the proved reserves, assuming continuation of existing
economic conditions. Future income tax expense was computed by
applying statutory income tax rates to the difference between
pretax net cash flows relating to the Companys proved
reserves and the tax basis of proved properties and available

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Company. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth
herein represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a
subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of
oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way and
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the
quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different
engineers often vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing
and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify
revision of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates are
often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that
are ultimately recovered. Further, the estimated future net
revenues from proved reserves and the present value thereof are
based upon certain assumptions, including geologic success,
prices, future production levels and costs that may not prove
correct over time. Predictions of future production levels are
subject to great uncertainty, and the meaningfulness of such
estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the
assumptions upon which they are based. Historically, oil and
natural gas prices have fluctuated widely.

Reporting   Managements Report on Assessment of Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting is included on page46 of this
form10-K.   Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2009 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   Evaluation
of Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
under
Rule13a-15e
and
Rule15d-15e
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation,
our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of December31, 2009. The evaluation
considered the procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted
by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs
rules and forms and communicated to our management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
