Item5. Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule13a-15e promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our
principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 51 Table of Contents   
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company          
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and
iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2004. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal Control -
Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment and those criteria, management believes that, as of December31,
2004, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. The Companys
independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young
LLP, has issued an
attestation report on managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. That report begins on page F-3. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or a likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. Item9B. Other Information None. PART III
