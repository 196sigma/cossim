Item5.Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the SEC reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified by the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of December 31, 2010, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer participated with management in evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act. Our Chief Executive Offic
er and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below. Managements report on internal control over financial reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a public companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company, ii provide reasonable assurance that tra
nsactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company, and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Our management previously concluded that we did not maintain effective controls over accounting for income taxes with respect to non-routine and atypical transactions as of December 31, 2009.During 2010, we noted the previously reported control deficiency surrounding our income tax provision was not isolated solely to non-routine and atypical transactions but more broadly affects the completeness and accuracy of our world-wide provision for income taxes.Accordingly, our management concluded we did not maintain effective control over accounting for income taxes as of December 31, 2010. Specifically, our internal control to review our tax returns and return to provision calculations and  32 Table of Contents analysis was not operating with the level of rigor and precision necessary to ensure the accounting for our income tax provision and deferred tax balances was being completely and accurately recorded on a timely basis. This control deficiency resulted in the identification of several immaterial errors impacting the income tax provision and deferred tax balances related to prior period financial statements. Although these errors did not result in the restatement of our previously filed consolidated financial statements, this control deficiency could result in the misstatement of income tax accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.Accordingly, our management has determined the previously reported control deficiency 
continues to exist, although it more broadly affects our income tax provision and disclosures, and therefore this control deficiency continues to constitute a material weakness as of December 31, 2010. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of this material weakness, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2010 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Remediation plan Our management continues to take action in remediating the material weakness identified by thoroughly reviewing the tax provision process and existing controls to identify areas in need of improvement to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls over the accounting for income taxes.Specifically, management believes the recent personnel changes in our tax department in 2010 and their timely and diligent execution of existing controls related to the preparation and review of our local country tax accrual, tax returns and return to provision calculations and analysis should remediate the existing material weakness.
