Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors of Coventry
Health Care, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years
then ended. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a.
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. The financial statements
and schedule of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2001 were
audited by other auditors who have ceased operations and whose report dated February 1, 2002 expressed
an unqualified opinion on those statements and schedule before the restatement disclosures described
in Note C. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Coventry
Health Care, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note C to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, Coventry Health Care, Inc., changed its method of accounting
for goodwill and other intangible assets. As discussed above, the consolidated financial
statements of Coventry Health Care, Inc. as of December 31, 2001, and for the year ended December 31 2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note C, these consolidated
financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was
adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. Our audit procedures with respect to the disclosures in
Note C with respect to 2001 included a agreeing the previously reported net earnings to the previously
issued financial statements and the adjustments to reported net earnings representing amortization expense
recognized in those periods related to goodwill to the Companys underlying records obtained from management and b testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net earnings to reported
net earnings, and the related earnings-per-share amounts. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 in
Note C are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the
2001 financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole. ERNST YOUNG LLP Baltimore, MarylandJanuary

2003 Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are 100 owned. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
amounts. Reclassifications Certain 2002 and 2001
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation. Stock Split On December 23, 2003, the
Companys Board of Directors approved a threefortwo stock split of the Companys common stock. The
stock split, in the form of a stock dividend, was distributed January 30, 2004 for stockholders of record
on January 9, 2004. The stock split is reflected retroactively in the Companys consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto for all periods presented. 
48 Table of Contents Significant Customers The Companys commercial
business is diversified across a large customer base and there are no commercial groups that make up
10% or more of managed care premiums. For the years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company received
108%, 123% and 114%, respectively, of its managed care premiums from the Federal Medicare+Choice
program throughout its various markets. The Company also received 118%, 131% and 124% of its managed
care premiums in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, from its state-sponsored Medicaid programs throughout
its various markets. In 2003, the State of Missouri accounted for over half of the Companys Medicaid
membership. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash
equivalents consist principally of money market funds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit.
The Company considers all highly liquid securities purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents reported in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value. Investments The Company accounts for investments
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115 Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB.
The Company invests primarily in fixed income securities and classifies all its investments as available-for-sale.
Investments are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other-than-temporary.
In making that determination, the Company considers all available evidence relating to the realizable
value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables;
the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less
than cost; 
the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer;
the Companys intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period
of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value;
elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; 
rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and 
expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments
classified as available-for-sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a
separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged
to be other-than-temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings.
Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis.
Investments with original maturities in
excess of three months and less than one year are classified as short-term investments and generally
consist of corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury notes and commercial paper. Long-term investments have original
maturities in excess of one year and primarily consist of fixed income securities. Derivative Investment In June 1998, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Effective
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133. Accordingly, a transition gain of $09 million, net
of tax, was recorded in the first quarter of 2001 related to one financial investment classified as
derivative in nature. The adjustment is shown separately as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. The derivative investment was sold during the second quarter of 2003 and a gain of $08 million
was recorded as other income, net in the consolidated financial statements. Other Receivables Other receivables include
interest receivables, reinsurance claims receivables, receivables from providers and suppliers and any
other receivables that do not relate to premiums. Property and Equipment Property, equipment
and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated lives of the related assets or, if shorter, over the terms of the respective leases.
Long-term Assets Long-term assets include
primarily assets associated with the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP 
and the deferred tax assets. Business Combinations, Accounting for Goodwill
and Other Intangibles In June 2001, the FASB issued two standards related to business combinations.
The first statement, SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations, requires all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method and prohibits the pooling-of-interest
method of accounting. SFAS No. 141 also states that acquired intangible assets should be separately
recognized upon meeting certain criteria. Such intangible assets include, but are not limited to, trade
and service marks, non-compete agreements, customer lists and licenses. The Company was not significantly
affected by the implementation of this statement. 
49 Table of Contents The second statement, SFAS No. 142 Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, requires companies to cease amortization of goodwill. Rather, goodwill
and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives will be subject to a periodic assessment for
impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. The Company uses three approaches to identifying the
fair value of its goodwill and other intangible assets: the market approach, the market capitalization
approach and the income approach. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by analyzing
the recent sales of similar companies. The market capitalization approach is based on market value of
the Companys total shares outstanding. The income approach is based on the present value of expected
future cash flows. As, impairment charges occur, write-downs charges will be recorded in the
period in which the impairment took place. As required, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 for the fiscal
year beginning January 1, 2002, and, accordingly, goodwill was not amortized during 2002 nor 2003. See
Note C to consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to intangible assets. Medical Claims Liabilities and Expense 
Medical claims liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care
services incurred but not reported. The estimated claims incurred but not reported are based on historical
data, current enrollment, health service utilization statistics and other related information. In determining
IBNR liabilities, the Company employs standard actuarial reserve methods that are specific to each markets
membership, product characteristics, geographic territories and provider network. The Company also considers
utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and other medical expenses as well as claim payment backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements. The Company also establishes
reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance
costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance
recoveries on those contracts. These accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements
are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions
for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the
near term. The following table shows the components
of the change in medical liabilities Medical claims liabilities and Other medical liabilities
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively  2003 2002 2001 Medical liabilities, Beginning of Period

$558,599
$522,854 Acquisition balances
represent medical liabilities as of the applicable acquisition date.
Subsequent changes in estimates related to the acquired balances are recorded as
adjustments to the settlement account with the acquired entitys previous
owner.
The negative
amounts noted as prior year medical costs are favorable
adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated.
As noted above, these favorable restatements from original estimates occur due
to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of
medical cost trends. The Company believes that the amount of
medical liabilities is adequate to cover its ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of December 31 2003; however, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. Assuming
a hypothetical 1% variance between the December 31, 2003 estimates of medical liabilities and actual
costs payable, net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003, would increase or decrease by approximately
$38 million and diluted earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately $004 per share.

Liabilities consist primarily of liabilities associated with the SERP and the deferred tax liability
associated with the net unrealized gains on investments. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums
are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on
a per subscriber contract rate and the subscribers in the Companys records at the time of billing.
Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium
billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations additions, or other changes. The Company also receives premium payments from the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services CMS on a monthly basis for its Medicare+Choice membership. Membership and
category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and could result in adjustments to revenue.
Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Employer contracts are typically on
an annual basis, subject to cancellation by the employer group or by the Company upon 30 days notice.
Based on information received subsequent
to premium billings being sent, historical trends, bad debt write-offs and the collectibility of specific
accounts, the Company estimates, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future retroactivity
and adjusts its revenue and reserves accordingly. Premiums for services to federal employee
groups are subject to audit and review by the Office of Personnel Management OPM on a periodic basis.
Such audits are usually a number of years in arrears. Adjustments are recorded as additional information regarding
the audits and reviews becomes available. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded
in the year the audits are finalized. The Company currently enters into performance
guarantees with employer groups where the Company guarantees that it will meet certain
standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims
processing, claims accuracy and telephone on-hold time. Under these performance guarantees, the Company
could be at risk for not maintaining the standards agreed upon in the contracts. The risk level varies
by agreement with penalties based on a variety of calculations including per member per month, percentage
of premium, or percentage of administration fees. Performance levels are evaluated at least quarterly.
The Company estimates its potential exposure and records the appropriate reserves. The penalties that
the Company have incurred have been immaterial and, although, the Company can not predict with precision
the future effect on its results of operations of these penalties, the Company expects them
to remain immaterial.  51 Table of Contents Stock-based Compensation The Company accounts
for stock-based compensation to employees under Accounting Principles Board APB No. 25 Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and complies with the disclosure requirements for SFAS No. 123 Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation and SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition
and Disclosure. Unless the accounting rules change, the Company does not expect to transition to the
fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. Had compensation cost for these plans
been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Companys net earnings and earnings per share EPS
would have been reduced to the following pro-forma amounts in thousands, except per share data: Years Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001  Net earnings, as reported

federal tax return for the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined
by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and
liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date. See Note F to consolidated financial statements for disclosures related
to income taxes. 52 Table of Contents B. ACQUISITIONS During the three years ended December 31 2003, the Company completed several business combinations and membership purchases. The Companys business
combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and, accordingly, the operating
results of each acquisition have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since
their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated
to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair
values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to
goodwill. Through December 31, 2001, goodwill was amortized over a useful life of 35 years. In accordance
with SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill. The purchase
price of the Companys membership purchases is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being
amortized over a useful life of five to twenty years. The following table summarizes all business
combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended December 31, 2003. The purchase price in thousands, of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and transition costs.
Transition costs are initial estimates of future expenses based on historical experience and known costs.
These estimates may be adjusted as actual expenses are incurred in effect modifying the final purchase
price of the acquisition. In addition, the Companys acquisition agreements contain a provision for
a final retroactive balance sheet settlement after the effective date of the acquisition which may result
in adjustments to the purchase price. The purchase price, in thousands, is inclusive of all retroactive
balance sheet settlements to date and transaction cost adjustments. Effective Date Market PurchasePrice Business Combinations Blue Ridge Health Alliance, Inc. Blue Ridge

industries or sectors and the Company intends to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient
to allow for a recovery in market value. F. INCOME TAXES 
At December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $63 million of federal and $151 million
of state tax net operating loss carryforwards. The net operating losses were primarily acquired through
various acquisitions. The net operating loss carryforwards can be used to reduce future taxable income
until they expire through the year 2021. The provision for income taxes consists

options being equal to not less than 100% of the fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant.
Options generally become exercisable after one year in 25% increments per year and expire ten years
from the date of grant. At December 31, 2003, the Stock Incentive Plan had outstanding options representing
54 million shares of common stock.

shares of restricted stock with varying vesting periods through 2007. The fair value of the restricted
shares, at the grant date, is amortized over the vesting period. The restricted stock shares were granted

year, the Company issues the stock to participating employees at an issue price equal to 85% of the
lower of the stock price at the end of the plan year or the average stock price, as defined. The Company
has reserved 14 million shares of stock for this plan and has issued 25,696, 16,495 and 13,912 shares

contributions, of the Savings Plan and the SERP charged to operations for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $73
million, $54 million and $56 million, respectively. 
61 Table of Contents H. SENIOR NOTES On February 1, 2002, the Company completed
a transaction to sell $1750 million original 8125% senior notes due February 15, 2012 in a private
placement. These senior notes were then registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
proceeds from the sale of senior notes were used to purchase, from Principal Health Care, Inc., 71
million shares of Coventry common stock and a warrant exercisable, at that time, for 31 million shares
of Coventry common stock. The aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and the warrant
was $1761 million. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 each year. In August 2003, the Company repurchased
a portion of its senior notes with a face value of $45 million and a weighted average premium of 89%.
The Company recorded a loss on the repurchase in accordance with SFAS No. 145 which requires gains and
losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations. The
loss of $05 million was included as additional senior notes interest expense. The carrying value
of the senior notes is equal to the face value and the fair value is based on the quoted market prices.
As of December 31, 2003, the carrying value was $1705 million and the fair value was $1897 million.
As of December 31, 2002, the carrying value was $1750 million and the fair value was $1820 million. The senior notes contain certain covenants
and restrictions regarding incurring additional debt, limiting dividends or other restricted payments and restricting transactions with affiliates, sales of assets and consolidations or mergers. The Company
has complied with all covenants under the senior notes. I. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is contractually obligated to

$234,972 Leases The Company operates primarily in leased
facilities with original lease terms of up to ten years with options for renewal. Through its acquisitions the Company has office equipment leases with terms of approximately three years. Total rent expense was $174 million, $152
million and $153 million, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, the Company
has been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied
by the Company, medical malpractice actions, employment related claims and other various claims seeking
monetary damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought
to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2003 may result in the assertion of additional claims.
The Company carries general liability insurance for each of the Companys operations on a claims-made
basis with varying deductibles for which the Company maintains reserves. The Company maintains general
liability, professional liability and employment practices liability insurance in amounts that the Company
believes is appropriate. The professional liability and employment practices liability insurances are
carried through the Companys captive subsidiary. 
62 Table of Contents The Companys captive subsidiary provides
up to $5 million in professional liability coverage for each single claim and up to $10 million in coverage
for each class action claim. The captive professional liability policy has an aggregate limit of $20
million per year. The captive is also co-insured with a commercial carrier for an additional $10 million
for professional liability claims. Additionally, the captive employment practices liability policy provides
up to $250,000 per single claim, $10 million per class action claim, and an aggregate policy limit of
$10 million. Each year the Company will re-evaluate the most cost effective method for insuring these
types of claims. Coventry Health Care, Inc. is a defendant
in the provider track in the Managed Care Litigation filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, MDL No. 1334, styled in re: Humana, Inc., Charles B. Shane MD, et al. vs. Humana, Inc., et al. This action was filed by a group of physicians as a class action
against Coventry and twelve other companies in the managed care industry. In its fourth amended complaint the plaintiffs have alleged violations of the federal racketeering act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations RICO, conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate RICO.
In addition to these RICO claims, the complaint includes counts for breach of contract, violations of
various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. Coventry
has filed a motion to dismiss each of these claims because they fail to state a cause of action or in the alternative, to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions which exist in the
Companys physician contracts. In response to the motion to dismiss, the trial court dismissed several
of the claims and ordered that all physicians who have an arbitration provision in their provider contracts
must submit all of their claims to arbitration. As a consequence of this ruling, all the plaintiffs
who have arbitration provisions voluntarily dismissed all of their arbitratable claims. The trial court
excluded from the scope of claims subject to arbitration, the plaintiffs claims of conspiracy, conspiracy
to violate RICO and aiding and abetting violations of RICO. The defendants, including Coventry, have
appealed the trial courts decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal has been fully
briefed and the parties are awaiting a date for oral argument. The trial court has certified various
subclasses of physicians; however, Coventry is not subject to the class certification order because
the motion to certify was filed before Coventry was joined as a defendant. The plaintiffs have now filed
a motion to certify a class as to Coventry, and Coventry has filed their opposition to that motion.
The trial court has not yet issued a ruling on the motion. The defendants who were subject to the certification
order filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit which has been argued. The appeals court has not yet issued
its decision. Subsequent to this appeal, two companies have entered into settlement agreements with
the plaintiffs. Both settlement agreements have been filed with the Court and
have received final approval. Although the Company can not predict the outcome, management believes that this lawsuit will not have a material
adverse effect on its financial position or our results of operations. Management also believes that
the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit, and the Company intends to defend its position. The Company may be the target of other similar
lawsuits involving RICO and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, generally claiming that managed
care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care. Although
the Company may be the target of other similar lawsuits, the Company believes there is no valid basis
for such lawsuits. The Companys industry is heavily regulated
and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject
to frequent change. Existing or future laws could have a significant effect on the Companys operations.
Capitation Arrangements A small percentage of the Companys membership
is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a
fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the globally capitated members.
Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing
and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit the Companys exposure to the
risk of increasing medical costs, but expose the Company to risk as to the adequacy of the financial
and medical care resources of the provider organization. In addition to global capitation arrangements the Company has capitation arrangements for ancillary services, such as mental health care. The Company
is responsible for the coverage of its members pursuant to its customer agreements. To the extent that
the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform
its obligations under the capitation arrangements, the Company will be required to perform such obligations.
Consequently, the Company may have to incur costs in excess of the amounts it would otherwise have to pay under
the original global or ancillary capitation arrangements. Medical costs associated with capitation arrangements
made up approximately 99%, 89%, and 88% of the Companys total medical costs for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Membership associated with global capitation arrangements
was approximately 145,000, 116,000 and 84,000 as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program 63 Table of Contents The Company contracts with the Office of
Personnel Management OPM to provide managed health care services under the Federal Employee Health
Benefits Program FEHBP. These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish
premium rating arrangements for this program. The OPM conducts periodic audits of its contractors to among other things, verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with
the community rating and other requirements under FEHBP. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute
other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program. HealthAmerica Pennsylvania, Inc. HealthAmerica the Companys Pennsylvania HMO subsidiary, received audit reports from the OPM that questioned approximately
$311 million of subscription charges that were paid to HealthAmerica under the FEHBP for contract years
1993 1999. In the fourth quarter of 2003, HealthAmerica, settled this dispute with the OPM and the
U.S. Department of Justice. The final settlement payment of $290 million was fully reserved by HealthAmerica
and therefore had no impact on 2003 earnings, the regulated capital of HealthAmerica, or the Companys
consolidated stockholders equity. J. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Companys financial instruments that
are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments in fixed income securities
and accounts receivable. The Company invests its excess cash in state and municipal bonds, U.S. Treasury
and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt and other
securities. Investments in marketable securities are managed within guidelines established by the Board
of Directors, which require investment-grade fixed income securities and limit the amount that may be
invested in any one issuer. The fair value of the Companys financial instruments is equivalent to their
carrying value and, although there is some credit risk associated with these instruments, the Company
believes this risk to be minimal. Concentration of credit risk with respect
to receivables is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer base
and their breakdown among geographical locations. The Company believes the allowance for doubtful accounts
adequately provides for estimated losses as of December 31, 2003. The Company has a risk of incurring
losses if such allowances are not adequate. K. STATUTORY INFORMATION The Companys HMO and insurance company
subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby
limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its regulated entities. During 2003, the Company
collected $1087 million in dividends from its regulated subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
NAIC has proposed that states adopt risk-based capital RBC standards that, if adopted, would
generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other risk-bearing health
care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital deemed appropriate for a managed
care organization to support its overall business operations with consideration for its size and risk
profile. This calculation, approved by the NAIC, incorporates asset risk, underwriting risk, credit
risk and business risk components. The Companys health plans are required to submit an RBC report to
the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. The RBC results will then be used to determine
if the health plans statutory net worth is adequate to support the amount of its calculated risk profile.
Regulators will also use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory
actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the
plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under
regulatory control. 
64 Table of Contents The majority of states in which the Company
operates health plans have adopted an RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory
reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC.
The Company has adopted an internal policy to maintain all of its regulated subsidiaries
statutory reserves at or above 250% of their RBC. Some states in which the Companys regulated subsidiaries
operate, require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The
table below summarizes the Companys statutory reserve information, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002
in millions except percentage data. 2003 2002 Capital and surplus

195 The increase in capital and surplus for
the Companys regulated subsidiaries is a result of income during 2003 and the acquisitions of PersonalCare and Altius,
offset by dividends paid to the
parent company. The increase in statutory deposits is mainly a result of the acquisitions of PersonalCare
and Altius. Excluding funds held by entities subject
to regulation, the Company had cash and investments of approximately $2095 million and $867 million
at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The increase in non-regulated cash and investments
is primarily a result of dividends received from subsidiaries mentioned above and ordinary operating
activities offset by payments for acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Coventry made
capital contributions of approximately $141 million to the Companys HMO subsidiaries. This contribution
was almost exclusively made to the Companys recently acquired Altius Health Plan in order to increase
capital to appropriate levels. L. OTHER INCOME Other income for the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 includes investment income, net of fees, of approximately $402 million, $409
million and $432 million, respectively. 
65 Table of Contents M. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share assume
the exercise of all options and warrants and the vesting of all restricted stock using the treasury
stock method. The following table summarizes the earnings

a program to repurchase up to 10% of its outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from
time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions.
As a part of this program, the Company purchased 56 million shares of its common stock from 1999 to 2002,
which includes 33 million purchased in 2002 at an
aggregate cost of $655 million. The Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock in 2003
under this program. The total remaining common shares the Company are authorized to repurchase under
the program, including the new authorization, is approximately 38 million as of December 31, 2003. O. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company has three reportable segments Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products. The products are provided to a cross section of employer
groups and individuals throughout the Companys health plans. Commercial products include HMO, PPO and
POS products. HMO products provide comprehensive health care benefits to members through a primary care
physician. PPO and POS products permit members to participate in managed care but allow them the flexibility
to utilize out-of-network providers in exchange for increased out-of-pocket costs. The Company provides
comprehensive health benefits to members participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs and receives
premium payments from federal and state governments. The Company evaluates the performance of
its operating segments and allocates resources based on gross margin. Assets are not allocated to specific
products and, accordingly, can not be reported by segment. The following tables summarize the Companys
reportable segments through gross margin and include a medical loss ratio MLR calculation: Years Ended December 31,in thousands Commercial Medicare Medicaid Total 2003 Revenues

045 Q. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS UNAUDITED On January 14, 2004, the Company announced
that its Illinois subsidiary, PersonalCare Health Management, Inc. PersonalCare, had entered into
a renewal rights agreement with Rockford Health Systems whereby PersonalCare will serve as the carrier
of choice for the transition of Rockford Health Plans business. Rockford Health Plans, a forprofit
plan wholly owned by Rockford Health Systems, covers a sevencounty service area and provides health
benefits to approximately 14,000 fully insured commercial members and 6,000 fullservice self insured
members. Under the terms of the agreement, Rockford Health Systems providers will become participating
providers in PersonalCares network. The agreement expected to commence upon final regulatory approvals.
Between January 1, 2004,
and the date of this filing, under the share repurchase program previously
approved by the Board of Directors, the Company purchased 20 million shares of
its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $846 million. The remaining
common shares the Company is authorized to repurchase under the program is
approximately 18 million.
