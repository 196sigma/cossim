MONSTER WORLDWIDE,INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts    
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Monster
Worldwide,Inc. the Company has continuing operations that consist of two operating segments: Monster and Advertising Communications. Revenue in the Company Monster
segment is primarily earned from job postings placed on the Company career websites; licensed access to the Company resume database; and the display of advertising on the Company online
properties. Revenue in the Company Advertising Communications division is primarily earned from selling and placing recruitment advertising, in print and online media, resume screening
services and other recruitment related products. These services are provided to customers in a variety of industries throughout North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. 
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. These estimates include, among others, allowances for doubtful accounts, net realizable values on long-lived assets and deferred tax assets, certain accrued expense accounts and
revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Certain
reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made for consistent presentation. 
Business Combinations and Dispositions 
The purchase method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Therefore, the
consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an acquisition and are not restated. The costs to acquire a business, including
transaction costs, are allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired upon acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as
goodwill. 
For
the period January1, 2004 through December31, 2005, the Company completed six business combinations. There were no significant business acquisitions during the year ended
December31, 2003. Note2 to the financial statements contains a full discussion of the Company business combinations occurring in the 2004 and 2005 periods. Although none of the
following acquisitions were considered to be significant subsidiaries, either individually or in the aggregate, they do affect the comparability of results from period to period. The acquisitions and
the acquisition dates are as follows: Acquired Business

The
Company accounts for business dispositions in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS144 requires the results of operations of business dispositions to be segregated from continuing operations and reflected as
discontinued operations in current and prior periods. The results of the Company continuing operations have been restated to reflect such dispositions in each period presented. See Note3 to
the financial statements for further discussion of the Company disposition transactions. 
Revenue Recognition 
Monster. Our Monster division primarily earns revenue from the placement of job postings on the websites within the Monster network, access to the
Monster network online resume database and other ancillary services. We recognize revenue at the time that job postings are displayed on the Monster network websites. Revenue earned from
subscriptions to the Monster network resume database is recognized over the length of the underlying subscriptions, typically from two weeks to twelve months. Revenue associated with multiple
element contracts is allocated based on the relative fair value of the services included in the contract. Unearned revenues are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue. 
Advertising Communications.Our Advertising Communications division derives revenue from job advertisements placed in
newspapers, Internet career job boards such as Monster and other media, plus associated fees for related services. Revenue is recorded net of media placement costs, which are passed on to the
customer. Revenue is generally recognized upon placement date for newspapers and other print and offline media. Online media revenue is recognized when services are purchased. 
Marketing and Promotion 
Advertising production costs are recorded as expense the first time an advertisement appears. Costs of communicating advertising are recorded as expense as advertising space or
airtime is used. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for long-term debt
approximates fair value because, in general, the interest on the underlying instruments fluctuates with market rates. In instances where long-term debt carries fixed interest rates, the
obligation is recorded at the present value of the future payments, which approximates fair value. 
Concentrations of Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts
receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these
deposits may be redeemed upon demand. The Company also invests in short-term commercial paper rated P1 by Moody or A1 by Standard Poors or better. As of December31, 2005
the Company held available-for-sale investments with a fair value 
43  of
$1237million. These investments are subject to fluctuations based on changes in interest rates and market prices. 
The
Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers, maintains allowances for potential credit losses and does not require collateral. The Company makes judgments as to its ability to
collect outstanding receivables based primarily on management evaluation of the customer financial condition, past collection history and overall aging of the receivables. Historically, such
losses
have been within management expectations. The Company has not experienced significant losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or
geographic area. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
Cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of money market funds and commercial paper, are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. For financial statement
presentation purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments having original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Outstanding checks in excess of account balances,
typically publisher payments, payroll and other contractual obligations disbursed on or near the last day of a reporting period are reported as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. 
The
Company marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale investments and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss. Realized gains or losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary, if any, are reported in other income, net. The Company evaluates its investments
periodically for possible impairment and reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis and the Company ability and intent to hold the investment
for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. Marketable securities as of December31, 2005 consisted of auction rate bonds and bank time deposits with
original maturities greater than ninety days. 
Accounts Receivable 
The Company accounts receivable primarily consist of trade receivables. Management reviews accounts receivable on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will
potentially be uncollectible. The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible, in its allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a
receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, the Company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts as of December31, 2005
is adequate. However, actual write-offs could exceed the recorded allowance. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows: Year ended December 31,

Property and Equipment 
Computer and communications equipment, furniture and fixtures and capitalized software costs are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 3 to 10years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized, using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful
lives, or the lease term, whichever is shorter. 
Capitalized Software Costs 
Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software for internal use. The Company capitalizes certain incurred software development costs in accordance
with, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA issued Statement of Position No98-1, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1. Costs incurred during the application-development stage for software bought and further customized by outside
vendors for the Company use and software developed by a vendor for the Company proprietary use have been capitalized. Costs incurred related to the Company own personnel who are directly
associated with software development are capitalized as appropriate. 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. The company
performs an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired.
The impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a
significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of the Company reporting units. Changes in the Company strategy and/or market conditions could
significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets. 
Other
intangible assets primarily consist of the value of customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trademarks and internet domains. Amortizable intangible assets are primarily being
amortized on a basis that approximates economic use, over periods ranging from two to thirty years. 
Long-Lived Assets 
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets
may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and its eventual disposition is less
than its carrying amount. Intangible assets are primarily evaluated on an annual basis, generally in conjunction with the Company evaluation of goodwill balances. Impairment, if any, is assessed by
using internally developed discounted cash flows estimates, quoted market prices, when available, and independent appraisals to determine fair value. The determination of whether or not
long-lived assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the estimated future cash flows expected to
result from the use of those assets. Changes in the Company 
45  strategy,
assumptions and/or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of long-lived assets. 
On
March31, 2003, the Company completed a distribution of the common stock of Hudson Highland Group,Inc. HH Group as a tax-free dividend to its shareholders the
spin-off. Prior to the distribution, HH Group was reported as the Company eResourcing and Executive Search segments. During the year ended December31, 2003, the Company
recorded a $25,783 impairment charge as a component of business reorganization, spin-off and other special charges, mainly relating to software that was abandoned as a direct result of the
spin-off transaction. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The financial position and results of operations of the Company foreign subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of
these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year.
Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in other comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses
resulting from other foreign currency transactions are included in other income, net. 
Comprehensive
income loss is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company items of other comprehensive income
loss are foreign currency translation adjustments, which relate to investments that are
permanent in nature, unrealized gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage foreign currency risk and unrealized gains and losses related to the Company
available-for-sale securities, net of applicable income taxes. To the extent that such amounts relate to investments that are permanent in nature, no adjustments for income
taxes are made. 
Income Taxes 
Income taxes are computed on the pretax income based on the current tax law. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years of
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date and are based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Valuation
allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets to the extent their ultimate realization is uncertain. Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company financial statements are presented in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. Under APB 25, generally, no compensation expense is recognized in connection with the awarding of stock option grants to employees provided that, as of the
grant date, all terms associated with the award are fixed and the quoted market price of the stock is equal to or less than the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock as defined. As the
Company has only issued fixed term employee stock option grants at or above the quoted market price on the date of the grant, there has been no compensation expense associated with stock options
recognized in the accompanying financial statements. The Company adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which 
46  requires
certain financial statement disclosures, including pro forma operating results had the Company prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based compensation. 
As
required under SFAS123 and SFAS148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, the pro forma effects of
stock-based compensation on net income loss and net income loss per share have been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following weighted
average assumptions: Years Ended December 31 2005
2004
2003 Risk-free interest rate

50 For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is assumed to be expensed over the options' vesting periods. Certain stock options issued to employees of HH Group see
Note3 were forfeited in accordance with plan provisions. Accordingly, the Company has adjusted pro forma stock based compensation expense in the year ended December31, 2003 to reflect
such forfeitures. The pro forma effects of recognizing compensation expense under the fair value method on the Company operating results and per share data are as follows: Years Ended December 31 2005

In December2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement 123R Revised 2004, Share Based
Payment, which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share-based payments, including employee stock options, at fair value. The Company is required to
adopt the statement beginning with the first quarter of 2006. Upon adoption, the Company will be required to recognize compensation on all share-based grants made on or after January1, 2006,
and 
47 
for
the unvested portion of share-based grants made prior to January1, 2006. On various dates throughout the year ended December31, 2005, the Company accelerated unvested options
related to
grants made prior to January1, 2006 in order to mitigate future compensation expense it would have otherwise been required to recognize. 
Stock Option Accelerations 
On December28, 2004, the Company granted approximately 2,800,000 options to executives and employees. Such options vested over the five-month period ending
on May31, 2005 and the vested options generally become exercisable in four annual installments commencing December28, 2005. For the twelve months ended December31, 2005, the
Company recognized approximately $22,229 of pro forma compensation expense, net of tax, related to this grant. 
On
February10, 2005 and May4, 2005, the compensation committee of the Company board of directors approved the acceleration of option vesting terms for approximately 134,000 and
2,600,000, respectively, unvested out of the money employee stock options. Exercise prices of the affected stock options were at or above the Company closing stock price on such dates. As a result
of the accelerated vesting terms, approximately $940 and $20,500, respectively, have been included in pro forma compensation expense, net of tax, for the twelve months ended December31, 2005. On
December14, 2005, the compensation committee of the Company board of directors approved the December29, 2005 acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of substantially all
unvested stock options with exercise prices below $2391 that are held by individuals employed by the Company on December29, 2005, including executive officers. Stock options issued to certain
employees based outside the United States and directors were unaffected by this modification. The acceleration of vesting and exercisability only applied to employee stock options with an exercise
price lower than $2391, as options with exercise prices greater than $2391 were previously modified. As a result of this modification, the Company recognized approximately $5,500 of pro forma
compensation expense, net of tax for the year ended December31, 2005. 
As
of December31, 2005, the Company has accelerated substantially all unvested outstanding stock options in order to mitigate compensation expense that would have been required upon the
effectiveness of SFAS123R beginning January1, 2006. As a result of these actions, the Company has eliminated approximately $26,940 of future after-tax compensation expense
related to these options. The Company does not anticipate material compensation expense relating to employee stock options after January1, 2006. 
Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share does not include the effects of potentially dilutive stock options and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects, in periods in which they have a dilutive effect, commitments to issue common stock and common
stock issuable upon exercise of stock options for periods in which the options' exercise price is lower than the Company average share price for the period.

period, respectively. The Company continuing operations reported income in the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004. Accordingly, certain stock options are considered to have a dilutive
effect during these periods. 2.BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

be granted under the 1999 
59  Plan
is the sum of 30,000,000 and the number of shares that would have been available for new awards under the 1996 Plans if they were still in effect. At December31, 2005, approximately
9,373,047 options were exercisable and 6,266,325 options were available for future grants. 
Amounts
below reflect option activity of employees in the Company continuing operations as well as HH Group employees. The outstanding stock options of the Company were adjusted in 2003 to reflect
the impact of the spin-off transaction. For employees who continued employment with the Company, the option remained an option for Monster Worldwide common stock with the number of shares
and the related exercise price adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value of each option. For
employees who worked for HH Group after the spin-off, certain options were cancelled in accordance with the provisions of the spin-off agreement. December 31, 2005

The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December 31 2005
2004 Deferred tax assets Allowance for doubtful accounts 3,656 3,827 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 1,735 2,911 Accrued business reorganization and spin-off costs 5,963 7,098 Other reserves not currently deductible 3,843 Investments in foreign entities discontinued 12,600 Tax loss carry forwards 82,684 80,627 Tax credits 738 Valuation allowance 62,772 77,907 Deferred tax assets 31,266 33,737 Deferred tax liabilities Property and equipment 6,963 4,629 Intangibles 41,663 28,464 Deferred tax liabilities 48,626 33,093 Net deferred tax assets liabilities 17,360 644 As
of December31, 2005 and 2004, net current deferred tax assets were $8,048 and $12,597 respectively, and net non-current deferred tax assets were $19,989 and $10,166
respectively. Net non-current deferred tax liabilities were $45,397 and $22,119 as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
At
December31, 2005, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards, for U.S. Federal tax purposes of approximately $9,000 which expire in 2020 and operating loss carry forwards in the
United Kingdom of approximately $55,000 with no expiration periods. In addition, the Company also has approximately $169,000 of net operating loss carry forwards in various other countries throughout
the world, of which approximately $139,000 have no expiration date and $30,000 of which expire in years 2007 through 2016. 
Realization
of the Company net deferred tax assets is dependant upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future years in the appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain a benefit from
the reversal of deductible temporary differences and from tax loss carry-forwards. 
The
Company has concluded that, based on expected future results and the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets cannot
be used in the foreseeable future, principally net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established for these tax benefits. During the year ended
December31, 2005, a valuation allowance on a portion of these deferred tax assets was reversed due to taxable income generated in 2005 and expected future taxable income. The valuation
allowance decreased by a 
62  total
of $15,135 of which $2,800 was attributable to tax deductions generated from exercises of employee stock options for which the tax benefit was credited to paid in capital. 
Acquired
tax losses, whose ultimate realization is uncertain, represent $20,554 of the valuation allowance. In the event these losses are ultimately realized, the resulting tax benefit will be
credited to goodwill of the related acquisition. 
Income
taxes related to the Company continuing operations differ from the amount computed using the Federal statutory income tax rate as follows: Years Ended December 31 2005
2004
2003 Income taxes at Federal statutory rate 63,926 34,137 1,021 State income taxes, net of Federal income tax effect 6,804 3,719 624 Tax exempt interest income 914 Non-deductible meals and entertainment 507 1,073 1,229 Effect of foreign operations 1,235 4,338 7,172 Change in valuation allowance 4,902 2,768 7,085 Nondeductible business reorganization and other special charges 4,499 Other 815 861 Income taxes 64,186 32,638 8,147 Provision
has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings have been and will continue to be reinvested but could become subject
to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends, or were loaned to the Company or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Company should sell its stock in the foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to
determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be payable on the undistributed foreign earnings. The Company believes its undistributed foreign earnings are presently insignificant. 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
A Leases

B Consulting, Employment and Non-compete Agreements 
The Company has entered into various consulting, employment and non-compete and/or non-solicitation agreements with certain key management personnel and

and $2,300 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
64  D Litigation 
The Company is subject to various claims from taxing authorities, lawsuits and other complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company records provisions for
losses when claims become probable and the amounts are estimable. Although the outcome of these legal matters cannot be determined, it is the opinion of management that the final resolution of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, operations or liquidity. 
14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Through May2, 2005, the Company leased an office from an entity in which its CEO and other directors and executive officers, had an approximately 84% ownership
interest. This lease was terminated on May2, 2005 in connection with the disposition of the Company TMP Direct marketing business, and the Company no longer occupies this space. Rent expense
paid in 2005 through the disposition date was approximately $185. The

Item 2. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
Monster
Worldwide,Inc. the Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Securities Exchange Act Rule13a-15e, that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and the Company management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company has carried out an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with
the participation of the Company management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company disclosure controls
and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company disclosure controls and procedures were
effective in ensuring that material information relating to the Company is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer by others within the Company during the period in which
this report was being prepared. 
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
The
Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules13a-15f or
15d-15f. The Company internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements. 
All
internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation. 
The
Company management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on its assessment,
the Company believes that as of December31, 2005, the Company internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. In
conducting the Company evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, the Company has excluded the acquisitions of Emailjob and JobKorea which were completed in
2005. The contribution from the Emailjob and JobKorea acquisitions represents approximately 07% and 04% of consolidated revenues and 14% and 07% of income from continuing operations before income
taxes for the year ended December31, 2005, respectively. Refer to Note2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Emailjob and JobKorea acquisitions and
other acquisitions and their impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
There
have been no significant changes in the Company internal controls or in other factors which could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date the Company management carried
out its evaluation. 
The
Company independent registered public accounting firm has issued its report on our assessment of the Company internal control over financial reporting.

conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
As
indicated in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting did not include the internal controls of Emailjob.com SAS and JobKorea, which is included in the 2005 consolidated financial statements of Monster Worldwide,Inc. and constituted
approximately 07% and 04% of consolidated revenues and 14% and 07% of income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December31, 2005, respectively. Management
did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at these entities because the Company acquired these entities during 2005. Refer to Note2 to the consolidated
financial statements for further discussion of these acquisitions and their impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Monster
Worldwide,Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the entities referred to above. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that Monster Worldwide,Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based 
71  on
the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 
We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Monster Worldwide,Inc. as of
December31, 2005 and 2004 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005
and our report dated February3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion. s/BDO SEIDMAN, LLP BDO Seidman, LLP New
