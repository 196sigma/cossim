Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements 1Description of Operations CIBER,Inc. and its
subsidiaries provide information technology IT system integration
consulting and other IT services on an international basis. Our services are offered on a project or
strategic staffing basis, in both custom and enterprise resource planning ERP
package environments, and across all technology platforms, operating systems
and infrastructures. We also resell
certain third party IT hardware and software products. Our clients consist primarily of governmental
agencies, Fortune 500 and middle market companies, across most major industries. Founded in 1974, our consultants serve
clients from over 60 U.S. offices, over 20 European offices, as well as several
offices in Asia/India/Pacific. Our foreign
operations across 16 countries, accounted for 23% of our total revenue in 2005. 2Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies The following is a
description of our more significant accounting policies. aPrinciples of Consolidation The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CIBER,Inc. and
all of its majority-owned subsidiaries together CIBER, the Company, we, our,
or us. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated. At December31,
2005, we owned approximately 95% of the net outstanding shares of Novasoft AG Novasoft. In addition, we have three international
subsidiaries that have minority ownership interests. The minority shareholders proportionate
share of the equity of these subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest
in the consolidated balance sheet. The
minority shareholders proportionate share of the net income or loss of these
subsidiaries is included in other income, net in the consolidated statement
of operations. In 2004, we recognized
minority interest income of $70,000 and in 2005, we recognized minority
interest expense of $341,000. bEstimates The preparation of these
financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. These estimates and assumptions include, but
are not limited to, estimates of revenue earned but not yet billed, costs to
complete fixed-price projects, the collectibility of accounts receivable, the
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, certain accrued liabilities
and other reserves, income taxes, and others.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. cCash and Cash Equivalents Cash
and cash equivalents includes bank demand and time deposits, money market
funds, and all other highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when purchased. Substantially
all of our cash balance at December31, 2005 and 2004 was maintained by
our European subsidiaries, of which, approximately $271 million at December31,
2005 was held by our Novasoft subsidiary.
Until we acquire 100% ownership of Novasoft, our use of their cash,
outside of their business opportunities or needs, is limited under German corporations
law. dAccounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts
receivable are recorded at their face amount less an allowance for doubtful
accounts. On a regular basis, we
evaluate our client receivables, especially receivables that are past due, and
we establish the allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection
issues. 41 eProperty and Equipment Property
and equipment, which consists of computer equipment and software, furniture and
leasehold improvements, is stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed using straight-line and accelerated methods
over the estimated useful lives, ranging primarily from three to seven
years. Direct costs of time and material
incurred for the development of software for internal use are capitalized as
property and equipment. fGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in
excess of the estimated fair value assigned to the net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the
end of the second quarter of each year, or more frequently, if indicators of
possible impairment arise. Goodwill is
not amortized. The impairment review is performed
at the business segment level.
Potential impairment is indicated when the book value of a segment,
including goodwill, exceeds its fair value.
If potential impairment exists, the fair value of the segment is
compared to the fair value of its assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill,
to estimate the implied value of the segments goodwill. Impairment loss is recognized for any excess
of the book value of a segments goodwill over the implied fair value. Other intangible assets arise from business
combinations and consist of customer relationships and non-compete agreements
that are amortized, on a straight-line basis, over periods of up to seven
years. gCapitalized Software Development Costs We account for the development cost of software
intended for sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No86, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed SFAS 86.
SFAS 86 requires product development costs to be charged to expense as
incurred until technological feasibility is attained. The Company determines technological
feasibility to be established upon the internal release of a working model or a
detailed program design as specified by SFAS 86. Capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software product. At December31, 2005, unamortized
software development costs were $25 million and are included in other assets
on the balance sheet. There was no
related amortization expense for the twelve months ended December31, 2005
as the product under development has not yet been released. hLong-Lived
Assets excluding Goodwill We follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be fully recoverable. An impairment loss
is recognized if the sum of the long-term undiscounted cash flows is less than
the carrying amount of the long-lived assets being evaluated. iRevenue Recognition Services revenue is
generally recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. We
consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been
obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable which
generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers and collectibility is
reasonably assured. The majority of our
services revenue is recognized under time-and-material contracts as hours and
costs are incurred. Revenue includes
reimbursable expenses separately billed to clients. Revenue on cost-plus contracts is recognized
based on costs incurred plus the fee earned.
Under certain national, IT services contracts we are required by our
client to act as a billing agent for other service providers to such
client. We recognize the net fee under
these arrangements as revenue. For fixed-price contracts
for system design, development and implementation we recognize revenue based on
the estimated percentage of completion based on costs incurred relative to
total estimated costs. The cumulative
impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and cost is recognized in the
period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Losses, if any, on fixed-price contracts are
recognized when the loss is determined. For
other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized as amounts become billable
in accordance with contract terms, or in the case of 42 outsourcing type
contracts with advanced or irregular payments, revenue is recognized on a
straight-line basis unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned or
obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. In
accordance with EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,
we recognize revenue on arrangements with multiple deliverables as separate
units of accounting only if certain criteria are met. If such criteria are not met, then combined
accounting would be applied to all deliverables whereby all revenue is
recognized based on the accounting applicable to the last element to be
delivered. Other revenue includes resale of third party IT
hardware and software products, sales of proprietary software, as well as
commissions on sales of IT products. Some
software sales arrangements also include implementation services and/or
post-contract customer support. In such
multi-element arrangements, if the criteria are met, revenue is recognized
based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each
element. Software support revenue is
recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement. Revenue related to the sale of IT products is
generally recognized when the products are shipped or, if applicable, when delivered
and installed, in accordance with the terms of the sale. Where we are the re-marketer of certain
computer products, commission revenue is recognized when the products are
drop-shipped from the vendor to the customer.
Our commission revenue represents the sales price to the customer less
the cost paid to the vendor. Unbilled
accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services
performed in advance of billings in accordance with contract terms. Under our typical time-and-materials billing
arrangement, we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis, such as
biweekly or monthly. At the end of each
accounting period, we accrue revenue for services performed since the last
billing cycle. These unbilled amounts
are generally billed the following month.
Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings arise when percentage
of completion accounting is used. Such
amounts are billed at specific dates or at contract completion. Billings in excess of revenue recognized are
recorded as deferred revenue, and are primarily comprised of deferred software
support revenue. j Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases, and to operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are based on enacted tax
rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences
reverse. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax
expense in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
classified as current and non-current amounts based on the financial statement
classification of the related asset and liability. A valuation allowance is provided when it is
more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the
estimated amounts for federal, state and foreign taxes. The determination of the provision for income
tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation
allowance involves judgment. As a global
company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of
the tax jurisdictions where we operate. This
involves making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets,
which can affect the overall effective tax rate. In addition, changes in the geographic mix or
estimated level of pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate. Interim-period tax expense is recorded based
upon our best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for
the full fiscal year. k Stock-based Compensation As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123,
we account for stock-based employee compensation in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees APB 25, and related interpretations, including Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation an Interpretation of APB 25. We measure stock-based compensation cost as
the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of CIBER common stock at the
grant date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock. We recorded compensation expense of $74,000 56,000 and $179,000 in 2003, 2004
and 2005. Generally, no 43 compensation expense is recorded for stock options as
all options typically have an exercise price equal to the market value of our
common stock on the date of issuance. The following table illustrates the effect on net
income and earnings per share had we determined compensation cost for our stock-based
compensation plans based on the fair value method of SFAS 123.

In

approximately 962,000 and 26 million common shares, respectively. The impact of these accelerations is
reflected in the 2004 and 2005 stock-based compensation expense under the fair
value method presented above. All of the
options accelerated in 2004 and approximately 25million of the options accelerated
in 2005 were accelerated on days when their exercise prices were greater than
the market price of our stock and thus, those accelerations did not have a
material impact on our reported expense.
Approximately 172,000 options accelerated during 2005 were accelerated
when the exercise prices of the options were lower than the market price of our
stock, resulting in the Company estimating and recording compensation expense of
approximately $56,000. We accelerated the vesting on all of the above
stock options to avoid future expense related to these options when we are
required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based
Payment SFAS 123R, on January1, 2006 see Note 2 n below. Had the provisions of SFAS 123R been in effect
previously, we believe our practices surrounding grants of employee equity
instruments would have been different. The
weighted average fair values of CIBER,Inc. options granted in 2003, 2004
and 2005 were $360, $394 and $353, respectively. The
fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions

Foreign Currency Translation The assets and
liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at
current exchange rates and revenue and expense are translated at average
exchange rates for the period. The
resulting translation adjustments are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income on the balance sheet.
Gains and losses arising from inter-company international transactions
that are of a long-term investment nature are reported in the same manner as
translation adjustments. 44 Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations as
incurred. Foreign currency gains and
losses on short-term inter-company loans and advances are also included in the
results of operations as incurred. We
recorded net foreign currency gains of $151,000 and $12 million in 2003 and
2004, respectively, and a net foreign currency loss of $12 million in 2005, all
of which are included in other income, net
in the consolidated statement of operations. m Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive
income loss includes changes in the balances of items that are reported
directly as separate components of shareholders equity. Comprehensive income loss includes net
income plus changes in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment and changes
in the net unrealized gain or loss on investments, net of taxes, if any. At December31, 2002, we owned
approximately 10% of ECsoft Group plc ECsoft that we had acquired in the
open market that was accounted for as a marketable security at market
value. In January2003, as a result
of our acquisition of all of the remaining shares of ECsoft, the total ECsoft
purchase price, including the shares held at December31, 2002, have been
accounted for based on actual cost.
Accordingly, the unrealized gain on ECsoft shares of $22 million that
was recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income at December31,
2002, was reversed in 2003. At December31,
2004 and 2005, the entire balance of accumulated other comprehensive income
loss reflected on the consolidated balance sheets relates to cumulative
foreign currency translation adjustment. n Recently Issued Accounting Standard In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R,
which is a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS
123R also supersedes APB25 and its related implementation guidance, and
amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No95, Statement of
Cash Flows. We will adopt
SFAS123R effective January1, 2006.
SFAS123R requires companies to recognize expense in the income
statement for the grant-date fair value of all awards of equity instruments,
including stock options, to employees. Expense is to be recognized over the period
during which employees are required to provide service. Under the modified prospective transition
method we expect to apply, compensation cost will be recognized after the date
of adoption for: 1 the portion of outstanding awards granted prior to the
adoption of SFAS123R for which service has not yet been rendered, and 2 all
subsequent share-based awards. The
implementation of the provisions of SFAS 123R will reduce our reported net
income and earnings per share. We
estimate that the adoption of SFAS 123R will reduce our 2006 net income by
approximately $13 million to $15 million; however, actual results may vary
depending on our future stock price, number of options issued and any future
changes to our employee stock option programs. 3Acquisitions We
have acquired certain businesses, as set forth below, that we have accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and,
accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
results of operations of each acquired business since the date of acquisition. Acquisitions 2005 Effective
July1, 2005, we acquired Knowledge Systems Pvt. Ltd., an India-based
professional services firm specializing in custom application development. The results of this company are reported within
our Commercial Solutions segment. The
purchase price paid on July1, 2005 was approximately $25 million and the
purchase agreement includes the possibility of future earn-out payments
totaling $600,000 to be paid over the next two years. The purchase price was allocated as follows 244,000 to net tangible assets acquired, $50,000 to other intangibles and $22
million to goodwill. During 2005, we acquired
approximately another 1% of the net outstanding shares of Novasoft for
consideration and expenses of $18 million, bringing our total ownership
percentage to 95%. This increased our European
segment goodwill balance by $18 million. 45 During 2005, we
acquired the interest held by a minority shareholder in one of our foreign
subsidiaries for total consideration of approximately $17 million, which
included approximately 20,000 shares of CIBER common stock valued at $186,000. This increased our European segment goodwill
balance by $17 million. On January1,
2005, we acquired certain assets and liabilities comprising an office of
another entity for consideration of approximately $37 million. The results of the acquired offices
operations have been included in our Package Solutions segment. The purchase price was allocated as follows 561,000 to net tangible assets acquired, $400,000 to customer relationships
and $28 million to goodwill. Acquisitions 2004 Novasoft AG Novasoft On
September10, 2004, we acquired approximately 67 percent of the net outstanding
shares of Novasoft AG, an international SAP consultancy, headquartered in
Heidelberg, Germany. We acquired the
Novasoft shares owned by the two founding partners of Novasoft, in a private
transaction, for total consideration of $537 million, consisting of $377 million in cash and 2,338,023 shares
of CIBER common stock valued at approximately $160 million. The value of the CIBER shares issued
was based on the average closing price of CIBER stock for the ten trading days
ended August25, 2004. In October2004, CIBER filed with BaFin, the
German securities authority, a compulsory cash offer to all of Novasofts
public shareholders to acquire the remaining Novasoft shares. Through this public offer, which concluded in
November2004, as well as other open market purchases made in Novemberand
December, we acquired an additional 27 percent of Novasofts shares at a total
cost of $233 million, bringing our total ownership percentage at December31,
2004 to approximately 94 percent.
Novasofts shares trade on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Novasoft and its subsidiaries provide
implementation and other consulting services related to SAP software
products. Novasoft is an SAP Alliance
Partner and implements all of SAPs ERP products including mySAP.com products
and industry specific applications. At
the time of the acquisition, Novasoft had approximately 425 consultants,
located mainly in Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. We acquired Novasoft to expand our
international presence as well as our capacity to deliver SAP related services. We recorded goodwill of $500 million related to the
acquisition of Novasoft. The Novasoft
goodwill has been assigned to our European Operations segment. We expect that none of this goodwill will be
deductible for income tax purposes. We
have assigned $57 million to other intangible assets for the estimated fair
value of customer relationships, which is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over five years. At the date of
the acquisition, Novasoft had tax loss carryforwards in certain foreign
jurisdictions for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded. Any subsequent tax benefits from these loss
carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill. Ascent Technology Group Limited Ascent On May24, 2004 we acquired Ascent
Technology Group Limited and Subsidiaries. Ascent, based in Leicestershire, U.K., provides IT services to medium-size
enterprises, with a particular focus on software implementation and sales,
including both SAP and Sage ERP solutions.
Ascent also developed and sells their
own proprietary customer relationship management software. At the time of the acquisition, Ascent had
approximately 130 consultants. This
acquisition expands our existing U.K. presence and allows us to achieve
economies of scale resulting in reduced overhead costs as a percentage of
revenue. The total consideration paid by CIBER for all of Ascents outstanding
shares was approximately $217 million consisting of $202 million in
cash, and approximately 177,000 shares of CIBER common stock valued at $15
million. The value of the CIBER shares
issued was based on the average closing price of CIBER stock for the ten
trading days ended May19, 2004. We have recorded goodwill of $369 million related to
the acquisition of Ascent. The Ascent
goodwill has been assigned to our European Operations segment. We expect that approximately $500,000 of this
goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes. We have assigned $71 million to other
intangible assets for the estimated fair value of customer relationships, which
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years. 46 SCB Computer Technology,Inc. SCB On March1, 2004 we acquired
SCB Computer Technology,Inc. and Subsidiaries. SCB, based in Memphis, Tennessee, provided IT services similar to CIBER, including
consulting, outsourcing and professional staffing, with a particular focus on
federal and state government clients, and has been combined with our existing
operations. At the date of the
acquisition, SCB had approximately 1,250 consultants. This acquisition primarily expanded our
Federal Government Solutions and State Local Government Solutions
segments, and to a lesser extent, added beneficial customer relationships to
our Commercial Solutions business. We acquired
SCB because we expect that a combined CIBER and SCB will be able to compete
more effectively for larger public sector contracts. The acquisition provided an opportunity to
realize operational efficiencies in the form of lower combined selling, general
and administrative costs, primarily by reducing SCBs corporate administrative
costs.
The total consideration paid by CIBER for all of SCBs outstanding
shares, options and warrants was approximately $573 million consisting
of $443 million in cash, 1,353,000 shares of CIBER common stock valued at
approximately $127 million and replacement employee stock options valued at
$271,000. The value of the CIBER shares
issued was based on the average closing price of CIBER stock for the five
trading days ended three days prior to the closing date. Prior to the acquisition by CIBER, SCB common
stock was publicly traded in the over-the-counter market. We have recorded goodwill
of $634 million related to the acquisition of SCB, which has been allocated to
our Commercial, Federal Government Solutions and State Local
Government Solutions segments see Note 8.
We expect that approximately $233 million of the total SCB goodwill
will be deductible for income tax purposes.
We have assigned $122 million to other intangible assets for the
estimated fair value of customer relationships, which is being amortized, on a
straight-line basis over seven years. SCB
exit costs consisted of $21 million paid to terminate an office lease and $327,000
paid for severance of certain SCB personnel. The following
table summarizes the estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed
liabilities of Novasoft, Ascent and SCB at the date of acquisition

Services
Division of FullTilt Solutions,Inc. On January23, 2004, we
acquired certain assets and liabilities comprising the Services Division of FullTilt
Solutions,Inc. the Services Division for $98 million. The Services Division had operations similar
to CIBER, located in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and has been combined with
CIBERs existing Commercial Solutions operations in those areas. The addition enhanced our business model, expanded our customer base and strengthened
our project delivery capability. This acquisition added approximately 80
consultants. The purchase price was
allocated as follows: $12 million to net tangible assets acquired, $16
million to customer relationships and $69 million to goodwill. Acquisitions 2003 AlphaNet
Solutions,Inc. AlphaNet 
On June25, 2003, we completed our acquisition of AlphaNet. Prior to the acquisition, AlphaNets shares
were publicly traded on the NASDAQ. We
acquired all of the approximately 63 million outstanding shares of AlphaNet
for cash consideration of $405 per share.
The aggregate purchase price for all of AlphaNets shares, including
stock options, totaled approximately $285 million, excluding
transaction-related costs. CIBER paid to
the holders of vested AlphaNet stock options having an exercise price of less
than $405 per share, the amount of $405 minus the exercise price of each
vested stock option. A significant
consideration in arriving at the purchase price was AlphaNets cash balance of
$190 million at closing. AlphaNet,
located in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey, provided IT consulting services similar to
CIBER and had 120 consultants at the time of the acquisition. We acquired AlphaNet to increase our
capabilities and service offerings, and our client base in the New York/New
Jersey metro area. AlphaNet was combined
with our existing Edison, New Jersey operations. ECsoft
Group plc ECsoft Effective January23, 2003, we
completed our acquisition of ECsoft. Prior
to the acquisition, ECsofts shares were publicly traded on the London Stock
Exchange. We acquired all of the
approximately 100 million outstanding shares of ECsoft, not already owned by
CIBER, for cash consideration of 305 pence approximately $494 per share, or
approximately $502 million in the aggregate.
In addition, we had previously acquired approximately 11 million ECsoft
shares in the open market at a cost of approximately $32 million, bringing our
total cost for all of ECsofts shares to approximately $534 million, excluding
transaction-related costs. At the time
of the acquisition, ECsoft, now named CIBER Europe Limited which is
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales had approximately 440
consultants and operations in Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the
United Kingdom that provided IT consulting services similar to CIBER. We acquired ECsoft to expand our European
presence. 48 The following

The AlphaNet
goodwill has been assigned to our Commercial Solutions Segment and the ECsoft
goodwill has been assigned to our European Operations Segment. We expect that all of the AlphaNet goodwill
and $25 million of the ECsoft goodwill will be deductible for income tax
purposes. At the date of the
acquisition, ECsoft had tax loss carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions
for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded. Any subsequent tax benefits from these loss
carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill. We recorded an accrued liability of $574,000
and $25 million for payments of severance for certain AlphaNet and ECsoft
personnel, respectively. 4Sales Sale of IBM Staffing Operation On August1, 2005, we sold the portion of our IBM operation that was
covered by IBMs national staffing contract to a third party. We recognized a gain of $10 million in other
income for the year ended December31, 2005 as a result of this
transaction. The agreement also
specifies future payments may be made to CIBER in the event that performance of
the transferred operation exceeds specified thresholds at the end of each of
the next three years. 49 Sale of DigiTerra Broadband On May31,
2003, we sold our DigiTerra Broadband subsidiary for $23 million, net of
expenses, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $643,000, which has been included in
other income for the year ended December31, 2003. As consideration, we initially received $20
million in net cash proceeds and the remaining $300,000 was received in 2004. DigiTerra Broadband was a wholly owned
subsidiary of CIBER,Inc., that provided technology to automate the sale
and management of broadband, wireless and digital video services. Prior to its sale, DigiTerra Broadband
generated revenue of $795,000 and a net operating loss of $156,000 for the five
months ended May31, 2003. 5Earnings
per Share Pursuant to the terms of our
Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures Debentures, the Debentures may be
converted to shares of CIBER common stock under certain conditions. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted
Earnings per Share EITF 04-8, the dilutive effect of our Debentures has
been included in our diluted earnings per share calculations below. When assuming conversion of the Debentures
for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, we also adjust net
income to exclude the net of tax cost of interest expense on the Debentures. For purposes of
our 2003 and 2004 diluted earnings per share calculations, we assumed that the
Debentures had been fully surrendered for conversion, the result of which would
require us to issue approximately 12,830,000 shares of our common stock. In 2003, however, the Debentures were
outstanding for only one month, thus their dilutive effect was 1,069,000
shares. On January4, 2005, we made
an irrevocable election to settle not less than 30% of the principal amount of
the Debentures surrendered for conversion in cash and not in shares. As a result, our calculations of diluted
earnings per share thereafter assumed conversion of only 70% of the Debentures,
which would require us to issue approximately 8,981,000 shares of our common
stock. On July20, 2005, we amended
our irrevocable election to settle 100% of the principal amount of the
Debentures surrendered for conversion in cash and not in shares. As a result, our calculations of diluted
earnings per share thereafter assumed conversion of none of the
Debentures. Due to the irrevocable
elections mentioned above, our calculations of diluted earnings per share for
2005 were calculated on a pro rata basis and resulted in approximately
4,978,000 shares being included in our diluted weighted average shares for the
year. Subsequent years calculations of
diluted earnings per share will not include any shares related to the
conversion of the Debentures. Our computation of
earnings per share basic and diluted is as follows

10Convertible
Senior Subordinated Debentures On December2, 2003,
in a private placement, we issued $175 million of 2875% Convertible Senior
Subordinated Debentures Debentures due to mature in December2023.
The Debentures are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right
of payment to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities. The Debentures
accrue interest at a rate of 2875% per year. Interest is payable
semi-annually in arrears on June15 and December15 of each year. The Debentures are
convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at an
initial conversion rate of 733138 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
Debentures, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately
$1364 per share, subject to adjustments, prior to the close of business on the
final maturity date only under the following circumstances: 1during any
fiscal quarter if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds 120% of
the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading
day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter; 2during
the five business days after any ten consecutive trading day period in which
the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures for each day of
such period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of our
common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of $1,000 principal
amount of the Debentures; 3if the Debentures have been called for
redemption; or4upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate
transactions. The conversion price is subject to adjustment
in certain circumstances. On January4,
2005, we made an irrevocable election to settle in cash and not in shares, not
less than 30% of the principal amount of the Debentures surrendered for
conversion. On July20, 2005, we increased
our irrevocable election to settle in cash and not in shares 100% of the
principal amount of the Debentures surrendered for conversion. As a result, upon conversion we will deliver
cash in lieu of our common stock. 53 Debenture holders may
require us to repurchase their Debentures on December15, 2008, 2010, 2013
and 2018, or at any time prior to their maturity in the case of certain events,
at a repurchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued
interest. From December20, 2008,
to, but not including December15, 2010, we may redeem any of the
Debentures if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the
conversion price for at least 20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading day
period. Beginning December15,
2010, we may, by providing at least 30-days notice to the holders, redeem any
of the Debentures at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount, plus
accrued interest. Debenture issuance costs
were approximately $58 million and are being amortized over five years to
interest expense. The unamortized debt issuance costs were $34 million
as of December31, 2005. Of this
amount, $12 million is included in prepaid and other current assets and $22
million is included in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 11 Bank Line of Credit, Bank Term Loan and
Financing Agreement Bank Line
of Credit We
have a $60 million revolving line of credit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A that
expires on September30, 2007. The
line of credit will remain unsecured, unless borrowings exceed $40 million for
two consecutive fiscal quarters, or, if certain financial covenant thresholds
are exceeded, in which case, substantially all of CIBERs assets would secure the
line of credit. The interest rate
charged on borrowings under the agreement ranges from the prime rate of
interest prime less 100% to prime less 030%, depending on CIBERs Pricing
Ratio and changes, as required, on the first day of each quarter. CIBERs Pricing Ratio is defined as the ratio
of CIBERs Senior Funded Indebtedness at the end of each quarter, divided by
CIBERs earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA
for the prior four fiscal quarters then ended. Senior Funded Indebtedness means the sum of
our liabilities for borrowed money, excluding our Debentures and any
liabilities under any swap contract. On December31,
2005, the banks prime rate was 725% and our rate for borrowing was 645%. We are also required to pay a fee per annum
on the unused portion of the line of credit.
This fee ranges from 025% to 050%, depending on CIBERs Pricing Ratio
and changes, as required, on the first day of each quarter. The line of credit agreement contains certain
financial covenants including: a maximum senior leverage ratio, a minimum fixed
charge coverage ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and a maximum asset coverage
ratio. We were in compliance with these
financial covenants as of December31, 2005. The terms of the credit agreement also
contain, among other provisions, specific limitations on additional
indebtedness, liens and acquisitions, purchases of treasury stock, investment
activity and prohibits the payment of any dividends. The line of credit provides for the issuance
of up to $15 million in letters of credit.
Any outstanding letters of credit reduce the maximum available
borrowings under the line of credit. At December31,
2005, we had $62 million of outstanding letters of credit securing certain financial
performance obligations. Bank Term Loan
On April9, 2004, we entered into a term loan with Wells Fargo for $60
million that matures on September30, 2006. The term loan bears interest at the same rate
as our line of credit. This term loan is
secured by certain computer hardware.
The outstanding principal balance of the term loan is due in equal monthly
installments of $200,000. At December31,
2005, the term loan had an outstanding principal balance of $20 million. Wholesale Financing Agreement In
connection with our operation as an authorized remarketer of certain computer
hardware and other products, we have an Agreement for Wholesale Financing with
IBM Credit LLC. Outstanding amounts
under this agreement, which totaled $79 million and $86 million at December31,
2004 and 2005, respectively, are included in accounts payable. Our payment of individual amounts financed is
due within normal trade credit payment terms, generally 45 days, and are
without interest. Outstanding amounts
under the Wholesale Financing Agreement are secured by substantially all of our
assets. 12 Financial Instruments The
Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and accounts payable. Due to
their short-term nature, the book value of these instruments approximates fair
value. The Companys financial
instruments also include debt and a cross-currency swap. Book value of the borrowings under our bank
line of credit and bank term loan approximate their fair values due to the
variable interest rates on these borrowings.
We estimate the fair 54 value
of our $175 million Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures to be
approximately $1490 million based on the trading price for our debentures on December31,
2005. We
have numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries, and the net assets of those
subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate volatility. In December2005, we entered into a
one-year cross-currency swap arrangement to partially hedge the foreign
currency exposure associated with our net investment in certain Euro-based foreign
operations net investment hedge. The
notional amount of the swap is 420 million/$500 million. During the term of this transaction, we will
remit to and receive from the counterparty interest payments equal to
three-month EURIBOR plus 011% and three-month U.S. LIBOR rates,
respectively. At December31, 2005,
CIBER pays interest at a rate of 260% and receives interest at a rate of 453%
on the notional amount, and such rates are reset quarterly. These payments will be recorded as an
adjustment to our reported interest expense during the periods. Gains and losses in the net investment in the
Companys subsidiaries due to foreign exchange volatility will be partially
offset by foreign exchange losses and gains related to this net investment
hedge, both of which will be recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income
loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The amount recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income loss
during 2005 related to this swap increased shareholders equity by $219,000. From time to time,
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for investment purposes. These derivative financial instruments
generally have maturities of less than one year and are subject to fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk. These foreign exchange forward contracts do
not qualify as hedges and, accordingly, gains and losses from settlement of
such contracts, as well as changes in fair value of any open contracts are included in other income, net in the
consolidated statement of operations.
Net gains of $376,000 and $748,000 were recorded in 2004 and 2005,
respectively. There were no open forward
contracts at December31, 2005. We manage credit
risk related to our cross-currency swap and our foreign exchange forward
contracts through careful selection of the financial institution utilized as
the counterparty. 13 Income Taxes Income tax expense consists of the following

Our policy is to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable
in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No5 SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we establish the
reserves based upon our assessment of the exposure associated with certain tax
positions. The tax reserves are analyzed
periodically and adjusted, as events occur to warrant adjustment to the
reserves, such as when the statutory period for assessing tax on a given tax
return or period expires, the reserve associated with that period is reduced. In addition, the adjustment to the reserve may
reflect additional exposure based on current calculations. Similarly, if tax authorities provide
administrative guidance or a decision is rendered in the courts, appropriate
adjustments will be made to the tax reserve. At December31, 2005, we have recorded a
tax reserve of $25 million that is included in other accrued expenses and
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The components of the net deferred tax asset or liability are as

56 Based
on our evaluation of current and anticipated future taxable income, we believe
sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the deferred tax
assets. In 2003, we recognized $3,605 of
tax benefit from the closure of a subsidiary that was recorded as a reduction
to goodwill. At
December31, 2005, we have approximately $155 million of net operating
loss NOL carryforwards for U.S. Federal tax purposes resulting from
acquisitions. Annual usage of these U.S.
NOLs are limited under U.S. tax rules, however, they do not begin to expire
until 2020. There is no valuation
allowance for U.S. NOLs as we expect to fully utilize them. At December31, 2005, we also have
approximately $327 million of
foreign NOLs of which approximately $231 million were pre-acquisition NOLs. We have recorded a valuation allowance for over
two-thirds of the foreign NOLs due to the uncertainty over our ability to
utilize them. Approximately 85% of the foreign NOLs do not expire. Any additional realized benefit from any
pre-acquisition NOLs will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill. We
do not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our
foreign subsidiaries, as we consider these to be permanently reinvested in the
operations of such subsidiaries. At December31,
2005, these undistributed earnings totaled approximately $522 million. If some of these earnings were distributed,
some countries may impose withholding taxes; in addition, as foreign taxes have
previously been paid on these earnings, we would expect to be entitled to a
U.S. foreign tax credit that would reduce the U.S. taxes owed on such
distribution. As such, it is not
practicable to determine the net amount of the related unrecognized U. S.
deferred tax liability. 14 Stock-Based Plans Our
stock-based compensation plans are described below. CIBER,Inc. 2004 Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan On April27, 2004, our
shareholders approved the adoption of the CIBER,Inc. 2004 Incentive Plan
to replace the 1994 Employees Stock Option Plan and the Directors Stock
Option Plan, both of which expired on January31, 2004, and the Directors
Stock Compensation Plan, which had no expiration date. As part of this adoption, 5,000,000 shares of
CIBER,Inc. common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2004 Plan. The plan administrators may grant restricted
stock, stock options, performance bonuses or any combination thereof, to
officers, employees and consultants. The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number, nature and
vesting of such awards. The 2004 Plan
also implements a formula stock plan for non-employee directors. Under the formula plan, each non-employee
director will receive a non-statutory option to purchase 20,000 shares of
common stock upon election to the Board of Directors, and an option to purchase
5,000 shares of common stock on each anniversary of election to the Board of
Directors. Anniversary options will be
exercisable one year from grant, and initial option grants will vest in equal
annual increments over a two-year period.
All other options granted under the 2004 Plan become exercisable as
determined at the date of grant by the Board of Directors and all 2004 Plan
options must expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant. The 2004 Plan further provides for a grant of
shares to each non-employee director having a fair market value of
approximately $2,500 for attendance at each meeting of our Board of
Directors. As of December31, 2005,
there are approximately 1,898,000 shares available for future grants under the
2004 Plan. 1994 Employees Stock Option Plan
Prior to this plans expiration on January31,
2004, the plan administrators could grant to officers, employees and
consultants, restricted stock, stock options, performance bonuses or any
combination thereof. The Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors determined the number and nature of such
awards. Options issued under this plan
are set to become exercisable as determined at the various dates of grant by
the Board of Directors and will expire through 2020. Directors Stock Option Plan 
Prior to its expiration on January31, 2004, this plan provided for the
issuance of stock options to non-employee, non-affiliate directors. Such stock options were non-discretionary and
granted annually at the fair market value of our common stock on the date of
grant. The number of options granted
annually was fixed by the plan. Options
outstanding under this plan expire through 2014. SCB
Employee Inducement Award Plan Effective March1,
2004, we established the SCB Employee Inducement Award Plan. This plan was established to provide new
CIBER employees who joined the Company as a result of the SCB acquisition with
CIBER stock options. This is a
single-purpose plan approved by CIBERs Board of Directors 57 under which
options for approximately 275,000 shares were issued. No further options may be granted under this
plan. At December31,
2005, there were approximately 11,295,000 shares of CIBER common stock reserved
for outstanding and available future grants under our stock option plans. A
summary of the status of the CIBER,Inc. stock option plans as of December31,
2003, 2004 and 2005, and changes during the periods ending on those dates is

Directors Stock Compensation Plan On
April27, 2004, this plan was replaced by the 2004 Plan. In 2003 and 2004, we issued 8,220 and 1,542 shares,
respectively, of common stock under this plan. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP Under
our ESPP, eligible employees are allowed to purchase shares of our common stock
at a price equal to 85% of the lower of its fair market value on the first day
or the last day of the quarter. 8,750,000
shares of common stock have been reserved for under the ESPP, of which, approximately
1,748,000 shares are available at December31, 2005 for future issuances. Employees purchased 899,403, 778,732, and 700,472
shares under the ESPP in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. 58 15 401k Savings Plan Almost
all of our U.S. employees are eligible to participate in our 401k savings
plan. The Company matches a portion of
the employee contribution. Vesting in
the Company matching contribution occurs over six years. Forfeitures reduce the Company matching
contributions. We record forfeitures
when a participants employment ends. We
recorded expense of $39 million, $36 million and $45 million in 2003, 2004
and 2005, respectively, related to this plan. 16 Shareholders Equity Stock
Repurchase Put Option In connection with our acquisition of DCI on April30,
2002, DCIs majority shareholder the Shareholder entered into an agreement
to not sell a significant portion of the CIBER common stock received in the
transaction for a period of up to 90 days the Lockup Agreement. As an inducement for the Shareholder to enter
into the Lockup Agreement, CIBER granted the Shareholder an option that under
certain circumstances, the Shareholder could require CIBER to repurchase up to
805,000 shares of CIBER common stock at $725 per share. In May2003, the Shareholder exercised
this option. CIBER paid approximately $58
million for the acquisition of these shares, which were accounted for as
treasury stock. Repurchase Program In 1999, we began a share repurchase program. The program has been amended from time to
time by our Board of Directors to increase the authorized shares available for
repurchase. In total, as of December31,
2005, approximately 11,479,154 shares have been repurchased under this program
since its inception. In December2005,
the Board of Directors revised the Companys share repurchase program to
authorize the Companys management to repurchase up to $75 million of either
common shares or convertible debt, whichever is determined to be more advantageous. In 2005, we repurchased 1,470,000 common shares
under this program at a cost of $105 million.
We did not repurchase any of our convertible debt during 2005. At December31, 2005, there was
approximately $69 million remaining for future repurchases under this program. Shelf Registration Statement on FormS-4
At December31, 2005, we have an
effective registration statement on FormS-4, under which 4,373,967 shares
of our common stock remain available and which may be used from time to time in
connection with future business combinations. Shelf Registration Statement on FormS-3
At December31, 2005, we have an
effective registration statement on FormS-3, under which up to 10,000,000
shares of our common stock may be sold in the future. This registration statement enables us to
raise funds from the offering of common stock from time to time, subject to
market condition and our capital needs. Stock Purchase Rights  On September21, 1998, CIBER,Inc. paid a
dividend of one preferred stock purchase right a Right for each outstanding
share of CIBER,Inc. common stock Common Stock. A Right is also attached to all shares of
Common Stock issued after the dividend date.
Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth
of a share of SeriesA Junior Preferred Stock, par value $001, at a
purchase price of two hundred fifty dollars, subject to adjustment. The Rights become exercisable ten business
days following a public announcement that a person or group has acquired, or
has commenced or intends to commence a tender offer for 15% or more of our
outstanding Common Stock. In the event
the Rights become exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder, other than
the Acquiring Person as defined in the Rights Agreement, to that number of
shares of our Common Stock having a market value of two times the exercise
price of the Right. In the event the
Rights become exercisable because of a merger or certain other business
combination, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase common stock of the
acquiring company having a market value of two times the exercise price of the
Right. If the Rights were fully

Contingencies We are
routinely involved in legal proceedings, audits, claims and litigation arising
in the ordinary course of business. Although,
the outcome of such matters is not predictable with assurance, we do not expect
that the ultimate outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.
However, depending on the amount and timing, an unfavorable outcome of
any such matters could possibly materially affect our future results of
operations or cash flow in any particular period. 18 Business and Credit Concentrations Financial instruments that are potentially subject to
concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. Our cash and cash
equivalents are in high-credit quality short-term investments and held by high-credit
qualified financial institutions.
Accounts receivable are reviewed on a periodic basis, and an allowance
for bad debts is recorded where such amounts are determined to be
uncollectible. Our revenue and accounts
receivable are principally concentrated with large companies across several
industries and governmental entities located throughout the United States and
Europe. 19 Segment Information Our operating
segments are organized internally primarily by the nature of their services,
client base and geography, and they consist of Commercial Solutions, Federal
Government Solutions, State Local Government Solutions, Package
Solutions and European Operations. Our
Commercial Solutions, Federal Government Solutions and State Local
Government Solutions segments comprise our U.S. based CIBER branch offices that
provide IT services and products in custom-developed software environments. These offices report to a segment based on
their primary client focus category Commercial, Federal or State Local;
however, they also may have clients that fall into another category. For example, a Commercial office may also
provide services to a government client.

Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures -
We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information related to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
made known to the officers who certify the Companys financial reports and to
other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Based on their evaluation as of December31,
2005, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rule13a-15eunder the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rulesand forms. Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting - Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f.
CIBERs internal control systems were
designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and board
of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published
financial statements. All internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.
Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal
control may vary over time. Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on
the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31,
2005. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited
by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report, which is included elsewhere herein. Changes in Internal Controls - There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 63 Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and
Shareholders of CIBER,Inc. We have audited
managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that CIBER,Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO
criteria. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion,
managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria. We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended December31, 2005 and our report dated February27, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
