Recent Developments 
On March12, 2002, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of the Company Common Stock in the form of a stock
dividend payable on March28, 2002 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March22, 2002. All share and per share numbers in this Report give effect to such stock
split. 
Products 
The Company markets disposable and metal prophy angles as well as prophy cups, brushes and pastes collectively, Prophy Products, fluorides, infection control
products, dental X-ray equipment, 
3  dental handpieces and related components, orthodontic brushes and supplies, flavored examination gloves, children toothbrushes and toothpastes and other products. Prophy Products.The Company believes it manufactures and sells the broadest line of prophy products in the domestic
professional dental products market. The Company is able to achieve its substantial share of this market by providing prophy products at both premium and popular prices. The Company generally prices
its Young branded prophy products at premium levels and its Denticator branded prophy products at lower price levels. The Company broad range of prophy products enables it to be a single-source
supplier to its distributors. 
Prophy
products consist of three components: 1an angle which is attached to and extends from a standard, low-speed dental handpiece, 2a rubber cup or brush
which is attached to the angle and performs the cleaning function and 3an abrasive paste normally applied to the patient teeth with the cup or brush. During the prophylaxis process, the cup
or brush is filled with abrasive paste, which is applied to the teeth as the prophy cup rotates. The dental professional polishes both the visible portion of the tooth and the subgingival portion
below the gum line. The Company prophy products include several configurations of metal autoclavable prophy angles, single-use disposable plastic prophy angles and several flavors and
consistencies of pastes. Prophy cups and brushes, which are paired with metal prophy angles, are sold as single-use items. Disposable prophy angles are sold as assembled units with a cup
or brush already attached. The Company produces and markets a number of different disposable prophy angles, including both traditional right angle and contra angle configurations. Virtually all of the
Company metal prophy angles are sealed against penetration of matter from patients' mouths thus reducing the risk of cross-contamination and damage to the prophy angle and are designed for easy
maintenance. Because such metal prophy angles function optimally only when used with the Company cups and brushes, most dentists who purchase the Company metal prophy angles also purchase the
Company cups and brushes. 
Other Preventive Products.The Company other preventive products include fluorides used in dental offices and at home to
reduce cavities and tooth sensitivity; applicators used by dental professionals to apply fluoride to patients' teeth; and plaque disclosants, which are liquids or tablets that identify the presence of
plaque when applied to tooth surfaces. 
Infection Control Products.The Company line of infection control products includes products such as surface disinfectants,
cleaners, sterilizing solutions, indicator tape and tabs used to verify the effectiveness of a sterilizer, Nyclave wrap used to wrap instruments during sterilization so that sterility is maintained
until use, barrier products used to wrap operatory knobs, handles and other devices that cannot be sterilized, and surgical milk and instrument care products used to inhibit corrosion, remove rust and
lubricate hinged instruments in connection with the autoclave process sterilization through the use of steam. X-Ray Equipment.The Company markets a line of dental X-ray equipment under the Panoramic brand name.
Panoramic PC-1000 X-ray machine produces a high quality image of the entire dental arch in one X-ray film. Panoramic X-rays present an anatomical
assessment of the entire oral cavity and surrounding structures. The Company believes this allows a dentist to more accurately diagnose and treat the patient, providing better overall care.
Panoramic PC-1000/Laser 1000 cephalometric X-ray system allows analysis of the exact relationship of various anatomical reference points of the patient anterior skull
profile. General dentists and orthodontists use these calculations to locate and predict the movement of teeth in order to fit braces and other orthodontia. The device is used by oral surgeons to
detect pathology and also to determine bone and teeth alignment before and after surgery. 
Handpieces and Components.The Company manufactures and markets a line of high-speed and low-speed
dental handpieces. The Company also offers high-speed and low-speed handpiece repair services. High-speed handpieces, commonly referred to as dental drills, are
used in a variety of operative and restorative dental procedures. Low-speed handpieces are used by dentists and dental hygienists in the teeth cleaning, or prophylaxis procedure.
Prophylaxis angles, such as the disposable or 
4  autoclavable prophylaxis angles sold by the Company, attach to a low-speed handpiece, which provides drive power for the angle. Low-speed handpieces are also used in certain
operative and restorative dental procedures, though to a lesser extent than high-speed handpieces. The Company handpieces are sold under the Athena Champion brand name, as well as
through private label agreements with certain dental distributors. 
Orthodontic and Children Homecare Products.The Company markets a line of orthodontic brushes, flavored examination gloves,
children toothbrushes and toothpastes, and miscellaneous supplies. 
Assisting and Other Products.The Company assisting and other products include disposable aspiration products used to
remove blood, saliva and other matter during dental procedures; cotton roll substitutes used to control saliva and moisture during dental procedures; matrix bands used for tooth restorations; rubber
dam frames used to isolate teeth during dental procedures; and etching gels and bonding prep used to condition tooth surfaces for bonding. 
Private Label and Original Equipment Manufactured OEM Products.In addition to branded products, the Company designs,
develops and produces a limited number of private label and OEM products for dental distributors and other professional dental product manufacturers. 
Marketing and Distribution 
The Company markets its prophy, preventive, infection control and handpiece products to dental professionals worldwide primarily through a network of dental
product distributors. The Company actively supports its distributor relationships with Company sales personnel and independent sales representatives in the United States, independent sales
representatives in Canada and Mexico and sales representatives in countries outside of North America. 
The
Company also uses non-exclusive distributors to service markets in a number of other countries. All major distributors of dental products in North America sell the
Company products, including Henry Schein,Inc. and Patterson Dental Company, which accounted for 146%, and 133% respectively, of the Company sales in 2001. The Company has no formal
agreements with its distributors. They generally purchase products from the Company by purchase order. The Company believes these arrangements are customary in the industry. In addition to marketing
through distributors in the United States, the
Company sells products directly to dental and dental hygiene schools, Veterans Administration healthcare facilities and United States military bases. 
The
Company expends considerable effort educating its distributors about the quality, reliability and features of its products. The Company also advertises its products through industry
publications and direct mail. To supplement its other marketing efforts, the Company provides product samples to dental professionals and exhibits its products at industry trade shows. In addition,
the Company seeks to stimulate interest in its products by providing information and marketing materials to influential lecturers and prominent experts and consultants in the dental industry. The
Company panoramic X-ray products are marketed in the United States and Canada directly to the end user, primarily by direct mail, trade shows and a limited amount of
advertising in trade and professional journals. Panoramic also utilizes distributors to market its products in a number of other countries. 
The
Company orthodontic kits and related supplies and flavored examination gloves are sold directly to orthodontists and dentists. Children homecare products are marketed directly to
dental professionals and government programs, as well as through retail mass merchandisers. Product Development 
The Company engineers and chemists are focused on developing innovative professional dental products and are actively involved in improving the Company
manufacturing processes. Frequently, 
5  these products are designed and developed in response to needs articulated to the Company by dental professionals. For example, the Company designed a short prophy cup for its line of prophy angles
to allow for easier access to the back of the patient mouth. Many of the new products or product improvements developed by the Company are patented. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
The Company manufactures most of its products and product components other than X-ray equipment, certain infection control products, children
homecare products, orthodontic kits and related supplies, and flavored examination gloves. 
Prophy and Other Products.The Company uses a variety of computer numerically controlled machining centers, injection molding
machines and robotic assembly machines and continues to invest in new and more efficient equipment and production lines. The primary processes involved in manufacturing the
Company products consist of precision metal turning and milling, rubber molding, plastic injection molding, component parts assembling and finished goods packaging. The Company has a
one-third interest in International AssemblyInc. IAI, a contract manufacturer located in Mexico that assembles a portion of its disposable prophy angles. 
Pastes, Liquids and Gels.The Company blends and mixes all of its pastes, liquids and gels at the Louisville, Colorado, Earth
City, Missouri, and Brownsville, Texas, facilities. The Company owns equipment used to form and dye-cut expanded polyethylene foam and to dye-cut extruded plastic into finished
products and equipment used to package its products in a variety of container sizes, including prophy paste in unit-dose containers. 
Infection Control Products.The Company manufactures a variety of infection control products, sterilants and cleaners, at the
Louisville, Colorado and Earth City, Missouri facilities. Additionally, certain of the Company infection control products are sourced from domestic manufacturers. 
X-Ray Equipment.X-ray equipment is manufactured and assembled by a contract manufacturer at the
Company premises in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The contract manufacturer supplies labor, purchases most components and performs administrative and logistical functions associated with the production of
the machines. The Company owns all of the tooling, engineering documentation and assembly fixtures used in the process. The Company manufactures its own X-ray generators. 
Handpieces and Components.The Company uses a variety of computer numerically controlled machines to manufacture a number of
the components required to produce its high-speed and low-speed handpieces. Certain other handpiece component parts are sourced from a variety of OEMs.The Company
assembles and provides repair services for its handpieces, and offers repair services for a number of other handpiece brands. Orthodontic and Children Homecare Products.The Company sources most of its orthodontic, children homecare products, and
flavored examination gloves from manufacturers in Asia, principally China and Malaysia. Certain other toothbrush and toothpaste products are sourced from domestic manufacturers. 
Supply.The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials, including bar steel, brass, rubber and plastic resins from
numerous suppliers. The majority of the Company purchases are commodities readily available at competitive prices. The Company also purchases certain additional miscellaneous products from other
manufacturers for resale. 
6  Competition 
The Company competes with manufacturers of both branded and private label dental products in its product offerings. The Company believes it is the leading
manufacturer of prophy angles and surface disinfectants used in the professional dental market in the United States. The Company also believes it is the leading distributor of panoramic
X-ray machines in the United States. 
The
markets for the Company products are highly competitive. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in all of its markets are product features, reliability, name
recognition, established distribution network, customer service and, to a lesser extent, price. The relative speed with which the Company can develop, complete testing, obtain regulatory approval and
sell commercial quantities of new products is also an important competitive factor. Some of the Company competitors have greater financial, research, manufacturing and marketing resources than the
Company and include DENTSPLY International,Inc., Sybron Dental Specialties, Oral-B Laboratories, StarDental, a division of DentalEZ Group, KaVo America, Proctor and Gamble Co.,
Colgate-Palmolive Co., and Planmeca OY.

angle infringes a patent that is exclusively licensed to Sultan. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction and unspecified damages. While this matter is in its early stages, the Company believes it
has meritorious defenses to the claims and intends to vigorously defend this matter. In addition, on January25, 2002, Young filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Missouri asserting that the manufacture of the Sultan disposable prophy angle infringes Young U.S. Patent No5,749,728. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction and
damages.

Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   
General 
The Company develops, manufactures and markets supplies and equipment used by dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants and consumers. The Company product
offering includes disposable and metal prophy angles, prophy cups and brushes, panoramic x-ray machines, dental handpieces drills and related components, orthodontic toothbrushes,
flavored examination gloves, children toothbrushes, children toothpastes, moisture control and infection control products. The Company believes it is the leading manufacturer and distributor of
prophy angles and cups used in teeth cleaning and polishing procedures and dental surface disinfectants in the United States. The Company also believes it is the leading distributor of panoramic
X-ray equipment in the United States. 
The
principal components of the Company growth strategy are to continuously improve its operating efficiencies, to develop new products and to complete strategic acquisitions. In order
to help fund the Company strategy for growth, the Company completed an initial public offering of 35million shares of its Common Stock in November1997, resulting in net proceeds of
$252million. The Company used the proceeds to repay debt incurred with previous acquisitions and to fund future strategic acquisitions. 
On
February27, 1998, the Company acquired the assets of Panoramic for $139million cash plus 93,750 shares of the Company Common Stock and assumed approximately
$39million of Panoramic liabilities, of which $26million was repaid at closing. On April2, 1999, the Company acquired the stock of Athena for $42million in cash
plus $232,000 in notes payable to the previous shareholders. On June13, 2000 the Company acquired the assets of Plak Smacker for approximately $71million in cash. On June12,
2001 the Company acquired the assets of Biotrol for approximately $93million in cash. The results of operations for these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements
since the date of acquisition. The acquisitions were accounted for as purchase transactions. 
On
March12, 2002, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of the Company Common Stock in the form of a stock dividend payable on
March28, 2002 to shareholders of record as
of the close of business on March22, 2002. All share and per share numbers in this Report give effect to such stock split. Critical Accounting Policies 
In December2001, the SEC requested that all registrants include in their MDA their most critical accounting policies, the judgments and uncertainties
affecting the application of those policies, and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions using different assumptions. The SEC indicated that a
critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company financial condition and results and requires management most difficult, subjective or complex judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following accounting policies fit this definition: Allowance
for doubtful accountsThe Company has 35% of its December31, 2001 accounts receivable balance with two large customers see footnote 5with the
remaining balance among numerous customers, some of which are international. Accounts receivable balances are subject to credit risk. Management has attempted to reserve for expected credit losses,
sales returns and allowances, and discounts based upon past experience as well as knowledge of current customer information. We believe that our reserves are adequate. It is possible, however, that
the accuracy of our estimation process could be impacted by unforeseen circumstances. We continuously review our reserve balance and refine the estimates to reflect any changes in circumstances,
however, we cannot guarantee that we will accurately estimate credit losses on these accounts receivable. 
13  InventoryThe
Company values inventory at the lower of cost or market. Management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or
obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated product demand and other knowledge related to the inventory. Demand for our products can fluctuate and our estimates of future product demand may move
or be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory. In the future, if our inventory is determined to be overvalued, we would
be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Likewise, if our inventory is determined to be undervalued, we may have over-reported our
cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our
provision, any significant unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results. Results of Operations

Net SalesNet sales increased $123million, or 239%, to $637million in 2001 from
$514million in 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of sales of Biotrol acquired June12, 2001 and a full year of Plak Smacker acquired on June13,
2000, as well as increased sales of products in the base business. 
Gross ProfitGross profit increased $63million, or 228%, to $336million in 2001 from $274million
in 2000. Gross profit was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Biotrol and a full year of Plak Smacker. Gross margin decreased to 528% of net sales in 2001 from 533% in 2000. This decrease was
primarily attributable to the full year inclusion of Plak Smacker sales, which typically earn lower gross margins. 
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses SGASGA expenses increased $41million, or 301%, to
$179million in 2001 from $138million in 2000 primarily due to the inclusion of expenses of Biotrol and a full year of Plak Smacker. As a percent of net sales, SGA expenses increased
to 281% in 2001 from 268% in 2000 primarily due to higher SGA spending at Biotrol. Income from OperationsIncome from operations increased $21million or 155%, to $157million in 2001 from
$136million in 2000 as a result of the factors explained above. 
14  Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased to $244,000 in 2001 from $99,000 in 2000 as a result of additional borrowings on
the Company credit facility in 2001 to fund the Biotrol acquisition as well as the stock repurchase. Other Expense Income, NetOther income increased $28,000 to $19,000 in 2001 from $9,000 in 2000 as a result of various
income items including rental income, which offset other expenses. 
Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes increased $755,000 in 2001 to $60million from
$52million for 2000 primarily as a result of higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate of 385% in 2001 compares to 386% in 2000. The 2001 rate reflects savings resulting
from federal and state tax planning offset by the phase-in of the 35% tax rate. Year Ended December31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December31, 1999 
Net SalesNet sales increased $87million, or 203%, to $514million in 2000 from
$427million in 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of sales of Plak Smacker acquired on June13, 2000. The balance of the increase was due to higher sales
of products in the base business. 
Gross ProfitGross profit increased $35million, or 147%, to $274million in 2000 from $239million
in 1999. Gross profit was favorably impacted by the acquisition of Plak Smacker and by the increased sales of products in the base business. Gross margin decreased to 533% of net sales in 2000 from
559% in 1999. This decrease was primarily attributable to the inclusion of Plak Smacker sales, which typically earn lower gross margins. 
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses SGASGA expenses increased $16million, or 128%, to
$138million in 2000 from $122million in 1999 primarily due to the inclusion of expenses of Plak Smacker. As a percent of net sales, SGA expenses decreased to 268% in 2000 from
285% in 1999 due to operating efficiencies realized from consolidating prior acquisitions and strong operating expense control. Income from OperationsIncome from operations increased $19million or 166%, to $136million in 2000 from
$117million in 1999 as a result of the factors explained above. 
Interest ExpenseInterest expense decreased to $99,000 in 2000 from $105,000 in 1999. 
Other Expense Income, NetOther expense increased $146,000 to $9,000 in 2000 from $137,000 in 1999 primarily due to a full
year inclusion of the Company portion of the loss from its investment in International Assembly,Inc. IAI during 2000. Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes increased $648,000 in 2000 to $52million from
$46million for 1999 primarily as a result of higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate of 386% in 2000 compares to 390% in 1999. The 2000 rate reflects savings resulting
from federal and state tax planning. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Historically, the Company has financed its operations primarily through cash flow from operating activities and, to a lesser extent, through borrowings under its
credit facility. Net cash flow from
operating activities was $141million, $77million, and $89million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were
$70million, $22million, and $15million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2001 included $33million for additional manufacturing and
office space in Earth City, MO and Fort Wayne, IN, and $23million for additional machinery and equipment. Consistent with the Company historical capital expenditures, future capital
expenditures are expected to include facility improvements, panoramic X-ray machines 
15  for the Company rental program, production machinery and information systems. Other significant uses of cash over the three years are as follows: 
On
November2, 2001, the Company purchased 1,050,000 shares of its common stock from GeorgeE. Richmond, its Chairman, for approximately $149million. The purchase
was financed through borrowings on the Company credit facility. 
On
June12, 2001, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Biotrol for approximately $93million in cash. The purchase price was principally financed with
borrowings on the Company credit facility and cash generated from operations. 
On
June13, 2000, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Plak Smacker for approximately $71million in cash. The purchase price was principally financed
with borrowings on the Company credit facility and cash generated from operations. 
On
May17, 1999, the Company invested approximately $10million in exchange for a one-third interest in IAI. The investment was principally financed with cash
generated from operations. The Company has an option to purchase the remaining two-thirds interest in IAI or to sell its one-third interest back to IAI in 2002. 
On
April2, 1999, the Company acquired Athena. The Company paid approximately $42million in cash and issued approximately $232,000 in notes payable to the previous
shareholders. The cash portion of the purchase price was principally financed with cash generated from operations and borrowings under the Company credit line. 
During
March2001, the Company entered into a one-year $200million credit agreement. The agreement was amended in April and September2001, to extend
the term to three-years and increase the borrowing capacity to $400million. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest at rates ranging from LIBOR+1% to
LIBOR+225% or Prime to Prime+5%. Administrative fees for this agreement range from 15% to 25% of the unused balance. The agreement is unsecured and contains various
financial and other covenants. As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with all of these covenants. During 2001, the Company borrowed under the credit facility to finance the
acquisition of Biotrol, the repurchase of Common Stock, investments in facilities and equipment and for working
capital needs. At December31, 2001, there were $167million in outstanding borrowings under this agreement. Management believes through its operating cash flows as well as borrowing
capabilities, the Company has adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet its needs on a short and long-term basis. 
The
Company has certain contractual obligations and/or commercial commitments. The following table represents the aggregate maturities and expiration amounts of various classes of
obligations at December31, 2001 in thousands: Payments due by period Contractual Obligations

In July2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board adopted SFAS No141 Business Combinations and No142, Goodwill and Intangible
Assets. SFAS No141 requires all business 
16  combinations initiated after June30, 2001 as well as all business combinations for which the date of acquisition is July1, 2001 or later to be accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting. The adoption of SFAS No141 did not impact the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 
Under
SFAS No142, goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its useful life; rather, it is subject to at least annual assessments of impairment. Also, under SFAS
No142, an intangible asset should be recognized if the benefit of the intangible is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred,
licensed, rented or exchanged. The Company stopped amortizing goodwill effective January 1, 2002 in accordance with the provisions above. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over
their estimated useful lives. In addition, the Company is in the process of performing their initial goodwill impairment test. 
In
June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under SFAS No143, the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement
costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. SFAS No143 is required to be implemented by the Company by January1, 2003. Adoption of SFAS
No143 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 
In
August2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS
No144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for the long-lived assets to be disposed of and supersedes SFAS
No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. SFAS No144 establishes a single accounting model for
long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves implementation issues related to SFAS No121. SFAS No144 is required to be implemented by the Company on
January1, 2003. Adoption of SFAS No144 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   
The Company finances a portion of its working capital and capital requirements with cash from borrowings under a revolving credit facility. Due to the variable
interest rate feature on the debt, the Company is exposed to interest rate risks. The Company does not use derivatives to manage its interest rate risks.

YOUNG INNOVATIONS,INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Dollars in thousands, except share data    
1.ORGANIZATION: 
Young Innovations,Inc. and subsidiaries the Company develops, manufactures and markets supplies and equipment used by dentists, dental hygienists,
dental assistants and consumers. The Company product offering includes disposable and metal prophy angles, prophy cups and brushes, panoramic x-ray machines, dental handpieces drills
and related components, orthodontic toothbrushes, flavored examination gloves, children toothbrushes, children toothpastes, moisture control and infection control products. The Company
manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Missouri, California, Indiana, Colorado, Tennessee and Texas. Export sales were less than 10% of total net sales for 2001, 2000 and 1999. 
On
March12, 2002, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of the Company Common Stock in the form of a stock dividend payable on
March28, 2002 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March22, 2002. All share and per share numbers in this Report give effect to such stock split. 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Young Innovations,Inc. formed in July1995 and its direct and indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost which includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead or market. Cost is determined by the first-in,
first-out FIFO method. 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, and additions and improvements that
significantly extend the lives of assets are capitalized. Upon disposition, cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the related accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the
statements of income. The Company provides depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of respective classes of assets as follows: Buildings and improvements
3 to 40 years Machinery and equipment
3 to 10 years Equipment rented to others
4 to 15 years 23 
Other Assets 
On May17, 1999, the Company acquired a one-third interest in International Assembly,Inc., a Texas corporation IAI. The Company paid
approximately $1,050 in cash for this investment. The Company has an option to purchase the remaining two-thirds interest in IAI or to sell its one-third interest back to IAI
in 2002. 
The
Company purchases certain services from IAI at amounts less than would be paid to unrelated parties. These services totaled $830, $632 and $174 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The investment is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Equity income losses using a 3month lag is recorded net, after reduction of goodwill amortized
straight-line over 10years. Goodwill of approximately $931 is based upon the excess of the amount paid for its interest in IAI over the fair value of its portion of IAI tangible
net assets at the date of the investment. The Company share of losses and goodwill amortization for IAI is included in other expenses and totaled $240, $203 and $80 for 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The Company portion of IAI income loss, net of goodwill amortization, for the fourth quarter 2001 is expected to be less than $25. The asset balance at December31, 2001 for
this investment is $527. 
Other
assets also include notes receivable and costs related to patents issued to the Company and patent applications. Capitalized patent costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the patents, generally 17years. 
Intangible Assets  Intangible assets, consisting of goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is determined using the straight-line method
over periods ranging from 10 to 40years. 
Long-Lived Assets 
If facts and circumstances suggest that a long-lived asset may be impaired, the carrying value is reviewed. If this review indicates that the carrying
value of the asset will not be recovered, as determined based on projected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its
estimated fair value. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt. The estimated fair value of these instruments approximates
their carrying value. 
24  Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Advertising costs were $1,834, $1,667 and $1,260 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 
Research and Development Costs 
Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and totaled $516, $602 and $802 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 
Revenue Recognition  Revenue from the sale of products is recorded at the time of passage of title, generally when the products are shipped. Revenue from the rental of equipment to
others is recognized on a month-to-month basis as the revenue is earned. 
Equipment Rented to Others 
Since the acquisition of Panoramic in 1998, the Company owns x-ray equipment rented on a month-to-month basis to customers.
Installation costs of the equipment are capitalized and amortized over four years. A liability for the removal costs of the equipment expected to be returned to the Company is included in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities at December31, 2001 and 2000. 
Other Expense Income 
Other expense income includes the Company portion of losses from its investment in IAI, interest income, rental income, sale of scrap, and other miscellaneous
income and expense items, all of which are not directly related to the Company primary business. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, interest income totaled $96, $119 and $139, respectively. 
Income Taxes 
The Company has accounted for income taxes under SFAS No109, an asset and liability approach to accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred
income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. 
Supplemental Cash Flow Information 
Cash flows from operating activities include $4,611, $4,020 and $4,014 for the payment of federal and state income taxes and $188, $99 and $105 for the payment of
interest during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

25  borrowings on the Company credit facility and cash generated from operations. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction. The preliminary purchase price was allocated based upon
estimates of fair value of assets and liabilities. This excess of purchase price as preliminarily allocated over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired goodwill was $8,121. The Company is

operations for Plak Smacker are included in the consolidated financial statements since June13, 2000. 
On
April2, 1999, the Company acquired Athena. The Company paid $4,241 in cash and issued $232 in notes payable to the previous shareholders. The cash portion of the purchase
price was principally financed with cash generated from operations and borrowings on the Company credit line. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction. The purchase price was

consolidated financial statements since April2, 1999. 
4.SEGMENT INFORMATION: 
Segment information has been prepared in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an

weighted average remaining contractual life of the options outstanding at December31, 2001 is 83years. As of January1, 2002, 674,625, shares were exercisable
with a range of exercise prices from $800 - $1402 with a weighted average price of $1038. 
The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes vesting schedules for each option issued under the Plan. Outstanding options generally vest over four years. The exercise
price was equal to the fair value of the Common Stock at the date of grant. All options expire 10years from the grant date. In
accordance with SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company elected APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employee, and related
interpretations in accounting for the Plan. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Plan. Had compensation costs for the Plan been determined based upon the fair value of the
options at the grant 
30  date consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No123, the Company net income and earnings per share would approximate the pro forma amounts below: Year Ended

fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: idividend
yield of 0%; iiexpected volatility of 437% and 278% for 2001 and 1999, respectively; iiirisk free interest rate of 48% and 64% for 2001 and 1999, respectively; and
ivexpected life of 80years for 2001 and 1999. The weighted average fair value of the options at the grant date was $849 and $498 for 2001 and 1999, respectively. No options were
granted in 2000. 
Restricted Stock 
Under the above Plan, restricted stock may be awarded or sold to participants under terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee. For restricted
stock grants, compensation expense is based upon the grant date market price and is recorded over the vesting period. In October 2001, the Company granted 120,000 shares of restricted stock to certain
executive officers of the Company. No monetary consideration was paid by the officers who received the restricted stock. These shares vest 20% each year for five years starting in October 2002. For
the year ended December31, 2001, the Company recorded $74 of compensation expense related to the restricted stock grants. 14.EARNINGS PER SHARE: 
Basic earnings per share Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share Diluted EPS include the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock, if any, using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted earnings per share: 2001

21.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
In July2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board adopted SFAS No141 Business Combinations and No142, Goodwill and Intangible
Assets. SFAS No141 requires all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 as well as all business combinations for which the date of acquisition is July1, 2001 or
later to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The adoption of SFAS No141 did not effect the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Under
SFAS No142, goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its useful life; rather, it is subject to at least annual assessments of impairment. Also, under SFAS
No142, an intangible asset should be recognized if the benefit of the intangible is obtained through contractual or other legal 
34  rights or if the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. The Company stopped amortizing goodwill effective January1, 2002 in accordance with the provisions
above. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. In addition, the Company is in the process of performing their initial goodwill impairment test. 
In
June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under SFAS No143, the fair value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement
costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. SFAS No143 is required to be implemented by the Company by January1, 2003. Adoption of SFAS
No143 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. In
August2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS
No144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for the long-lived assets to be disposed of and supersedes SFAS
No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. SFAS No144 establishes a single accounting model for
long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves implementation issues related to SFAS No121. SFAS No144 is required to be implemented by the Company on
January1, 2003. Adoption of SFAS No144 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 
22.SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
The Board of Directors of the Company authorized a three-for-two stock split on all issued shares of its Common Stock, payable
