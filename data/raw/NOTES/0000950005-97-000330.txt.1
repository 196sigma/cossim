18             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Network Peripherals Inc.
In our opinion, the financial statements listed in the accompanying index
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Network Peripherals Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and 1995 and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. PRICE WATERHOUSE LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY
Network Peripherals Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation, is engaged in
developing and manufacturing high performance client/server workgroup networking
solutions, which it markets primarily to original equipment manufacturers,
value-added resellers, distributors and system integrators. The Company
solutions are designed to be used in departmental and workgroup networks.
NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company subsidiary in Taiwan is the local
currency. Assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are translated into U.S.
dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and
expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the period.
Accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders' equity.
Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not material in all periods
presented, and are included in the results of operations.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
Management determines the appropriate  classification of debt and equity
securities at the time of purchase and reassesses the classification at each
reporting date.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of 90 days or
less to be cash equivalents. All of the Company short-term investments,
consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities, have been classified as
available for sale. For the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, there were
no material unrealized gains or losses. At December 31, 1996 the average
maturity of the short-term  investments was approximately  seven months.
Substantially all short-term investments are held in the Company name by major
financial institutions.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon product shipment provided no
significant obligations remain, and collectability is probable. The Company
provides to certain distributors limited rights of return and price protection
on unsold inventory when specific conditions exist. Provisions for estimated
costs of warranty repairs, returns and allowances, and retroactive price
adjustments are recorded at the time products are shipped. Funding under certain
development contracts is recognized based upon the percentage of completion
method, and in some instances, based upon achievement of specified contract
milestones. Such funding is recognized as an offset to the related development
costs and totaled approximately $556,000, $906,000, and $371,000 in 1996, 1995
and 1994, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Sales Reserves
The Company provides allowances for accounts receivables deemed uncollectible,
and for sales returns and other credits, including credits for retroactive price
adjustments and for sales transacted within 90 days prior to the period-end. As
of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company allowances for such potential
events totaled $1,154,000 and $738,000, respectively. As a percentage of sales
transacted within 90 days prior to December 31, 1996 and 1995, the allowances
for sales returns and other credits were 72% and 52%, respectively.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist  principally of cash, cash  equivalents,  short-term
investments and trade receivables. The Company cash investment policies limit
investments to those that are short-term and low risk. Concentration of credit
risk with respect to trade receivables is generally limited due to the large
number of customers comprising the Company customer base, their dispersion
across many different geographies, and the Company on-going evaluation of its
customers' credit worthiness.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out
method, or market.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically
three years.
Software Development Costs
The Company software products are integrated into its hardware products and
are typically available for general release to customers within 30 days after
technological feasibility has been achieved. Accordingly, the production costs
incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before general
release to customers are immaterial, thus the Company does not capitalize any
software development costs.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, which
recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences
of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
their financial statement reported amounts.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of NuCom Systems Inc.
NuCom, see Note 8 over the fair value of the identifiable net assets
acquired, and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of
benefit, which ranges from nine months to five years. Amortization of goodwill
for the year ended December 31, 1996 was included in cost of goods sold.
Periodically, the Company evaluates the goodwill for impairment, and estimates

provide for an initial option grant for the purchase of 15,000 shares of Common
Stock with annual grants thereafter on the date of the annual meeting in the
