Organization
and Basis of Presentation   The Boston Beer Company, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company are engaged in the business of selling low
alcohol beverages throughout the United States and in selected
international markets, under the trade names The Boston
Beer Company, Twisted Tea Brewing Company and
HardCore Cider Company. The Companys Samuel
Adams
beers and Sam Adams
Light
are produced and sold under the trade name, The Boston
Beer Company.   
B.
Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Fiscal
Year   The Companys fiscal year is a fifty-two or fifty-three
week period ending on the last Saturday in December. The fiscal
periods of 2008, 2007, and 2006 consist of fifty-two weeks.   Principles
of Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are
wholly-owned. All intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated in consolidation.   Segment
Reporting   The Company consists of a single operating segment that produces
and sells low alcohol beverages. The Companys brands,
which include Samuel
Adams   Sam Adams
Light   Twisted
Tea
and
HardCore   are predominantly malt beverages, which are sold to the same
types of customers in similar size quantities, at similar price
points and through substantially the same channels of
distribution. The Companys products are manufactured using
similar production processes and have comparable alcohol content
and constitute a single group of similar products.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents at December27, 2008 and
December29, 2007 included cash on-hand and money market
instruments that are highly liquid investments.   Short-Term
Investments   The Company classifies its investments depending on the
Companys intent and the nature of the investment. In
January 2008, the Company liquidated all of its short-term
investments. As of December29, 2007, the Companys
short-term investments consisted of municipal auction rate
securities. These investments were classified as trading
securities which are recorded at fair market value and whose
change in fair market value is recorded in earnings.   
42 Table of Contents   THE
BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts that is
based on historical trends, customer knowledge, any known
disputes, and the aging of the accounts receivable balances
combined with managements estimate of future potential
recoverability.   Concentrations
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
equivalents and trade receivables. The Company places its cash
equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions that
participate in the U.S.Treasurys Temporary Guarantee
Program. This program protects market investment balances as of
September19, 2008 through April30, 2009. As of
December27, 2008, the Companys cash and cash
equivalents were invested in investment-grade, highly-liquid
U.S.government agency corporate money market accounts.   The Company sells primarily to independent beer distributors
across the United States. Sales to foreign customers are
insignificant. Receivables arising from these sales are not
collateralized; however, credit risk is minimized as a result of
the large and diverse nature of the Companys customer
base. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts
based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific
customers, historical trends and other information. There were
no individual customer accounts receivable balances outstanding
at December27, 2008 and December29, 2007 that were
in excess of 10% of the gross accounts receivable balance on
those dates. No individual customers represented more than 10%
of the Companys revenues during fiscal years 2008, 2007
and 2006.   Financial
Instruments and Fair Value of Financial
Instruments   The Companys primary financial instruments consisted of
cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable at
December27, 2008 and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable at
December29, 2007. The carrying amounts of these financial
instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term
nature of these instruments.   Inventories   Inventories consist of raw materials, work in process and
finished goods. Raw materials, which principally consist of
hops, other brewing materials and packaging, are stated at the
lower of cost
first-in,
first-out basis or market. The cost elements of work in process
and finished goods inventory consist of raw materials, direct
labor and manufacturing overhead. Packaging design costs are
expensed as incurred.   The provisions for excess or expired inventory are based on
managements estimates of forecasted usage of inventories.
A significant change in the timing or level of demand for
certain products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in
recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory
in the future. Provisions for excess inventory are included in
cost of goods sold.   The computation of the excess hops inventory requires management
to make certain assumptions regarding future sales growth,
product mix, cancellation costs, and supply, among others. The
Company manages inventory levels and purchase commitments in an
effort to maximize utilization of hops on hand and hops under
commitment. The Companys accounting policy for hops
inventory and purchase commitments is to recognize a loss by
establishing a reserve to the extent inventory levels and
commitments exceed forecasted needs as determined by the
Companys brewmasters. The Company has not recorded any
loss on purchase commitments in the fiscal years 2008, 2007 and
2006.

BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Property,
Plant and Equipment   Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Major
renewals and betterments that extend the life of the property
are capitalized. Some of the Companys equipment is used by
other brewing companies to produce the Companys products
under brewing service arrangements NoteJ. Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method based upon the
estimated useful lives of the underlying assets as follows   	
Kegs   5years   Machinery and plant equipment   3 to 15years, or the term of the production agreement,
whichever is shorter   Tankage   20years   Office equipment and furniture   3 to 5years   Leasehold improvements   Lesser of the remaining term of the lease or estimated useful
life of the asset   Building   15 to 20years   Goodwill   Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the
Company-owned Cincinnati Brewery over the fair value of the net
assets acquired upon the completion of the acquisition in
November 2000 and relates to the Companys single operating
unit. The Company does not amortize goodwill, but performs an
annual impairment analysis of goodwill by comparing the carrying
value and the fair value of its single reporting unit at the end
of the third quarter of every fiscal year. The Company has
concluded that its goodwill was not impaired as of
December27, 2008 and December29, 2007.   Long-lived
Assets   Long-lived assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over
their estimated useful lives. For purposes of determining
whether there are any impairment losses, as further discussed
below, management has historically examined the carrying value
of the Companys identifiable long-lived assets, including
their useful lives, when indicators of impairment are present.
For all long-lived assets, if an impairment loss is identified
based on the fair value of the asset, as compared to the
carrying value of the asset, such loss would be charged to
expense in the period the impairment is identified. Furthermore,
if the review of the carrying values of the long-lived assets
indicates impairment of such assets, the Company may determine
that shorter estimated useful lives are more appropriate. In
that event, the Company will be required to record additional
depreciation in future periods, which will reduce earnings.   Factors generally considered important which could trigger an
impairment review on the carrying value of long-lived assets
include the following: 1significant underperformance
relative to expected historical or projected future operating
results; 2significant changes in the manner of use of
acquired assets or the strategy for the Companys overall
business; 3underutilization of assets; and
4discontinuance of products by the Company or its
customers. The Company believes that the carrying value of its
long-lived assets was realizable as of December27, 2008.   Deposits   The Company collects a deposit when certain containers are
shipped. This deposit is refunded to the distributors upon
return of the containers to the Company. An estimate of deposit
liability, which is included in current liabilities, is based on
historical information and this computation requires that
management make certain estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts in the financial statements in the
reporting period. Actual deposit redemptions could differ from
the estimates used to compute the allowance for deposits.   
44 Table of Contents   THE
BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Promotional
Activities Accrual   Throughout the year, the Companys sales force engages in
numerous promotional activities. In connection with its
preparation of financial statements and other financial
reporting, management is required to make certain estimates and
assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expenditures
resulting from these activities. Actual expenditures incurred
could differ from managements estimates and assumptions.   Distributor
Promotional Discount Allowance   The Company enters into promotional discount programs with its
various distributors for certain periods of time. The
agreed-upon
discount rates are applied to certain distributors sales
to retailers, based on volume metrics, in order to determine the
total discounted amount. The computation of the discount accrual
requires that management make certain estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of related assets at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
during the reporting period. Actual promotional discounts owed
and paid could differ from the estimated accrual.   Stale
Beer Accrual   In certain circumstances and with the Companys approval,
the Company accepts and destroys stale beer that is returned by
distributors. The Company credits approximately fifty percent of
the distributors cost of the beer that has passed its
expiration date for freshness when it is returned to the Company
or destroyed. The Company establishes an accrual based upon both
historical returns activities, which is applied to an estimated
lag time for receipt of product, and the Companys
knowledge of specific return transactions. The actual stale beer
expense incurred by the Company could differ from the estimated
accrual.   Income
Taxes   The Company provides for deferred taxes using an asset and
liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been recognized in the Companys
consolidated financial statements or tax returns. This results
in differences between the book and tax bases of the
Companys assets and liabilities and carryforwards, such as
tax credits. In estimating future tax consequences, all expected
future events, other than enactment of changes in the tax laws
or rates, are generally considered. Valuation allowances are
provided to the extent deemed necessary when realization of
deferred tax assets appears unlikely.   The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves
dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations in several different state tax jurisdictions. The
Company is periodically reviewed by tax authorities regarding
the amount of taxes due. These reviews include inquiries
regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation
of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company records
estimated reserves for exposures associated with positions that
it takes on its income tax returns. Through December30,
2006, the Company recorded estimated income tax reserves as it
deemed necessary in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No5,
Accounting for Contingencies. At the beginning of fiscal
2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation FIN No48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This interpretation clarifies
the accounting and financial statement reporting for uncertainty
in income taxes recognized by prescribing a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return.   Other
Taxes   The Company is responsible for compliance with the Alcohol and

by the TTB. The Company calculates its excise tax expense based
upon units produced and on its understanding of the applicable
excise tax laws.   Revenue
Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time when
the product is shipped and the following conditions exist:
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title has passed
to the customer according to the shipping terms, the price is
fixed and determinable, and collection of the sales proceeds is
reasonably assured.   Cost
of Goods Sold   The following expenses are included in cost of goods sold: raw
material costs, packaging costs, costs and income related to
deposit activity, purchasing and receiving costs, manufacturing
labor and overhead, brewing and processing costs, inspection
costs relating to quality control, inbound freight charges,
depreciation expense related to manufacturing equipment and
warehousing costs, which include rent, labor and overhead costs.   Shipping
Costs   Costs incurred for the shipping of products to customers are
included in advertising, promotional and selling expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company
incurred shipping costs of $303million,
$255million and $222million in fiscal years 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively.   Advertising
and Sales Promotions   The following expenses are included in advertising, promotional
and selling expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements
of income: media advertising costs, sales and marketing
expenses, salary and benefit expenses for the sales and sales
support workforce, promotional activity expenses, freight
charges related to shipments of finished goods from
manufacturing locations to distributor locations, and point of
sale items.   The Company reimburses its wholesalers and retailers for
promotional discounts, samples and certain advertising and
marketing activities used in the promotion of the Companys
products. The reimbursements for discounts to wholesalers are
recorded as reductions to net revenue. The Company has sales
incentive arrangements with its wholesalers based upon
performance of certain marketing and advertising activities by
the wholesalers. Depending on applicable state laws and
regulations, these activities promoting the Companys
products may include, but are not limited to, the following:
point-of-sale merchandise placement, product displays and
promotional programs at retail locations. The costs incurred for
these sales incentive arrangements and advertising and
promotional programs are included in advertising, promotional
and selling expenses during the period in which they are
incurred. Total advertising and sales promotional expenditures
of $637million, $642million and $585million
were included in advertising, promotional and selling expenses
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for fiscal
years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of these amounts,
$55million, $54million and $56million
related to sales incentives, samples and other promotional
discounts and $295million, $295million and
$288million related to advertising costs for fiscal years
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   The Company conducts certain advertising and promotional
activities in its wholesalers markets and the wholesalers
make contributions to the Company for such efforts.
Reimbursements from wholesalers for advertising and promotional
activities are recorded as reductions to advertising,
promotional and selling expenses.

and Administrative Expenses   The following expenses are included in general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income: general and administrative salary and
benefit expenses, insurance costs, professional service fees,
rent and utility expenses, meals, travel and entertainment
expenses for general and administrative employees, and other
general and administrative overhead costs.   Stock-Based
Compensation   The Company accounts for share-based awards according to
SFASNo123 revised
SFASNo123R, Share-Based
Payment, which generally requires recognition of share-based
compensation costs in financial statements based on fair value.
Compensation cost is recognized over the period during which an
employee is required to provide services in exchange for the
award the requisite service period. The amount of compensation
cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income is
based on the awards ultimately expected to vest, and therefore,
reduced for estimated forfeitures.   As permitted by SFASNo123R, the Company elected to
use the modified-prospective application as its transition
method, under which SFASNo123R applies to new
awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after
the statements effective date of January1, 2006.
Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for
which the requisite service has not been rendered that are
outstanding on January1, 2006 is recognized based on the
fair value estimated on grant date and as the requisite service
is rendered on or after January1, 2006. Prior period
financial statements are not restated to reflect the effect of
SFASNo123R under the modified-prospective
transition method.   For stock options granted prior to the adoption of
SFASNo123R on January1, 2006, fair values
were estimated on the date of grants using a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. As permitted by SFASNo123R,
the Company elected to use a lattice model, such as the binomial
option-pricing model, to estimate the fair values of stock
options granted on or after January1, 2006, with the
exception of the 2008 stock option grant to the Companys
Chief Executive Officer, which is considered to be a
market-based award and was valued utilizing the Monte Carlo
Simulation pricing model, which calculates multiple potential
outcomes for an award and establishes fair value based on the
most likely outcome. See NoteL for further discussion of
the application of the option-pricing models.   Further, SFASNo123R requires that cash retained as
a result of tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation
costs relating to share-based awards be presented in the
statement of cash flows as a financing cash inflow with a
corresponding operating cash outflow.   Net
Income Per Share   Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income
by the weighted-average common shares outstanding. Diluted net
income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted-average common shares and potentially dilutive
securities outstanding during the period using the treasury
stock method.   Reclassifications   Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified in order
to conform to current presentation.   Product
Recall   Prior to announcing the voluntary product recall on
April7, 2008, the Company had not had a significant
product recall. The Company establishes reserves for product
recalls on a product-specific basis when circumstances giving
rise to the recall become known. Facts and circumstances related
to any recall, including   
47 Table of Contents   THE
BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   where the product affected by the recall is located for
example, with wholesale, retail and drinkers or in the
Companys inventory and cost estimates for any fees and
incentives to wholesalers for their effort to return the
products, freight and destruction charges for returned products,
warehouse and inspection fees, repackaging materials,
point-of-sale materials and other costs are considered when
establishing reserves for product recall. These factors are
updated and reevaluated each period and the related reserves are
adjusted when these factors indicate that the recall reserves
are either insufficient to cover or exceed the estimated product
recall expenses.   Significant changes in the assumptions used to develop estimates
for product recall reserves could affect key financial
information, including accounts receivable, inventories, net
revenues, gross profit, operating expenses and net income. In
addition, estimating product recall reserves requires a high
degree of judgment in areas such as estimating the quantity of
recalled products not yet consumed, the allocation of recalled
products sold to drinkers and the portion held at retail and
wholesale, incentives to be earned by wholesalers for their
effort to return the products, future freight rates, and the way
in which drinkers might be compensated for their claims or
affected products they hold.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value
Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued
Staff Position FSP
No157-2,
delaying the effective date of SFASNo157 for
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. The Company
adopted the provisions of SFASNo157 related to
financial assets and liabilities and items that are recognized
at fair value on a recurring basis on December30, 2007,
the first day of its 2008 fiscal year. The partial adoption of
SFASNo157 related to financial assets and financial
liabilities did not have an effect on the Companys
consolidated financial position, operations and cash flows for
the fiscal year ended December27, 2008.   As permitted by FSP
No157-2,
the Company will not apply the provisions of
SFASNo157 to the following items until 2009:
property, plant and equipment and goodwill. The Company is in
the process of evaluating the impact of the deferred provisions
of SFASNo157 on its 2009 consolidated financial
position, operations and cash flows.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo158,
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of FASB Statements
No87, 88, 106 and 132R, which applies to all plan
sponsors who offer defined benefit postretirement plans.
SFASNo158 requires recognition of the funded status
of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the statement of
financial position and expanded disclosures in the notes to
financial statements. The Company adopted this provision for the
year ended December30, 2006 and the adoption did not have
a material impact on its consolidated financial position. In
addition, SFASNo158 requires measurement of plan
assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the plan
sponsors fiscal year end. The Company adopted the
measurement provision of SFASNo158 for its fiscal
year ended December27, 2008 which did not have a material
effect on its 2008 consolidated financial position, operations
and cash flows.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159, The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No115. SFASNo159 permits companies to
choose to measure many financial instruments at fair value, that
are not currently required to be measured at fair value, at
specified election dates under its fair value option. Unrealized
gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has
been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent
reporting date. This statement also establishes presentation and
disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons
between companies that choose different measurement attributes
for similar types of assets and liabilities. The Company adopted
the provisions of SFASNo159 in the first quarter of
2008, but did not elect the fair value option for any of its
financial assets and financial liabilities.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo141
revised SFASNo141R, Business
Combinations, which replaces SFASNo 141, Business
Combinations. SFASNo141R will significantly
change the accounting for business combinations and an acquiring
entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date
fair value with limited exceptions. In addition to new financial
statements disclosures, SFASNo141R will also change
the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including
the expensing of acquisition costs and restructuring costs
associated with a business combination, and changes in deferred
tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties
after the acquisition date which generally will affect income
tax expense. SFASNo141R applies prospectively to
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
after the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2009 period,
with the exception of the accounting of valuation allowances on
deferred tax assets and acquired tax contingencies for which the
adoption is retrospective. The Company will evaluate the impact
of SFAS141R on its consolidated financial statements in
the event future business combinations are contemplated.

assets of $122million, $65million and
$48million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.   As part of its strategy of combining brewery ownership with
production arrangements at breweries owned by third parties, on
June2, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of
substantially all of the assets of a brewery located in
Breinigsville in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania the
Pennsylvania Brewery from Diageo North America,
Inc. Diageo in exchange for cash. The Company
intends to brew a significant portion of its products at the
Pennsylvania Brewery. The aggregate purchase price for the
acquisition of assets was $565million, which includes
$546million in purchase price and $19million in
transaction costs, and represents property, plant and equipment.
In June 2008, the Company reclassified $115million
representing previously made deposits to Diageo and transaction
costs from other assets to property, plant and equipment, net,
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.   In 2007, the Company purchased land in Freetown, Massachusetts
for approximately $60million as protection against the
possibility that the results of the due diligence on the
Pennsylvania Brewery might prove unsatisfactory. In February
2008, after concluding that it would proceed with the
Pennsylvania Brewery purchase, the Company placed the land in
Freetown, Massachusetts on the market. As of December27,
2008, the Freetown land is included in property, plant and
equipment at its original cost and deemed held and used. The
Company continues to actively market the land and has determined
that the fair market value of the land exceeds its carrying
amount at cost.   Impairment
of Long-lived Assets   During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company incurred a
$19million impairment charge related to machinery and
equipment held at a third-party brewery. The impairment was a
result of the Company stopping brewing at a third-party brewery
where the Company owned machinery and equipment, as brewing was
transferred to the Pennsylvania Brewery. In performing the
evaluation of its long-lived assets held at the-third party
brewery as of December27, 2008, the Company concluded that
there was too much uncertainty about assigning a probability as
to the eventual timing of cash flows related to these assets,
and therefore, recorded an impairment charge in the amount of
$19million.   During the second quarter of 2007, the Company incurred an
impairment charge of $34million related to capitalized
costs for the Freetown, Massachusetts brewery project. The
Company concluded that the likelihood of this project
significantly diminished as the Companys negotiations with
Diageo progressed and ultimately

credit facility was amended to increase the revolving line of
credit to $500million, to extend the expiration date to
March31, 2013 and to modify certain other terms of the

through additional paid-in capital due to the effect of equity
transactions. Unrecognized tax benefits are included in accrued
expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax
position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the
amount recorded.   The Companys state income tax returns remain subject to
examination for three or four years depending on the
states statute of limitations. In addition, the Company is
generally obligated to report changes in taxable income arising
from federal income tax audits.   In October 2006, the Internal Revenue Service IRS
commenced an examination of the Companys 2004 and 2005
consolidated corporate income tax returns. At December29,
2007, the examination was in progress. Concurrent with the IRS
examination, the Company reviewed its judgments related to
certain tax positions taken on the Companys consolidated
federal and state income tax returns relating to deductibility
of meals and entertainment expenses and certain other business
expenses. As a result, the Company increased its   
53 Table of Contents   THE

STATEMENTSContinued   unrecognized tax benefits by $13million as a change in
estimate in 2007. In March 2008, in connection with the
completion of the IRS examination, the Company made a payment of
$08million. In August 2008, the IRS commenced an
examination of the Companys 2006 consolidated corporate
income tax returns. In 2008, in connection with the completion
of the 2006 IRS examination, the Company made a payment of
$04million. The completion of the IRS examinations of the
Companys 2004, 2005 and 2006 consolidated corporate income
tax returns in 2008 resulted in a reduction of unrecognized tax
benefits of $13million.   In August 2007, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
with the Massachusetts Department of Revenue Mass
DOR regarding certain apportionment issues related to the
2002 and 2003 tax years, which resulted in a reduction of
unrecognized tax benefits by $08million. In August 2008,
the Mass DOR commenced an examination of the Companys
2004, 2005 and 2006 consolidated corporate income tax returns.
At December27, 2008, the examination was in progress.   In 2007 and 2008, the Company was audited by various other
states and the completion of those audits in 2008 resulted in a
reduction of unrecognized tax benefits of $04million. At
December27, 2008, there is one state examination in
addition to the Massachusetts audit in process.   It is reasonably possible that the Companys unrecognized
tax benefits may increase or decrease significantly in 2009 due
to the commencement or completion of certain state income tax
audits. However, the Company cannot estimate the range of such
possible changes. The Company does not expect that any potential
changes would have a material impact on the Companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Commitments   The Company had outstanding non-cancelable purchase commitments
related to advertising contracts of approximately
$130million at December27, 2008, most of which are
expected to be incurred in fiscal 2009. The Company had various
other non-cancelable purchase commitments at December27,
2008, which amounted to $98million.   The Company uses specific hops for its beer. These hops include
Hallertau-Hallertauer, Tettnang-Tettnanger and Spalt-Spalter and
are harvested in several specific regions in Germany. To a
lesser extent, the Company uses traditional English hops from
England. The Company has entered into contracts for the supply
of a substantial portion of its normal hops requirements. These
purchase contracts extend through crop year 2015 and specify
both the quantities and prices, mostly denominated in Euros, to
which the Company is committed. The Company does not use forward
currency exchange contracts and intends to purchase future hops
using the exchange rate at the time of purchase. Purchases under
these hops contracts were approximately $93million,
$53million and $32million for fiscal years 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December27, 2008,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
various production arrangements with other brewing companies.
During 2008, approximately 52% of the Companys core
products were brewed by its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Samuel
Adams Brewery Company, Ltd., at the Cincinnati Brewery, and
Samuel Adams Pennsylvania Brewery Company, at the Pennsylvania
Brewery. The remainder of the Companys products is brewed
under brewing service arrangements with other brewing companies.
Under the brewing service arrangements with other brewing
companies, the Company purchases the liquid produced by those
brewing companies, including the raw materials that are used in
the liquid, at the time such liquid goes into fermentation. The
Company is also required to repurchase from the supplier all
unused raw materials purchased by the supplier specifically for
its products at suppliers cost upon termination of these
production arrangements. The Company is also obligated to meet
annual volume requirements in conjunction with certain
production arrangements. During 2008, the Company did not meet
existing minimum volume requirements at three brewery locations.
For these breweries, the fees associated with not meeting
minimum volume requirements totaled approximately
$23million and have been recognized in the Companys
consolidated financial statements at December27, 2008. In
2009, the Company has minimum production commitments of
approximately $850,000 in aggregate with other brewing companies
which are expected to be achieved.   The Companys arrangements with other brewing companies
require it to periodically purchase fixed assets in support of
brewery operations. As of December27, 2008, there were no
significant fixed asset purchase requirements outstanding under
existing contracts. Changes to the Companys brewing
strategy or existing production arrangements, new production
relationships or introduction of new products in the future may
require the Company to purchase fixed assets to support the
contract breweries operations.   On November2, 2007, the Company entered into a Glass
Bottle Supply Agreement with Anchor Glass Container Corporation
Anchor that calls for Anchor to be the exclusive
supplier of glass bottles for the Companys Cincinnati
Brewery and Pennsylvania Brewery, beginning January1,
2009. The agreement also establishes the terms on which Anchor
may supply glass bottles to other breweries where the Company
brews its beers. Based on the agreement, the Company has minimum
and maximum purchase commitments based on provided production
estimates which are expected to be fulfilled within the provided
range.   Lease
Commitments   The Company has various operating lease agreements in place for
facilities and equipment as of December27, 2008. Terms of
these leases include, in some instances, scheduled rent
increases, renewals, purchase options, and maintenance costs,
and vary by lease. These lease obligations expire at various
dates through 2019. Aggregate rent expense was
$13million, $08million and $14million in
fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   Aggregate minimum annual rental payments under these agreements

Excise Tax Liability   During the third quarter of 2007, the TTB performed a routine
audit of the Companys Cincinnati Brewery and other
breweries where some of the Companys products are produced
the TTB Audit. In February 2008, the TTB formally
disputed the Companys regulatory and tax treatment of
certain of its 2006 and 2007 Twisted
Tea
shipments and issued a notice of demand to the Company for
additional excise taxes plus interest and penalties of
approximately $85million. The TTB asserted that these
shipments were not classified consistent with TTB regulations
that took effect January1, 2006. The Company disputed this
assessment and, based on the information previously collected
and its earlier assessment of likely outcomes, the Company
recorded a provision of $39million in the third quarter
of 2007. In the third quarter of 2008, the Company made an offer
of settlement and paid the TTB the sum of $37million. In
the first quarter of 2009, the Company and the TTB reached a
final settlement and no additional funds are due.   Packaging
Services Agreement   In connection with the Companys acquisition of the
Pennsylvania Brewery, Diageo and the Company entered into a
Packaging Services Agreement dated August1, 2007 the
Packaging Services Agreement, pursuant to which the
Company agreed to blend and package the Diageo products that
were being produced at the Pennsylvania Brewery by Diageo. The
Packaging Services Agreement commenced on June2, 2008, the
date on which the Company purchased the Pennsylvania Brewery,
and called for a term of approximately two years, subject to
certain early termination rights. Similar to contracts that the
Company has historically entered into to meet its supply needs,
the agreement provides for guaranteed service capacity and
production service for producing Diageo products which includes
labor, machinery and warehouse space; however, there are no
minimum volume guarantees by Diageo and the capacity commitment
by the Company will decline over the term of the agreement.   On November19, 2008, the Company received notice from
Diageo that it will be terminating the Packaging Service
Agreement, as amended. The termination is effective at the
conclusion of the second phase of the Packaging Services
Agreement on May2, 2009. No early termination penalties
will apply.   During fiscal 2008, the Company recorded $78million in
revenue based upon units produced. The Company has
$21million in deferred revenue related to advance
payments under the Packaging Services Agreement.   Litigation   The Company is considering pursuing a claim against the
manufacturer of the glass bottles that were subject to a product
recall in 2008. While the Company is not aware of any basis for
a claim or counter-claim against it by the manufacturer in
connection with this matter, such a possibility exists. In such
event, there is the risk that the recovery by the manufacturer
on its claims could exceed the Companys recovery on its
claims. In addition, when formal proceedings are initiated,
substantial legal and related costs are possible, which, if not
recovered, could have a materially adverse impact on the
Companys financial results. At this time, since no formal
claim has been made, it is not possible to assess the risk of a
successful counter-claim or the probable cost of such litigation.   The Company is not a party to any other pending or threatened
litigation, the outcome of which would be expected to have a
material adverse effect upon its financial condition or the
results of its operations. In general, while the Company
believes it conducts its business appropriately in accordance
with laws, regulations and industry guidelines, claims, whether
or not meritorious, could be asserted against the Company that
might adversely impact the Companys results.

Product
Recall   On April7, 2008, the Company announced a voluntary product
recall of certain glass bottles of its Samuel
Adams
products. The recall was a precautionary step and resulted from
routine quality control inspections at the Cincinnati Brewery,
which detected glass inclusions in certain bottles of beer. The
bottles were from a single glass plant of the supplier that
supplied bottles to the Company. The glass plant in question
supplied approximately 25% of the Companys glass bottles
during the first quarter of 2008.   Through the twelve months ended December27, 2008, the
Company recorded an estimated accrual for product returns of
$132million, net of estimated excise tax credits of
$11million, and an estimated accrual for recall-related
costs of $63million, and wrote-off $32million of
affected inventory. The estimated returns have been recorded as
a reduction of revenue and the costs of the recall and the
inventory write-off have been included in cost of goods sold,
since substantially all of the costs incurred are a direct
result of the packaging defect. For the fiscal year ended
December27, 2008, the recorded recall charges resulted in
a total reduction to operating income and income before income
taxes of $227million and a reduction to net income of
$120million.   The following table summarizes the Companys reserves and

wholesale, and sale prices of relevant products. Such estimates
are based on actual returns and information of remaining cases
to be returned provided by distributors that are available to
the Company as of December27, 2008. The recall-related
costs primarily include fees and incentives to wholesalers for
their effort to return the products, freight and destruction
charges for returned products, warehouse and inspection fees,
repackaging materials, point-of-sale materials and other costs.
These costs are calculated based upon the estimated number of
affected bottles, the Companys historical costs for
various activities such as freight, destruction and warehousing,
agreed upon incentives with retailers and wholesalers and costs
incurred to date. The Company has completed the process of
collecting cases of suspected product. The Company expects to
complete payment of the remaining direct costs related to the
recall within the next three months.

Stock Compensation Plan   The Companys Employee Equity Incentive Plan the
Equity Plan currently provides for the grant of
discretionary options and restricted stock awards to employees,
and provides for shares to be sold to employees of the Company
at a discounted purchase price under its investment share
program. The Equity Plan is administered by the Board of
Directors of the Company, based on recommendations received from
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The
Compensation Committee consists of three independent directors.
In determining the quantities and types of awards for grant, the
Compensation Committee periodically reviews the objectives of
the Companys compensation system and takes into account
the position and responsibilities of the employee being
considered, the nature and value to the Company of his or her
service and accomplishments, his or her present and potential
contributions to the success of the Company, the value of the
type of awards to the employee and such other factors as the
Compensation Committee deems relevant.   Stock options and related vesting requirements and terms are
granted at the Board of Directors discretion, but
generally vest ratably over five-year periods and, with respect
to certain options granted to members of senior management,
based on the Companys performance. Generally, the maximum
contractual term of stock options is ten years, although the
Board of Directors may grant options that exceed the ten-year
term. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company granted
options to purchase 839,364, 336,100 and 94,000shares,
respectively, of its ClassA Common Stock to employees at
market price on the grant dates. The 2008 option grants consist
of a service-based option to purchase 753,864shares that
vest at the end of a ten-year period and an aggregate of 85,500
performance-based options. The 2007 option grants consist of a
service-based option to purchase 180,000shares that vest
at the end of a six-year period and an aggregate of 156,100
performance-based options. All 2006 option grants are
performance-based options. The number of shares that will vest
under the performance-based options depends on the level of
performance targets attained on various dates.   Restricted stock awards are also granted at the Board of
Directors discretion. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
the Company granted 35,713, 40,013 and 32,079shares,
respectively, of restricted stock awards to certain senior
managers and key employees, which vest ratably over service
periods of five years. During fiscal 2007, the Company granted
an additional 3,195shares of performance-based restricted
stock awards to certain key employees that did not vest as
performance targets were not attained and were cancelled in
fiscal 2008.   The Equity Plan also has an investment share program which
permits employees who have been with the Company for at least
one year to purchase shares of ClassA Common Stock at a

Option Grants to Chief Executive Officer   On January1, 2008, the Company granted the Chief Executive
Officer an option to purchase 753,864shares of its
ClassA Common Stock, which vests over a five-year period,
commencing on January1, 2014, at the rate of 20% per year.
The exercise price is determined by multiplying $4200 by the
aggregate change in the DJ Wilshire 5000 Index from and after
January1, 2008 through the close of business on the
trading date next preceding each date on which the option is
exercised. The exercise price will not be less than $3765 per
share and the excess of the fair value of the Companys
ClassA Common Stock cannot exceed $70 per share over the
exercise price. The Company is accounting for this award as a
market-based award which was valued utilizing the Monte Carlo
Simulation pricing model, which calculates multiple potential
outcomes for an award and establishes fair value based on the
most likely outcome. Under the Monte Carlo Simulation pricing
model the Company calculated the weighted average fair value per
share to be $841, and recorded stock-based compensation expense
of $07million related to this option in fiscal year 2008.   In August 2007, the Company granted an option to purchase
180,000shares of its ClassA Common Stock to its
Chief Executive Officer that cliff-vest after completion of a
six-year service period. Under the binomial option-pricing
model, the weighted average fair value of the option is $1939
per share, and the Company recorded stock-based compensation
expense of $05million and $02million related to
this stock option in fiscal year 2008 and 2007, respectively.   Stock-Based
Compensation   The following table provides information regarding stock-based
compensation expense included in operating expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income, since the

2006 using the modified-prospective transition method.
Consequently, prior period financial statements have not been
restated to reflect the effect of SFASNo123R. The
effect of the adoption of SFASNo123R was a decrease
in income before provision for income taxes by $07million
and a decrease in net income by $04million, or $003 per
basic and diluted common share, in fiscal 2006.   For stock options granted prior to the adoption of
SFASNo123R on January1, 2006, fair values
were estimated on the date of grants using a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. As permitted by SFASNo123R,
the Company elected to use a lattice model, such as the binomial
option-pricing model, to estimate the fair values of stock
options granted on or after January1, 2006. The Company
believes that the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is less
effective than the binomial option-pricing model in valuing
long-term options, as it assumes that volatility and interest
rates are constant over the life of the option. In addition, the
Company believes that the binomial option-pricing model more
accurately reflects the fair value of its stock awards, as it
takes into account historical employee exercise patterns based
on changes in the Companys stock price and other relevant
variables. The weighted-average fair value of stock options
granted during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $1384, $1595 and $843
per share, respectively, as calculated using a binomial
option-pricing model.

Options to purchase 753,864shares of the Companys
ClassA Common Stock were granted to the Chief Executive
Officer and accounted for as a market-based award utilizing the
Monte Carlo Simulation pricing model.   Expected volatility is based on the Companys historical
realized volatility. The risk-free interest rate represents the
implied yields available from the U.S.Treasury zero-coupon
yield curve over the contractual term of the option when using
the binomial. Expected dividend yield is 0% because the Company
has not paid dividends in the past and currently has no known
intention to do so in the future. Exercise factor and discount
for post-vesting restrictions are based on the Companys
historical experience.   Fair value of investment shares was calculated using the same
methods as those used to calculate the fair value of stock
options in the respective financial statement periods. Fair
value of restricted stock awards was based on the Companys
traded stock price on the date of the grants.   The Company uses the straight-line attribution method in
recognizing stock-based compensation expense for awards that
vest based on service conditions. For awards that vest subject
to performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized
ratably for each tranche of the award over the performance
period if it is probable that performance conditions will be met.   Under SFASNo123R, compensation expense is
recognized less estimated forfeitures. Because most of the
Companys equity awards vest on January1steach
year, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense
related to those awards, net of actual forfeitures. For equity
awards that do not vest on January1st, the estimated
forfeiture rate used was 10%. The forfeiture rate was based upon
historical experience and the Company periodically reviews this
rate to ensure proper projection of future forfeitures.   The total fair value of options vested during 2008, 2007 and
2006 was $32million, $17million and
$14million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value
of stock options exercised during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Union
Plans   The Company has one Company-sponsored defined contribution plan
and four defined benefit plans, which combined cover
substantially all union employees. The defined benefit plans
include two union-sponsored collectively bargained
multi-employer pension plans, a Company-sponsored defined
benefit pension plan and a Company-sponsored post-retirement
medical plan.   The Companys defined contribution plan, the Samuel Adams
Brewery Company, Ltd. 401k Plan for Represented Employees, was
established by the Company in 1997 and is available to all union
employees upon completion of one hour of full-time employment.
Participants may make voluntary contributions up to 60% of their
annual compensation to the Samuel Adams Brewery Company, Ltd.
401k Plan, subject to IRS limitations. Effective April1,
2007, the Company makes a non-elective contribution for certain
bargaining employees who are members of a specific union.
Company contributions were insignificant. The Company also
incurs insignificant administration costs for the plan.   The union-sponsored benefit plans are two multi-employer
retirement plans administrated by organized labor unions.
Information from the plans administrators is not
sufficient to permit the Company to determine its share, if any,
of the unfunded benefits. Pension expense and employer
contributions for these multi-employer plans were not
significant in the aggregate.   The Company-sponsored defined benefit pension plan, The Local
Union#1199 Defined Benefit Pension Plan the Local
1199 Plan, was established in 1991 and is eligible to all
union employees who are covered by the Companys collective
bargaining agreement and have completed twelve consecutive
months of employment with at least 750hours worked. The
defined benefit is determined based on years of service since
July 1991. The Company made combined contributions of $27,000,
$02million and $01million to this plan in fiscal
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December27, 2008 and
December29, 2007, the unfunded projected pension benefits
were not material to the Companys financial statements.   A comprehensive medical plan is offered to union employees who
have voluntarily retired at the age of 65 or have become
permanently disabled. Employees must have worked for the Company
or the prior owners for at least 10years at the
Companys Cincinnati Brewery, been enrolled in the
Companys medical insurance plan and be eligible for
Medicare benefits under the Social Security Act. The accumulated
post-retirement benefit obligation was determined using a
discount rate of 60% at September30, 2008 and 2007, and a
25% increase in the Cincinnati Consumer Price Index for the
years then ended. The effect of a 1% point increase and the
effect of a 1% point decrease in the assumed health care cost
trend rates on the aggregate of the service and interest cost
components of net periodic postretirement health care benefit
costs and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for
health care benefits were not significant.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo158,
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of FASB Statements
No87, 88, 106 and 132R, which applies to all plan
sponsors who offer defined benefit postretirement plans.
SFASNo158 requires recognition of the funded status
of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the statement of
financial position and expanded disclosures in the notes to
financial statements. The Company adopted this provision for the
year ended December30, 2006 and the adoption did not have
a material impact on its consolidated financial position. In
addition, SFASNo158 requires measurement of plan
assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the plan
sponsors fiscal year end. As required, the Company adopted
the measurement provision of SFASNo158 for its
fiscal year ended December27, 2008 which did not have a
material effect on its 2008 consolidated financial position,
operations and cash flows.

objectives vary and include maximizing long-term returns both
before and after taxes, maximizing total return from capital
appreciation plus income and funds that invest in common stock
of companies that cover a broad range of industries.   The basis of the long-term rate of return assumption reflects
the Local 1199 Plans current asset mix of approximately
40% debt securities and 60% equity securities with assumed
average annual returns of approximately 5% to 6% for debt
securities and 10% to 12% for equity securities. It is assumed
that the Local 1199 Plans investment portfolio will be
adjusted periodically to maintain the current ratios of debt
securities and equity securities. Additional consideration is

of disclosure controls and procedures   The Companys management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective

Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting   The management of the Company is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f.
The Companys internal control system was designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management
and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements.   The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December27, 2008. In making this assessment, the Company
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control Integrated Framework. Based on its
assessment the Company believes that, as of December27,
2008, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   
69 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   The Board of Directors and Stockholders of the Boston Beer
Company, Inc.   We have audited The Boston Beer Company Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of December27, 2008,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria.
The Boston Beer Company Inc.s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying managements report on internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, The Boston Beer Company, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December27, 2008, based on the COSO
criteria.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of the Boston Beer Company, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December27, 2008 and December29,
2007, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December27, 2008, and our report
dated March6, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.   /s/Ernst
