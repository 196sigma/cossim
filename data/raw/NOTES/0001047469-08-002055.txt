Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc.      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007    
1.The Company 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Millennium or the Company is an innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and
commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients with cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases and other inflammatory diseases. The Company currently commercializes VELCADE, the global market
leader for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and the United States market leader for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma patients who have
received at least one prior therapy. The Company is also awaiting a decision from the Food and Drug Administration FDA to market VELCADE for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The
Company has a development pipeline of clinical and preclinical product candidates in its therapeutic focus areas of cancer and inflammatory diseases. The Company has an oncology-focused drug discovery
organization. Strategic business relationships are a key component of the Company business to maximize the global potential of its products and product candidates. Millennium
strategy is to build a portfolio of new medicines based on its understanding of genomics and protein homeostasis, which is a set of particular molecular pathways that affect
the establishment
and progression of diseases. These molecular pathways include the related effects of proteins on cellular performance, reproduction and death. The Company plans to develop and commercialize many of
its products on its own, but expects to seek development and commercial collaborators on favorable terms or when it believes that doing so would be advantageous to the Company. 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Millennium and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. 
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Reclassifications 
Certain prior year consolidated statements of operations amounts have been reclassified between research and development and selling, general and administrative
expenses to conform to the current year presentation. This reclassification does not have a material impact on previously reported research and development and selling, general and administrative
expenses and has no impact on previously reported net loss from operations. 
Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Other Investments 
Cash equivalents principally consist of money market funds and corporate bonds with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Marketable
securities primarily consist of investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed debt securities and U.S. government agency debt securities. Other investments represent ownership in private companies in
which the Company holds less than a 
66 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued 20percent
ownership position and does not otherwise exercise significant influence. The Company carries such investments at cost unless significant influence can be exercised over the
investee, in which case such securities are recorded using the equity method. The Company monitors these investments in private companies on a quarterly basis and determines whether any impairment in
their value would require a charge to the statement of operations, based on the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee, market prices of comparable public
companies and general market conditions. These other investments are included in other assets and aggregate $93million and $89million at December31, 2007 and
December31, 2006, respectively. 
Management
determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. Marketable securities
at December31, 2007 and December31, 2006 are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity. The cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in investment income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities and other investments are included in investment income. The cost of securities sold is based on
the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in investment income. 
During
the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded realized gains on marketable securities and other investments of $96million 31million and $01million, respectively, and realized losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on marketable securities and other
investments of $50million, $53million and $36million, respectively. Realized
gains on marketable securities for the year ended December31, 2007 and 2006 included a realized gain of approximately $23million and $31million,
respectively, related to the Company share of proceeds from a class action proceeding against WorldCom,Inc. The Company had previously recorded realized losses equal to the carrying value of
its investment in WorldCom,Inc., as the decline in value was determined to be other-than-temporary at that time. 
During
the year ended December31, 2005, the Company recorded a realized gain of approximately $105million from the sale of its cost method investment in TransForm
Pharmaceuticals,Inc. TransForm. In October 2006, the Company recorded an additional realized gain of $29million upon the final settlement and receipt of the escrowed portion of
the sale proceeds. TransForm, a company specializing in the discovery of formulations and novel crystalline forms of drug molecules, was acquired by Johnson Johnson in a
cash-for-stock transaction that closed in April 2005. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with two major financial institutions in the United States. Deposits with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of marketable securities and accounts receivable. Marketable securities consist of investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed and U.S. government
agency securities. The Company investment policy, approved by the Board of Directors, limits the amount the Company may invest in any one type of investment and, in certain cases, in any one issuer,
thereby reducing credit risk concentrations. Accounts receivable includes trade receivables which result from product sales to a sole distributor and 
67 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued amounts
due under strategic alliances. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivables is limited by ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. 
Segment Information 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS
No131, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in their financial statements. SFAS No131 also establishes
standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The
Company operates in one business segment, which focuses on the research, development and commercialization of therapeutic products. All of the Company product sales are currently
related to sales of VELCADE bortezomib for Injection. All of the Company co-promotion revenue reported in prior periods was related to sales and development of
INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection through August31, 2005. The remainder of the Company total revenue is related to its strategic alliances and royalties. 
Revenues
from Ortho Biotech Products,L.P. OBL, a member of The Johnson Johnson Family Of Companies, accounted for approximately 25percent,
22percent and 10percent of consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenues
from Schering-PloughLtd. and Schering Corporation collectively SGP, excluding co-promotion revenue, related to the sale of INTEGRILIN, accounted for
approximately 20percent, 27percent and 24percent of consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
There
were no other significant customers under strategic alliances and royalties in 2007, 2006 and 2005. 
Information Concerning Market and Source of Supply Concentration 
The Company relies on third party contract manufacturers for the manufacturing, fill/finish and packaging of VELCADE for both commercial purposes and for ongoing
clinical trials. The Company has established long term supply relationships for the production of commercial supplies of VELCADE. The Company works with one manufacturer under a long term supply
agreement to complete fill/finish for VELCADE. The Company is currently qualifying a second fill/finish supplier in order to mitigate its risk of VELCADE supply interruption. 
The
Company distributes VELCADE in the United States through a sole-source open access distribution model where the Company sells directly to an independent third party who
in turn distributes to the wholesaler base. In April 2006, the Company distributor added a second distribution site to its network in order to improve access to the product for physicians in the
western United States. 
INTEGRILIN
has received regulatory approvals in the United States, the countries of the European Union and a number of other countries for various indications. The Company and SGP
co-promoted INTEGRILIN in the United States and shared any profits and losses through August31, 2005. In September 2005, SGP acquired the exclusive development and
commercialization rights to INTEGRILIN in the United States from the Company. In the European Union, GlaxoSmithKlineplc GSK exclusively markets INTEGRILIN. The Company continues to manage
the supply chain for 
68 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued INTEGRILIN
at the expense of SGP for products sold in the SGP territories, and at the expense of GSK in the GSK territory. 
The
Company relies on third party contract manufacturers for the clinical and commercial production of INTEGRILIN. The Company has three approved manufacturers, two of which currently
provide the Company with eptifibatide, the active pharmaceutical ingredient API necessary to make INTEGRILIN, for both clinical trials and commercial supply. Solvay,S.A., one of the
current manufacturers, owns the process technology used by it and one other manufacturer for the production of the API. In June 2006, the Company received FDA approval of its own alternative process
technology utilized by the second manufacturer for the production of eptifibatide for approval in the United States. The European Medicines Agency approved the alternate process technology for
eptifibatide in June 2007. The Company has two manufacturers that currently perform fill/finish services for INTEGRILIN and two packaging suppliers for INTEGRILIN for the United States. The FDA or
other regulatory agencies must approve the processes or the facilities that may be used for the manufacture of the Company marketed products. 
Inventory 
Inventory consists of currently marketed products, including VELCADE and INTEGRILIN. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in, first out or market.
Inventories are reviewed periodically for slow-moving or obsolete status based on sales activity, both projected and historical. 
VELCADE
inventories primarily relate to raw materials used in production, work in process and finished goods inventory on hand. INTEGRILIN inventories include raw materials used in
production and work in process to supply GSK and limited amounts of work in process to supply SGP. 
Inventory

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Assets held under capitalized leases are stated at the present value of future minimum lease obligations. Application
development costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position SOP No98-1, Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are amortized over the shorter of the remaining life of the building lease or useful life.
Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease as follows: Equipment

Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Intangible assets consist of specifically identified intangible assets. Goodwill is the excess of any purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net
tangible assets acquired not allocated to specific intangible assets.

expense was approximately $340million in each of the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. The Company expects to incur amortization expense of
approximately $340million for each of the next five years. 
As
required by SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed annually for impairment,
or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances suggest that the assets may not be recoverable. The Company tests for goodwill impairment annually, on October1, and whenever events or changes in
circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
On
October1, 2007, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed on that date. The Company continually monitors business and
market conditions, including the restructured relationship with SGP, to assess whether an impairment indicator exists. If the Company were to determine that an impairment indicator exists, it would be
required to perform an impairment test, which might result in a material impairment charge to the statement of operations. Goodwill
as of December31, 2007 consists of the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets. The carrying value may be adjusted as a
result of the continued settlement of contingent consideration arising from acquisitions. Accordingly, goodwill

Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued increased
by $36million and $30million for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying amounts reported in the Company balance sheets for current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value. The estimated fair value as
of December31, 2007 of the Company 225% convertible senior notes due November15, 2011 the 225% notes was $2941million based on quoted market values. Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, its co-promotion collaboration through August31, 2005, strategic alliances and
royalties. The Company revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has
stand-alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units
based on their respective fair values, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified
as deferred revenue until earned. 
Net product sales 
The Company records product sales of VELCADE when delivery has occurred, title has transferred, collection is reasonably assured and the Company has no further
obligations. Allowances are recorded as a reduction to product sales for discounts, product returns and governmental and contractual adjustments at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for
shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales. 
Co-promotion revenue 
Through August31, 2005, co-promotion revenue included the Company share of profits from the sale of INTEGRILIN in co-promotion
territories by SGP. Also included in co-promotion revenue were reimbursements from SGP of the Company manufacturing-related costs, development costs, advertising and promotional expenses
associated with the sale of INTEGRILIN within co-promotion territories and royalties from SGP on sales of INTEGRILIN outside of the co-promotion territory other than Europe.
The Company recognized revenue when SGP shipped INTEGRILIN to wholesalers and recorded it net of allowances, if any. The Company deferred specified manufacturing-related expenses until the time SGP
shipped related product to its customers inside and outside of co-promotion territories and outside of Europe.

September1, 2005 as a result of the Company transition from a co-promotion to a royalty arrangement for INTEGRILIN in the United States, the Company no
longer reports co-promotion revenue. 
Revenue under strategic alliances 
The Company recognizes revenue under strategic alliances from nonrefundable license payments, milestone payments, reimbursement of research and development costs
and reimbursement of manufacturing-related costs. Nonrefundable upfront fees for which no further performance obligations exist are recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received
or collection is assured.

Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued 
Nonrefundable
upfront licensing fees and guaranteed, time-based payments that require continuing involvement in the form of research and development, manufacturing or other
commercialization efforts by the Company are recognized as revenue: ratably
over the development period if development risk is significant;
ratably
over the manufacturing period or estimated product useful life if development risk has been substantially eliminated; or
based
upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract. Milestone
payments are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations, as defined in the contract, are achieved. Performance obligations typically consist of significant
milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology or product candidate, such as initiation of clinical trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory
agencies. 
Reimbursements
of research and development costs are recognized as revenue as the related costs are incurred. 
Royalties 
Royalties are recognized as revenue when earned. Royalties may include: royalties
earned on sales of INTEGRILIN in the United States and other territories around the world, as provided by SGP;
royalties,
or distribution fees, earned on international sales of VELCADE, as provided by OBL;
royalties
earned on sales of INTEGRILIN in Europe, as provided by GSK; and
other
royalties. Advertising and Promotional Expenses 
Advertising and promotional expenses are expensed as incurred. During the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, advertising and promotional
expenses were $431million, $232million and $358million, respectively. Amounts recorded in 2005 include advertising and promotional expenses related to INTEGRILIN. 
Other Income 
In July 2006, the Company recognized a deferred gain of $34million upon receipt of proceeds from the sale of assets to Gene Logic,Inc., which was
included in other income for the year ended December31, 2006. 
In
September 2006, the Company entered into a support agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of AnorMED,Inc. Subsequent to executing the support agreement, AnorMED received a
more favorable acquisition offer from Genzyme Corporation and terminated the initial support agreement with the Company. As a result of the termination of the support agreement, the Company received a
$195million termination fee from AnorMED in October 2006, which was included in other income for the year ended December31, 2006. Transaction costs associated with the attempted
acquisition of approximately $55million were included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December31, 2006.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued  Income Taxes 
The liability method, in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFASNo109, is used to account for income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets, representing future tax benefits, are reduced by a
valuation allowance to reflect uncertainty when it is more likely than not that the related tax asset will not be realized. If it is determined at a later date that these deferred tax assets may
become realizable, it would result in a reversal of some or all of the valuation allowance recorded against these assets. This would result in a corresponding tax benefit in the Company results of
operation, which could be material. 
Effective
January1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No48 FIN48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of
FASB109 the Interpretation. The Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS
No109. The Interpretation proscribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on
derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adoption did not have a material impact on its results of
operations or financial position as it did not recognize any assets or liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relative to uncertain tax positions upon adoption of the Interpretation. The adoption
resulted in the net derecognition of approximately $337million of deferred tax assets from tax credit carryforwards which was offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance on the deferred
tax assets. 
Earnings Loss Per Common Share 
Basic earnings loss per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding restricted stock
that has been issued but is not yet vested. Diluted earnings loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus additional weighted average
common equivalent shares outstanding during the period when the effect is not anti-dilutive. Common equivalent shares result from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and
warrants the proceeds of which are then assumed to have been used to repurchase outstanding stock using the treasury stock method, the assumed conversion of convertible notes and the vesting of
unvested restricted shares of common stock. Common equivalent shares from options, warrants, unvested restricted shares and the assumed conversion of convertible notes that were not included in the
calculation of diluted shares because the effect would have been anti-dilutive were 317million, 394million and 277million at December31,

the quarter ended December31, 2007, the assumed conversion of convertible notes into 162million shares of common stock has a dilutive effect resulting in a dilutive
income adjustment of $18million in the calculation of the quarterly earnings per share included in Note13. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The financial statements of the Company foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency, with results of operations and
cash flows translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities translated at end of period exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in
the results of operations and are not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. Translation adjustments are excluded from the determination of net income loss and are presented in
a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders' equity. 
Comprehensive Income Loss 
Comprehensive income loss comprises net income loss, changes in unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities and cumulative foreign currency
translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of December31, 2007 and 2006 included unrealized gains of $49million and unrealized losses of
$04million, respectively, on marketable securities and $10 million and $09 million, respectively, of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income loss is
reflected in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. 
Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
As discussed more fully in Note10, the Company adopted SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share Based Payment SFAS123R effective
January1, 2006 under the modified prospective transition method of adoption. SFAS123R requires the recognition of the fair value of stock-based compensation in its statements of
operations. Stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to stock options, restricted stock and stock issued under the Company employee stock purchase plans. 
74 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued Prior
to January1, 2006, the Company followed Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB25 and related
interpretations, in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Under APB25, when the exercise price of the employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of grant, no stock-based compensation expense was recognized. The Company elected the modified prospective transition method for adopting SFAS123R. Under this method, the provisions of
SFAS123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption, determined under the
original provisions of SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS123, is being recognized in the Company statements of operations in the periods after the date of
adoption. For stock options granted prior to January1, 2006, the Company calculated stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for
each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. For restricted stock granted prior to January1, 2006, the Company calculated stock-based
compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award. 
SFAS123
and 123R require the presentation of pro forma information for periods prior to adoption as if the Company had accounted for all stock-based employee compensation expense
under the fair value
method of those statements. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the stock options at the date of the grant is amortized to expense on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions to stock-based employee compensation expense in thousands,

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements, SFASNo157. SFAS No157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No157 codifies the
definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, clarifies
the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that 
75 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued prioritizes
the information used to develop those assumptions. SFAS No157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007. The Company does not believe that adoption
will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, SFAS159. SFAS159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in
reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November15, 2007. The Company is currently analyzing the effect, if any, SFAS159 will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
In
June 2007, the FASB issued EITF No07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development
Activities, EITF07-3. EITF07-3 requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and
development activities should be deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. EITF07-3 is
effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007. The Company is currently analyzing the effect, if any, EITF07-3 will have on
its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
In
December 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements, EITF07-1. EITF07-1 requires
collaborators to present the results of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable
GAAP or, in the absence of other applicable GAAP, based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable, rational, and consistently applied accounting policy election. Further,
EITF07-1 clarified the determination of whether transactions within a collaborative arrangement are part of a vendor-customer or analogous relationship subject to
EITF01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer Including a
Reseller of the Vendor Products. EITF07-1 will be effective for the Company beginning on January1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the effect
EITF07-1 will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
3.Restructuring  2006 Resource Alignment 
In October 2006, the Company announced a program to further align resources with its current corporate priorities of advancing VELCADE and accelerating the
clinical and preclinical pipeline by lowering investment in discovery and supporting areas. As part of its program, the Company has reduced in-house research and development technologies
and headcount in areas where the work can now be outsourced. 
The
Company recorded restructuring charges of approximately $172million during the year ended December31, 2007 under the 2006 restructuring program primarily for
additional facility-related costs associated with vacated buildings and employee termination benefits as a result of headcount reductions. Other in the table below includes the write-off
of deferred rent in accordance with SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases, upon vacating the facilities. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company recorded restructuring
charges of approximately $52million under the 2006

In October 2005, the Company announced its 2005 restructuring plan in support of a refined business strategy focused on advancing key growth assets, including
VELCADE, advancing the Company clinical pipeline and building a leading oncology-focused discovery organization. In connection with the strategic refinement, the Company substantially reduced its
effort in inflammation discovery and reduced overall headcount, including eliminating positions in INTEGRILIN sales and marketing, inflammation discovery and various other business support groups. The
Company recorded net restructuring credits of approximately $38million during the year ended December31, 2007 under the 2005 restructuring plan, primarily related to
the earlier than anticipated sublease of one of its facilities charged to restructuring in prior years at a higher rate per square foot than it had originally estimated. During the year ended
December31, 2006, the Company recorded restructuring charges under the Company 2005 restructuring plan of approximately $12million primarily for additional facility-related costs
associated with vacated buildings, changes in sublease assumptions of certain vacated buildings, and employee termination benefits as a result of headcount reductions within inflammation discovery and
business support groups, partially offset by a credit resulting from the earlier than anticipated sublease of one of the vacated buildings at a higher rate per square foot than the Company had
originally estimated.

In December 2002 and June 2003, the Company realigned its resources to become a commercially-focused biopharmaceutical company. The Company discontinued specified
discovery research efforts, reduced overall headcount, primarily in its discovery group, and consolidated its research and development facilities. 
During
the year ended December31, 2007, the Company recorded net restructuring credits under the Company 2003 restructuring plan of approximately $05million primarily
related to the earlier than anticipated sublease of one of its facilities charged to restructuring in prior years at a higher rate per square foot than it had originally estimated, as well as the
sublease extension for another facility charged to restructuring in prior years. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company recorded restructuring charges under the Company 2003
restructuring plan of approximately $140million primarily related to the lease termination payment for its vacated facility in Cambridge, England.

Company accounts for its restructuring charges in accordance with SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS No146.
SFAS No146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is
incurred, except for one-time termination benefits that meet specified requirements. Costs of termination benefits relate to severance packages,
out-placement services and career counseling for employees affected by the restructuring.

Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued 
In
accordance with SFAS No146, the Company facilities related expenses and liabilities in all restructuring plans include estimates of the remaining rental obligations, net of
estimated sublease income, for facilities the Company no longer occupies. The Company reviews its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis, until the outcome is finalized, and makes whatever
modifications are necessary, based on the Company best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances. 
The
Company decisions to vacate specified facilities and abandon the related leasehold improvements as well as terminate specified research programs were deemed to be impairment
indicators under SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. As a result of performing the impairment evaluations, asset impairment charges were
recorded to adjust the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to their net realizable values. The fair values of the assets were estimated based upon anticipated future cash
flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. These amounts are included in asset impairment in the above tables. 
In
connection with its 2006 decision to abandon certain facilities in 2007 under the 2006 restructuring program, the Company shortened the useful lives of the leasehold improvements at
these facilities in accordance with SFAS No144. During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded additional depreciation expense of approximately
$33million and $38million, respectively, in research and development expense related to its decision. The
projected timing of payments of the remaining restructuring liabilities under all of the Company restructuring initiatives at December31, 2007 is approximately
$230million in 2008 and $264million thereafter through 2014. The actual amount and timing of the payment of the remaining accrued liability is dependent upon the ultimate terms of
any potential subleases or lease restructuring. 
4.Revenue and Strategic Alliances 
The Company has entered into research, development, technology transfer and commercialization arrangements with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
relating to a broad range of therapeutic products. These alliances provide the Company with the opportunity to receive various combinations of license fees, research funding, distribution fees and may
provide additional payments
contingent upon its achievement of research and regulatory milestones and royalties and/or profit shares if the Company collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products. 
Product Alliances 
VELCADE 
On June30, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with OBL to collaborate on the commercialization and with Johnson Johnson Pharmaceutical
Research Development, L.L.C., or JJPRD, to continue clinical development of VELCADE. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company retains all commercialization rights to VELCADE in the
United States. OBL and its affiliate, Janssen-Cilag, have agreed to commercialize VELCADE outside of the United States. The Company is entitled to royalties in the form of distribution fees from OBL
and its affiliate on sales of VELCADE outside of the United States. The Company also retains a limited option to co-promote VELCADE with OBL at a future date in specified European
countries. 
The
Company is engaged with JJPRD in an extensive global program for further clinical development of VELCADE with the purpose of maximizing the commercial potential of VELCADE. This
program is investigating the potential of VELCADE to treat multiple forms of solid and hematological cancers, including continued clinical development of VELCADE for multiple myeloma. 
79 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued JJPRD
was responsible for 40% of the joint development costs through 2005 and is currently responsible for 45% of those costs. The Company is responsible for the remaining 55% of the joint development
costs. 
The
Company may receive payments for achieving clinical development milestones, for achieving regulatory milestones outside of the United States and for achieving agreed-upon
sales levels of VELCADE outside of the United States. The Company may also receive additional payments for achieving specified clinical and regulatory approval milestones outside of the United States
for additional solid and hematological cancers and for achieving sales milestones outside of the United States. During the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized
approximately $400million, $480million and $220million, respectively, of milestone payments as revenue under this alliance. In
October 2006, the Company and Ortho BiotechInc. OBI announced a two-year agreement to jointly promote VELCADE in the U.S. Under the terms of the agreement, in
the first quarter of 2007, OBI and the Company began jointly promoting VELCADE to U.S.-based physicians. The Company pays a proportion of the VELCADE related costs for the OBI sales force, and OBI is
entitled to receive a commission should sales associated with the increased promotional effort exceed pre-specified targets. Both parties are able to terminate the agreement under certain
circumstances and subject to fees. The Company continues to be responsible for manufacturing and distribution of VELCADE in the U.S. The Company believes this collaboration, with the
well-established OBI oncology sales force, helps realize the full potential of the product. The current agreement between the Company and OBL for the promotion of VELCADE outside the U.S.
remains unchanged. 
INTEGRILIN 
In April 1999, COR entered into a collaboration agreement with SGP to jointly develop and commercialize INTEGRILIN on a worldwide basis. The Company acquired COR
in February 2002. Under its collaboration agreement with SGP, the Company generally shared any profits or losses from the sale of INTEGRILIN in the United States with SGP based on the amount of
promotional efforts that each party contributed. Since the United States launch of INTEGRILIN in June 1998, the Company and SGP had agreed to share promotional efforts in the United States equally,
except for costs associated with marketing programs that are specific to the Company. The Company had granted SGP an exclusive license to market INTEGRILIN outside of the United States and Europe and
SGP paid the Company royalties based on those sales. 
In
June 2004, the Company reacquired the rights to market INTEGRILIN in Europe from SGP and concurrently entered into a license agreement granting GSK exclusive marketing rights to
INTEGRILIN in Europe. In January 2005, the transition of the INTEGRILIN marketing authorization for the European Union from SGP to GSK was completed and GSK began selling INTEGRILIN in the countries
of the European Union. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is entitled to license fees and royalties from GSK on INTEGRILIN sales in Europe upon the achievement of specified objectives.
During the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized license fees of approximately $29million and $217million, respectively, included in strategic
alliance revenue from GSK. 
80   Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued 
On September1, 2005, the Company transferred to SGP the exclusive development and commercialization rights to INTEGRILIN in the United States. In exchange
for these rights, SGP paid the Company approximately $355million in a nonrefundable upfront payment that the Company is recognizing as revenue ratably over the Company period of involvement
in managing the supply chain. In addition, SGP is obligated to pay the Company royalties on product sales of INTEGRILIN over the lifetime of the product, with the potential of the Company receiving
royalties beyond the 2014 patent expiration date. 
As
of September1, 2005, the Company no longer records co-promotion revenue. The Company now records royalties on sales of INTEGRILIN in the United States and other
territories, as earned on a quarterly basis over the life of the INTEGRILIN product. Minimum royalty payments for 2006 and 2007 were approximately $854million. There are no guaranteed minimum
royalty payments for 2008 or future years. 
Upon
closing the amended collaboration agreement with SGP, the Company recognized strategic alliance revenue of approximately $714million in the third quarter of 2005 relating
to the Company sale to SGP of its existing raw materials and finished goods INTEGRILIN inventory. SGP assumed development obligations relating to the product. The Company continues to manage the
supply chain
for INTEGRILIN at the expense of SGP for products sold in the United States and other areas outside of the European Union. 5.Marketable Securities

loss position greater than one year have been in an unrealized loss position for less than two years. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate changes, and not credit quality
issues. To determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the Company demonstrates that it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price
recovery and, in doing so, considers evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable and outweighs evidence to the contrary. Since the decline in market value is primarily attributable
to changes in interest rates and the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value, the Company does not consider these investments to be
other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2007. 
The
unrealized losses on investments in United States government agency securities at December31, 2007 were primarily caused by interest rate changes. The contractual terms of
those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than amortized cost of the investment. Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments
until a recovery of fair value, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December31, 2007.

Lease Commitments 
The Company leases some of its laboratory and office space under operating lease agreements with various terms and renewal options, including major facilities
with lease expirations ranging from 2008 through 2020. In addition to minimum lease commitments, these lease agreements require the Company to pay its pro rata share of property taxes and building
operating expenses. 
On
August4, 2000, the Company entered into lease agreements, relating to two buildings for laboratory and office space in Cambridge, MA. The rent obligation for the first of
these buildings began in July 2002 and the rent obligation on the second building began in July 2003. The Company was responsible for a portion of the construction costs for both buildings and was
deemed to be the owner during the construction period of each building under EITF97-10, The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction. In July 2002 and July 2003, upon
completion of the construction period of the buildings, respectively, the Company recorded the leases as capital leases. Payments under these capital leases comprise principal, interest and rent
expense.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued 
In
November 2006, the Company completed the sale of $2500million of its 225% notes, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $2422million. The
225% notes are convertible into the Company common stock based upon a conversion rate of 646465 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 225% notes, which was equal to the
initial conversion price of approximately $1547 per
share of stock, subject to adjustment. The 225% notes are convertible only in the following circumstances: 1if the closing price of the common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price
within a specified period, 2if specified distributions to holders of the common stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur, 3if the average trading price per $1,000
principal amount is less than 98% of the product of the closing price of common stock and the then applicable conversion rate within a specified period or 4during the last three months prior
to the maturity date of the notes, unless previously repurchased by the Company under certain circumstances. The 225% notes are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured
debt of the Company. 
In
connection with the sale of the 225% notes, the Company paid approximately $78million in financing costs, which have been deferred and are included in other assets. These
deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense under the effective interest method over the life of the debt. The Company recognized $16million and $02million of
interest expense related to deferred financing cost amortization associated with the 225% notes during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Under
the terms of the 225% notes, the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance on May15 and November15
of each year. All required interest payments to date have been made. 
The
estimated fair value of the Company 225% notes as of December31, 2007 was $2941million based on quoted market values. 
In
accordance with the payment terms, the Company repaid the entire $833million principal balance on its 55% convertible subordinated notes due on January15, 2007 that
were convertible at a price equal to $4207 per share and the entire $162million principal balance on its 50% convertible subordinated notes due on March1, 2007 that were convertible
at a price equal to $3421 per share. 
10.Stockholders' Equity 
Preferred Stock 
The Company has 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, $0001 par value, issuable in one or more series, each of such series to have such rights and
preferences, including voting rights, dividend
rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. 
Common Stock 
At December31, 2007, the Company had 500,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, $0001 par value, with 324,605,075 shares issued and outstanding. 
Common Stock Warrants 
During the year ended December31, 2007, warrants to purchase 429,600 shares of common stock were exercised with a weighted-average exercise price of $944
per share. There are no outstanding warrants at December31, 2007.

Stock Option Plans 
As discussed in Note2, the Company adopted SFAS123R effective January1, 2006. Stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to stock
options, restricted stock and stock issued under the Company employee stock purchase plans. The Company policy is to grant stock options to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market
value of the Company stock at the dates of grant. Generally, options have a contractual term of ten years and vest monthly over a four-year period from grant date, although certain
options have been, and may in the future, be granted with shorter vesting periods. Certain of the Company option plans provide for full vesting of options issued under the plans to optionholders who
terminate their employment for good reason or are terminated without cause within the period one month before and one year after a change of control. Options granted to consultants and other
nonemployees generally vest over the period of service to the Company. Awards of restricted stock are granted to officers and certain employees and generally fully vest four years from the grant date,
although certain awards have been, and may in the future, be granted with shorter vesting periods. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. Restricted stock awards are
recorded as stock-based compensation expense, based on the market value on the date of the grant, on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The Company provides newly issued shares to satisfy stock option
exercises, the issuance of restricted stock and stock issued under the Company employee stock purchase plans. As
a result of the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company net loss for the year ended December31, 2006 was $421million, or $013 per basic and diluted share,
greater than if it had continued to account for share-based compensation related to stock options and the Company employee stock purchase plan under APB25. 
In
connection with the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company reassessed its valuation methodology for stock options and the related input assumptions. The assessment of the valuation
methodology resulted in the continued use of the Black-Scholes model. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company considered implied volatilities of currently traded options to provide an estimate of
volatility based upon current trading activity. After considering other factors such as its stage of development, the length of time the Company has been public and the impact of having a marketed
product, the Company concluded that a blended volatility rate based upon historical performance, as well as the implied volatilities of currently traded options, better reflects the expected
volatility of its stock going forward. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior, adjusted for known trends, to arrive at the estimated expected
life of an option. The Company updates its assumptions on a quarterly basis to reflect recent historical data. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the
option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
The
following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions the Company used in its fair value calculations at the date of grant: Stock Options

The
Company has never declared cash dividends on any of its capital stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. SFAS123R
requires the application of an estimated forfeiture rate to current period expense to recognize stock-based compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest.
The Company estimates forfeitures based upon historical data, adjusted for known trends, and will adjust its estimate of forfeitures if actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ from such
estimates. Subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense in
future periods. 
The
Company has various stock options plans for employees, officers and directors of the Company. During 2007, the Company 2007 Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan was approved to allow
for the granting of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards and other stock-based awards, including the grant of shares based upon specified conditions, the grant of
securities convertible into common stock and the grant of stock appreciation rights of up to 25,000,000 shares of common stock. At December31, 2007, 520,278 shares of common stock have been
reserved for the exercise of options outstanding, 40,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the vesting of restricted stock units and 24,295,537 shares of common stock are available for
future grant under the 2007 Plan. The purpose of the 2007 Plan was to consolidate, conform and replace all of the Company existing equity plans under which there were shares available for grant. The
Company 1993 Incentive Stock Plan the 1993 Plan, 1996 Equity Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan, and 1997 Equity Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan, allowed for the granting of
incentive and nonstatutory stock options for purchase of common stock of up to 21,600,000, 22,400,000, and 16,000,000 options, respectively. The Company 2000 Incentive Stock Plan the 2000 Plan
allowed for the granting of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards and other stock-
based awards, including the grant of shares based upon specified conditions, the grant of securities convertible into common stock and the grant of stock appreciation rights of up to 45,607,706 shares
of common stock. At December31, 2007, a total of 61,977, 568,788, 760,549 and 17,601,788 shares of common stock have been reserved for exercise of options outstanding under the 1993, 1996,
1997 and 2000 Plans, respectively. No options are available for future grant under the 1993, 1996, 1997 and 2000 Plans. 
In
connection with acquisitions prior to 2004, the Company assumed certain stock option plans of its acquired companies. The Plans, as assumed, allowed for the granting of incentive and
nonstatutory options to purchase up to 14,595,425 shares of Millennium common stock. At December31, 2007, a total of 390,897 shares of common stock have been reserved for the exercise of
options outstanding under these assumed Plans. No options are available for future grant under these plans. Under
the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, eligible employees may purchase common stock at a price per share equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at
the beginning or end of each offering period. Participation in the offering is limited to 10% of the employee compensation or $25,000 in any calendar year. The offering periods begin on May1
and November1 of each year. At December31, 2007, subscriptions were outstanding for an estimated 74,356 shares at $996 per share.

11.Income Taxes 
The difference between the Company expected tax provision benefit, as computed by applying the U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 35% to income loss before
provision for income taxes, and actual tax is reconciled as follows in thousands: 2007
2006
2005 Income loss before provision for income taxes 14,909 43,953 198,249 Expected income tax benefit at 35% statutory rate 5,218 15,384 69,387 Change in valuation allowance allocated to tax expense 7,172 13,236 68,694 Nondeductible compensation including stock plans 1,089 1,324 Other permanent items 865 824 693 Income tax provision At
December31, 2007, the Company had unused net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $14billion available to reduce federal taxable income,
expiring in 2008 through 2027, and $2660million available to reduce state taxable income, expiring in 2008 through 2012. The Company also has federal and net state tax credits of
approximately $1122million available to offset federal and state income taxes, both of which begin to expire in 2008. Due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of the loss
carryforwards and tax credits, the Company has fully reserved these tax benefits. Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets as of December31 are as follows inthousands: 2007
2006 Net operating loss carryforwards 261,512 276,830 Tax credit carryforwards 77,727 104,291 Capitalized research costs 377,374 388,219 Property and other intangible assets 58,987 65,898 Deferred revenue 5,053 7,769 Stock compensation 18,023 14,216 Accrued restructuring 19,761 27,005 Unrealized loss on marketable securities 143 Other 12,522 13,625 Gross deferred tax assets 830,959 897,996 Valuation allowance 710,037 765,646 Total deferred tax assets 120,922 132,350 Deferred tax liabilities Other intangible assets 118,965 132,350 Unrealized gain on marketable securities 1,957 Total deferred tax liabilities 120,922 132,350 Net deferred taxes 89   Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued 
The valuation allowance decreased by $556million during 2007 due primarily to the Company adoption of FIN48, as more fully described below,
which resulted in a net derecognition of approximately $337million of deferred tax assets from tax credit carryforwards and the related valuation allowance. In addition, there were net
reductions of approximately $149million due to temporary items arising from changes in the differences of costs for financial accounting and tax purposes, especially for capitalized research
costs, property and other intangible assets, accrued restructuring and amortized intangible assets. Net operating loss carryforwards decreased by approximately $153million as the amount of
losses expiring during the year exceeded current net operating losses from operations. 
All
of the Company deferred tax assets that are not offset with reversing deferred tax liabilities have a full valuation allowance recorded against them as, pursuant to the criteria
under SFAS109, it is more likely than not that they will not be realized based on the Company historical accumulated loss position. Should the Company continue to have profitable
operations in the future, some or all of the deferred tax assets may be considered realizable. If and when the Company concludes that the realization of the deferred tax assets is more likely than
not, the Company will record a reduction in the valuation allowance in the period such determination ismade. 
Any
subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December31, 2007 would be allocated as follows inthousands: Reported in the statement of operations 694,052 Reported as a decrease to goodwill 17,942 Reported in other comprehensive income loss 1,957 Total valuation allowance 710,037 As
discussed in Note2, the Company adopted SFAS123R effective January1, 2006 for stock-based compensation plans. Generally, tax return deductions are allowable on
such arrangements, but, may arise in different amounts and periods from compensation costs recognized on financial statements. Pursuant to SFAS123R, if the tax return deduction for an award
exceeds the cumulative compensation cost recognized in the financial statements, any excess tax benefit shall be recognized as additional paid-in capital when the deduction reduces taxes
payable. Prior to adoption, the Company recognized deferred tax assets, along with an offsetting valuation allowance, for net operating loss carryforwards that included deductions for excess tax
benefits from stock-based compensation. On adoption, the Company chose to derecognize the deferred tax asset for these excess tax deductions in the net operating loss carryforwards, along with the
offsetting valuation allowance. The net tax amount of the unrealized excess tax benefits that are no longer included and disclosed as deferred tax assets for December31, 2007, is approximately
$2340million. 
Effective
January1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN48. Upon implementation, the Company derecognized $337million, net, of deferred tax assets related to research
and development and investment tax credit carryforwards that did not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold under FIN48. The adjustment did not
impact retained earnings or the statement of operations, as there is a full valuation allowance recorded against these deferred tax assets. There would be no affect on the Company effective tax rate
upon a recognition of this tax benefit because any increase in the benefit would result an increase in a deferred tax asset and a corresponding increase in the Company valuation allowance. The
Company does not expect that the unrecognized tax benefit will materially increase or decrease in the next year. It is the Company accounting policy to treat interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company 
90 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2007 Continued has
not recognized any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions to date since adoption ofFIN48. A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows inthousands: Balance at January1, 2007 40,013 Additions based on tax positions related to current year 1,040 Other additions or reductions Total valuation allowance 41,053 The
Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to any tax assessment
from an income tax examination in major taxing jurisdictions for years before 2004, except to the extent that in the future it utilizes net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards that originated
before 2004. The Company currently is not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or other jurisdictions for any taxyears. 12.Related Party Transactions 
In November 2003, the Company sold specified assets, including intellectual property to Portola Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Portola, a company founded and
owned in part by a member of Millennium board of directors. In exchange for these assets, the Company received Portola SeriesA preferred convertible stock, representing less than a 5%
ownership in Portola. The investment in Portola is accounted for using the cost method and is included in other assets on the balance sheet at December31, 2007 and 2006. In addition,
commencing in June 2004, Portola sub-leased specified research facilities of the Company in South San Francisco, CA. In August 2004, the Company entered into an additional transaction with
Portola to license to Portola the Company Factor Xa inhibitor program in return for milestone and royalty payments upon achievement of certain events. In December 2007, the Company recorded
$50million in strategic alliance revenue for the achievement of a clinical development milestone under the Factor Xa inhibitor program. In December 2005, the Company entered into a
transaction with Portola to license to Portola the Company Aggregometer system in exchange for cash and Portola SeriesB preferred stock, which combined with the previous stock issued,
maintains the Company ownership in Portola at lessthan5%.

1.Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act as of December31, 2007. In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of December31, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures were 1designed to ensure that material
information relating to us is made known to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer by others, particularly during the period in which this report was prepared, and
2effective, in that they provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. 
2.Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
aManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is
defined in Rule13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company principal executive and
principal financial officers and effected by the Company board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. 
Based
on our assessment, management believes that, as of December31, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
Our
independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below. bAttestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
We
have audited Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria.
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
