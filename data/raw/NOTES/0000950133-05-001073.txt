39 Report of Independent Registered Public Certified Accounting
Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Eclipsys
Corporation We have completed an integrated audit of Eclipsys
Corporations 2004 consolidated financial statements and of
its internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item8, present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Eclipsys Corporation and its subsidiaries
at December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, under Item9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2004 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial 40 statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these
consolidated financial statements. 45 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
1.
Organization and Description of Business Eclipsys is a healthcare information technology company. We
develop and license our proprietary software and content to
hospitals. Our software allows hospitals to automate many of the
key clinical, administrative and financial functions that they
require. Among other things, our software enables physicians and
nurses to check on a patients condition; order patient
tests; review test results; monitor a patients
medications; and provide alerts to changes in a patients
condition. Our software also enables hospitals to admit
patients; maintain patient records; create invoices for billing
patients or insurance companies; control inventories; effect
cost accounting; schedule doctors visits; determine the
profitability of physicians and physician groups; understand the
profitability of specific medical procedures; and perform
numerous other functions.   
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The financial statements include the accounts of Eclipsys and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. Eclipsys manages its
business as one reportable segment. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions
used in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are
based upon managements evaluation of the relevant facts
and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most
significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful
accounts, revenues recognized, the amounts recorded for
capitalized software development costs, the warranty reserve and
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the 2004 presentation. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, we
consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Revenue Recognition Revenues are derived from licensing of computer software;
software and hardware maintenance; professional services
including implementation, integration, training and
consulting; remote hosting; outsourcing; network services; and
the sale of computer hardware. Systems and Services Revenue Multiple Element Arrangements We enter into multiple element arrangements which may provide
for multiple software products subscription contracts
including the rights to future products within the suites
purchased and/or platform protection rights that do not qualify
as exchange rights. Additionally, we enter into traditional
multiple 46 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued element arrangements and also market stand-alone products and
services. Revenue under each of these arrangements is recognized
as follows   
Subscription Contracts Our subscription contracts typically include the following
deliverables   
Software license     
Maintenance     
Professional services;and     
Third party hardware or remote hosting services Software license fees are recognized ratably over the term of
the contract, commencing upon the delivery of the software
provided that 1there is evidence of an arrangement,
2the fee is fixed or determinable and
3collection of our fee is considered probable. The value
of the software is determined using the residual method pursuant
to SOP98-9, Modification of SOP97-2, With
Respect to Certain Transactions or SOP98-9. These
contracts contain the rights to unspecified future products
within the product suite purchased or unspecified platform
transfer rights that do not qualify for exchange accounting.
Accordingly, these arrangements are accounted for pursuant to
paragraphs48 and 49 of SOP97-2 Software
Revenue Recognition or SOP97-2. Under certain
arrangements, we capitalize related direct costs consisting of
third party software costs and direct software implementation
costs. These costs are amortized over the term of the
arrangement. In the case of maintenance revenues, vendor-specific objective
evidence or VSOE of fair value is based on substantive renewal
prices, and the revenues are recognized ratably over the
maintenance. In the case of professional services revenues, VSOE is based on
prices from stand-alone sale transactions, and the revenues are
recognized as services are performed pursuant to
paragraph65 of SOP97-2. Third party hardware revenues are recognized upon delivery,
pursuant to SAB104. Remote hosting services, where VSOE is based upon consistent
pricing charged to customers based on volumes and performance
requirements on a stand-alone basis and substantive renewal
terms, and the revenues are recognized ratably over the contract
term as the services are performed. Our remote hosting
arrangements generally require us to perform one-time set-up
activities and include a one-time set-up fee. This one-time
set-up fee is generally paid by the customer at contract
execution. We have determined that these set-up activities do
not constitute a separate unit of accounting, and accordingly
the related set-up fees are recognized ratably over the term of
the contract. We consider the applicability of EITF00-3,
Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to
Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored On
Another Entitys Hardware, to our remote hosting
services arrangements on a contract-by-contract basis. If we
determine that the customer has the contractual right to take
possession of our software at any time during the hosting period
without significant penalty, and can feasibly run the software
on its own hardware or enter into another arrangement with a
third party to host the software, a software element covered by
SOP97-2 exists. When a software element exists in a remote
hosting services arrangement, we recognize the license,
professional services and remote hosting services revenues
pursuant to SOP97-2, whereby the fair value of the remote
hosting service is recognized as revenue ratably over the term
of the remote hosting contract. If we determine that a software
element covered by SOP97-2 is not present in a remote
hosting services arrangement; we recognize revenue for the
remote hosting services arrangement, ratably over the term of
the remote hosting contract pursuant to SAB104. 47 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Traditional Software Contracts We enter into traditional multiple element arrangements that
include the following elements   
Software license     
Maintenance     
Professional services;and     
Third party hardware or remote hosting services Revenue for each of the elements is recognized as follows Software license fees are recognized upon delivery of the
software provided that 1there is evidence of an
arrangement, 2the fee is fixed or determinable and
3collection of our fee is considered probable. For those
arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or
determinable, the software license revenue is recognized as the
payments become due. For arrangements where VSOE only exists for
the undelivered elements, we account for the delivered elements
software license revenue using the residual method in
accordance with SOP98-9. In addition to the software license fees, these contracts may
also contain maintenance, professional services and hardware or
remote hosting services. VSOE and revenue recognition for these
elements is determined using the same methodology as noted above
for subscription contracts.   
Software Contracts Requiring Contract Accounting We enter into certain multiple element arrangements in which the
professional services are considered essential to the
functionality of the software. Under these arrangements,
software license fees and professional service revenues are
recognized using the percentage-of-completion method over the
implementation period which generally ranges from 12 to
24months. Under the percentage-of-completion method,
revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the
implementation based upon estimates of total labor hours
incurred and revenues to be generated over the term of the
implementation. Changes in estimates of total labor hours and
the related effect on the timing of revenues and profits are
recognized in the period in which they are determinable.
Accordingly, changes in these estimates could occur and have a
material effect on our operating results in the period of change.   
Stand-Alone Products and Services We also market products and services on a stand-alone basis.
These products and services include   
Software license     
Maintenance     
Professional services     
Hardware     
Network services     
Remote hosting services     
Outsourcing Revenue related to these products and services are recognized as
follows Software license fees and maintenance are marketed on a
stand-alone basis may be licensed either under traditional
contracts or under subscription arrangements. Software license
fees under traditional contracts are 48 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued recognized pursuant to SOP97-2 upon delivery of the
software, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee
is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. Under
subscription agreements for stand-alone products, software
license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the
contract. With respect to maintenance, VSOE is determined based
on substantive renewal prices contained in the contracts.
Maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Professional services represent incremental services marketed to
customers including implementation and consulting services.
Professional services revenues, where VSOE is based on prices
from stand-alone transactions are recognized as services are
performed. Hardware is recognized upon delivery pursuant to SAB104. Network service arrangements include the assessment, assembly
and delivery of a wireless network which may include wireless
carts or other wireless equipment to the customer. Our network
services arrangements are sold to a customer for a fixed fee.
All services are performed prior to the delivery of the
equipment. These contracts are typically 60 to 90days in
length and are recognized pursuant to SAB104, upon the
delivery of the network to the customer. Remote hosting contracts that are sold on a stand alone basis
are recognized ratably over the contract term pursuant to
SAB104. Our remote hosting arrangements generally require
us to perform one-time set-up activities and include a one-time
set-up fee. This one-time set-up fee is generally paid by the
customer at contract execution. We have determined that these
set-up activities do not constitute a separate unit of
accounting, and accordingly we recognize the related set-up fees
ratably over the term of the contract. We provide outsourcing services to our customers. Under these
arrangements we assume all responsibilities for a healthcare
organizations IT operations using our employees. Our
outsourcing services include facilities management, network
outsourcing and transition management. These arrangements
typically range from five to ten years in duration. Revenues
from these arrangements are recognized when services are
performed. Warranty Reserve The license agreements for our software products include a
limited warranty. The warranty provides that the product, in its
unaltered form, will perform substantially in accordance with
the related documentation. Through September30, 2003, we
had not incurred any material warranty costs related to its
products. As a result of the response time issues identified
during the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded warranty
provisions of $46million through December31, 2004.
Warranty costs are charged to costs of systems and services
revenues when they are probable and reasonably estimable. A
summary of the activity in our warranty reserve was as follows

Unbilled Accounts Receivable and Deferred Revenue The timing of revenue recognition and contractual billing terms
under certain multiple element arrangements may not precisely
coincide, resulting in the recording of unbilled accounts
receivable or deferred revenue. Customer payments are due under
these arrangements in varying amounts upon the achievement of 49 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued certain contractual milestones throughout the implementation
periods, which generally range from 12 to 24months. The
current portion of unbilled accounts receivable is included in
accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain certain long-term contracts used to
finance a portion of certain customer hardware and software fees
owed. These arrangements generally provide for payment terms
that range from 3 to 5years and carry interest rates that
range from 7% to 10%. Such amounts are recorded as non-current
unbilled accounts receivable. The non-current portion of amounts
due related to these arrangements was $11million and
$10million as of December31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and is included in other assets in the
accompanying financial statements. The current portion of

Inventory Inventory consists of computer equipment, parts and peripherals
and is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out method. Capitalized Software Development Costs We capitalize a portion of our computer software development
costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological
feasibility. These costs include salaries, benefits, consulting
and other directly related costs incurred in connection with
programming and testing software products. Capitalization ceases
when the products are generally released for sale to customers.
Management monitors the net realizable value of development
costs to ensure that the investment will be recovered through
future revenues. Capitalized software development costs were
approximately $152million, $182million and
$88million for the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. These costs are amortized over the
greater of the ratio that current revenues are to total and
anticipated future revenues for the applicable product or the
straight-line method over three years. Amortization of
capitalized software development costs, which is included in
costs of systems and services revenues, was approximately
$106million, $82million and $63million for
the years ended December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized software
development costs was $176million and $286million
as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, we
wrote-off fully amortized capitalized software development costs
in the amount of $216million. Write-down of Capitalized Software Development Costs On October20, 2003, we announced that we had identified a
response time issue with some components of SunriseXA, the
newest version of Eclipsys Sunrise suite of software. To
address the issue, we developed a strategy designed to allow
SunriseXA customers to continue their deployment of SunriseXA,
and to enable us to continue our development of planned advanced
SunriseXA components. The strategy was to replace the affected
SunriseXA components with certain components of the SCM product.
In connection with the strategy, we recorded a $12million
write-down of capitalized software development costs for certain
SunriseXA components to net realizable value. The write-down is
included in the cost of systems and services revenues. 50 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Acquired Technology and Intangible Assets Acquired technology and intangible assets are amortized over
their estimated useful lives generally on a straight-line basis.
The carrying values of acquired technology and intangible assets
are reviewed if the facts and circumstances suggest that they
may be impaired and goodwill is reviewed at least annually. This
review indicates whether assets will be recoverable based on
future expected cash flows. We perform our review for impairment
of our intangible assets including goodwill during the fourth
quarter of each fiscal year. Such a review was performed in the
fourth quarter of 2004 and no impairment related issues were
noted. The gross and net amounts for acquired technology, goodwill, and
intangible assets consisted of the following as of

cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and other
current liabilities, approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. Income Taxes We account for income taxes utilizing the liability method, and
deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated
future tax effects of differences between the financial
reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and tax
carry-forwards given the provisions of the enacted tax laws. 51 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic
value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion,
APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and related Interpretations. Under this
method, compensation costs for stock options is measured as the
excess, if any, of the estimated market price of our stock at
the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to
acquire the stock. Accordingly, we provide the additional
disclosures required under SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation as amended
by SFASNo148 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure. We
have issued restricted common stock to key employees at nominal
prices. We record unearned stock compensation for such items and
recognize stock compensation expense ratably over the vesting
period of the restricted common stock agreements. We have adopted the disclosure only provision of SFAS123.
If compensation costs for our stock option grants described
above were determined based on the fair value at the grant date
for awards in 2004, 2003 and 2002, consistent with the
provisions of SFAS123, Eclipsys net loss and loss
per share would have been increased to the pro forma amounts

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2004,
2003, and 2002: dividend yield of 0% for all years, risk-free
interest rate of 330% for 2004, 263% for 2003, and 311% for
2002, expected life of 492years for 2004, 488years
for 2003, and 484years for 2002, based on the plan and
volatility of 87% for 2004, 92% for 2003, and 92% for 2002. Basic and Diluted Net Loss Income Per Share For all periods presented, basic and diluted net loss income
per common share is presented in accordance with SFAS128,
Earnings per Share, which provides for the
accounting principles used in the calculation of earnings per
share. Basic net loss income per common share is based on the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the
potential dilution from assumed conversion of all dilutive
securities such as stock option warrants and unvested restricted
stock. Stock options to acquire 9,138,452, 9,268,674 and
9,020,711shares of common stock at December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively; warrants to acquire up to
5,160shares of common stock at December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002; and unvested restricted stock of 371,250, 136,250
and 150,000 at 52 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were the
only securities issued which would be included in the diluted
earnings per share calculation, if dilutive. In all years
presented, the inclusion of stock options, warrants and unvested
restricted stock would have been anti-dilutive due to the net
loss reported by us, and therefore excluded from the
calculation. The computations of the basic and diluted per share
amounts were as follows for the years ended December31 in

Concentration of Credit Risk Our customers operate primarily in the healthcare industry. We
sell our products and services under contracts with varying
terms. The accounts receivable amounts are unsecured. We believe
that the allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover
credit losses. We do not believe that the loss of any one
customer would have a material effect on our financial position. Foreign Currency Our financial position and results of operations of foreign
subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the respective
countries as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are
translated at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the balance
sheet date, while revenue and expenses for the year are
translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the
year. Translation gains and losses are not included in
determining net income or loss but are accumulated and reported
as a separate component of stockholders equity. We have
not entered into any hedging contracts during the three-year
period ended December31, 2004. Comprehensive Income Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income
requires that the total changes in equity resulting from
revenue, expenses, and gains and losses, including those that do
not affect the accumulated deficit, be reported. Accordingly,
those amounts, which are comprised solely of foreign currency
translation adjustments, are included in other comprehensive
income in the consolidated statement of changes in
stockholders equity. New Accounting Pronouncements On December16, 2004, the FASB issued
SFASNo123R, Share-Based Payment,
SFAS123R which is a revision of
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS123.
Statement123R supersedes APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends 53 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued SFASNo95, Statement of Cash Flows.
Generally, the approach in SFAS123R is similar to the
approach described in SFAS123. SFAS123R requires all
share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the income
statement based on their grant date fair values over the
corresponding service period and also requires an estimation of
forfeitures when calculating compensation expense. The Company
must adopt SFAS123R no later than July1, 2005.
SFAS123R permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of three methods: the modified
prospective method, the modified retrospective
method to January1, 2005, or the modified
retrospective method to all prior years for which
SFAS123 was effective. The Company has not yet determined
which adoption method it will utilize. The Company has not yet
decided whether it will adopt the provisions of this standard on
July1, 2005 as required, or earlier, as allowed.

Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and
amortization are provided for using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives, which generally range from 2 to
7years. Computer equipment is depreciated over 2 to
5years. Office equipment is depreciated over two to seven
years. Purchased software for internal use is amortized over
3years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the remaining term
of the lease. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of,
the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in
income. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance not considered
to substantially lengthen the property and equipment lives are
charged to expense as incurred. The balances for property and
equipment were as follows as of December31, in thousands

Stockholders Equity Restricted Stock Grant On July15, 2002, Mr.Paul L. Ruflin joined us as our
Chief Executive Officer and President. Under his employment
arrangement with Eclipsys, Mr.Ruflin received a restricted
stock grant effective July15, 2002 of 150,000shares
of Eclipsys common stock, subject to a five-year vesting
schedule, plus an option to purchase850,000shares of
Eclipsys common stock at a price of $750, with vesting
over a five-year period. During the third and fourth quarters of 2004, we issued
295,000shares of restricted common stock at a nominal
price, subject to five-year vesting. Stock compensation related to all restricted stock issued
amounted to $428,000 in 2004, $225,000 in 2003 and $103,000 in
2002. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
Eclipsys had unearned stock compensation of $56million
and $795,000 recorded as a component of stockholders
equity. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2004, the
Company accelerated vesting of certain stock options and
recorded stock 54 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued based compensation expense of $49,000. For the year ended
December31, 2004, total stock compensation expense was
$477,000. Undesignated Preferred Stock We have available for issuance, 5,000,000shares of
preferred stock. As discussed below under Shareholder
Rights Plan, the Board has designated 100,000 of the
5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock as SeriesA
Junior Participating Preferred Stock. Eclipsys has a balance of
4,900,000 authorized shares of undesignated preferred stock the
Undesignated Preferred. The liquidation, voting,
conversion and other related provisions of the Undesignated
Preferred will be determined by the Board of Directors at the
time of issuance. Currently, there are no outstanding preferred
shares. Shareholder Rights Plan On July26, 2000, our Board of Directors declared a
dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of
Eclipsys Common Stock to stockholders of record at the
close of business on August9, 2000. Each Right entitles
the registered holder to purchase from Eclipsys one
one-thousandth of a share of SeriesA Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, $01par value per share, at a Purchase
Price of $6500 in cash, subject to adjustment. The Rights will
initially trade together with Eclipsys Common Stock, and
will not be exercisable. If a person or group other than an
exempt person acquires 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
Eclipsys Common Stock, the Rights generally will become
exercisable and allow the holder other than the 15% purchaser
to purchase shares of Eclipsys Common Stock at a 50%
discount to the market price. The effect will be to discourage
acquisitions of 15% or more of Eclipsys Common Stock
without negotiations with the Board of Directors. The terms of
the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of
July26, 2000 the Rights Agreement between
Eclipsys and Fleet National Bank, as Rights Agent. The Board has
designated 100,000 of the 5,000,000 authorized shares of
preferred stock as SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred
Stock. Secondary Offering of Common Stock On January23, 2001, we completed a follow-on public
offering for 5,750,000shares of our common stock. Net
proceeds from the offering were approximately
$1232million.

At December31, 2004, we had net operating loss
carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately
$2868million. The carryforwards expire in varying amounts
through 2024. Of this amount, $482million relate to stock
option tax deductions, which will be tax-effected and the
benefit credited as additional paid-in-capital when realized.
Additionally, we have Canadian net operating loss carryovers of
approximately $112million that expire in varying amounts
through 2011. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of, and the
benefits from, net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired
or limited in certain circumstances. We experienced an ownership
change as defined under Section382 of the Internal Revenue
Code in November 1998. As a result of the ownership change, net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $169million
at November 1998, which were incurred prior to the date of the
change, are subject to annual limitations on their future use.
As of December31, 2004, net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $63million remain subject to the annual
limitation. As of December31, 2004, a valuation allowance
has been established against the deferred tax assets that
management does not believe are more likely than not to be
realized. 56 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Stock Plan allowed for the issuance of options or other awards
to purchase up to 2,500,000shares of Common Stock.
Pursuant to the terms of the 1996 Stock Plan, a committee of the
Board was authorized to grant awards to employees and
non-employees, and to establish vesting terms. The options
expire ten years from the date of grant. No additional options
or other awards may be granted under the 1996 Stock Plan. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan In January 1998, the Board adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan

Employee Savings Plan During 1997, we established a Savings Plan the
Plan pursuant to Section401k of the
Internal Revenue Code the Code, whereby employees
may contribute a percentage of their compensation, not to exceed the maximum amount allowable under the Code. At the
discretion of our Board of Directors, we may elect to make
matching contributions, as defined in the Plan. For the years
ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Board
authorized contributions totaling $750,000 for each year. 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under our 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase
Plan that was implemented in April 1998, our employees,
including directors who are employees, are eligible to
participate in quarterly plan offerings in which payroll
deductions may be used to purchase shares of Common Stock. The
purchase price of such shares is the lower of 85% of the fair
market value of the Common Stock on the day the offering
commences and 85% of the fair market value of the Common Stock
on the day the offering terminates. During the second quarter of
2004, we suspended the Purchase Plan indefinitely. 58 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Commitments and Contingencies Noncancelable Operating Leases We lease office space and certain equipment under noncancelable
operating leases. Rental expense under operating leases was
approximately $97million, $125million and
$118million for the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Future minimum rental payments
under non-cancelable operating leases as of December31,
2004 are as follows in thousands

We have unconditional purchase obligations that consist of
minimum purchase commitments for telecommunication services,
computer equipment, maintenance, consulting, airplane charters
and other commitments. In aggregate, these obligations total
approximately $300million. These obligations will require
payments of approximately $204million in 2005, with the
majority of the balance occurring within the next three years. Indemnification clauses Our standard software license agreements contain indemnification
clauses that are limited in amount. Pursuant to these clauses,
we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the
indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
indemnified party. We believe the estimated fair value of these
indemnification clauses is minimal. Accordingly, there are no
liabilities recorded for these agreements as of
December31, 2004.   
8.
Acquisitions In March 2004, we acquired CPM Resource Center, Ltd., or CPMRC.
CPMRC provides consulting services and clinical content designed
principally to improve and enhance the care process primarily
related to the workflow of nurses and interdisciplinary
healthcare professionals. CPMRCs evidence-based content
and practice guidelines has been incorporated into our current
releases of SunriseXA software. We paid $25million in
cash and issued 184,202shares of common stock for CPMRC,
for a total consideration of $50million. The prior owner
of CPMRC may earn up to an additional $125million over
the next 5year period based on future operating results,
payable in shares of our common stock, based upon the average of
the last reported sale prices of our common stock on the NASDAQ
National Market for the five consecutive trading days ending on
the trading day that is one day prior to the date on which the
earn-out consideration is paid. The operating results of CPMRC
have been combined with those of the Eclipsys since the date of
acquisition. We did not present unaudited pro forma results of
operations of Eclipsys and CPMRC for the year ended
December31, 2004 and 2003 because our pro forma results
for those periods would not be materially different from our
actual results for those periods. As a result of the CPMRC acquisition, we recorded approximately
$24million in non amortizable goodwill and
$32million in amortizable intangible assets. Amortizable
intangible assets include customer relationships and
intellectual property and is being amortized over a seven and
five year period, respectively 59 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued which we believe approximates the expected utility of these
assets. The non amortizable goodwill is not tax deductible. The
non amortizable goodwill reflects approximately $700,000 of
incremental consideration that the prior owners earned in 2004
as part of the earn out provisions of the agreement. All
consideration paid under the earn out provisions of the
agreement will be recorded as non amortizable goodwill. In December of 2004, we acquired eSys Medical Inc. eSys. eSys
develops and markets radiology information systems RIS. We
believe eSys RIS will enhance our diagnostic imaging
solution and extend our clinical workflow solutions in
radiology. Using our solutions, clinicians will be able to view
patient medical records, diagnostic images and reports in real
time. We believe the acquisition will increase sales
opportunities for our Picture Archiving Communications System
PACSand RIS systems through integration with both our
and other clinical systems. In 2004, we paid $23million
in cash consideration for the eSys acquisition. Under the terms
of the transaction, the prior owners of eSys may earn up to an
additional $25million of future consideration. This
consideration may be earned during the next eighteen months
related to certain milestones in connection with future
development efforts of the acquired technology. This future
consideration, if earned, will be paid in cash 25% and our
common stock 75%. Additionally, the agreement contains an earn
out provision in which the prior owners can earn up to an
additional $50million in future consideration based on
sales of the acquired technology over the next five years,
payable in shares of our common stock. Any shares of our common
stock issued as earn-out consideration will be based on the
average closing prices of our common stock on the NASDAQ
National Market for the calendar quarter preceding the payment
of the earn-out consideration. As a result of the eSys acquisition, we recorded approximately
$20million in amortizable intangible assets. Amortizable
intangible assets include customer relationships
$11million and acquired technology $914,000 and is
being amortized over a five and three year period, respectively.
We believe these amortization periods reflect the estimated
expected utility of these assets. The operating results of eSys
have been combined with those of Eclipsys since the date of
acquisition. We did not present unaudited pro forma results of
operations of Eclipsys and eSys for the year ended
December31, 2004 and 2003 because our pro forma results
for those periods would not be materially different from our
actual results for those periods. The majority of future
consideration, if earned, will be recorded as non amortizable
goodwill. With respect to the acquisitions of CPMRC and eSys, we assigned
the total purchase price to the net assets and liabilities of
the businesses with any remaining amount assigned to goodwill.
The value assigned to the identifiable intangible assets was
based on an analysis as of the date of acquisitions.

Litigation We are involved in litigation incidental to our business from
time to time. In the opinion of management, after consultation
with legal counsel, the ultimate outcome of such litigation will
not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operation or cash flows.   
10.
Related Party Transactions We have certain transactions between us and our executive
officers, directors and affiliates. We lease office space in Boston, Massachusetts from a former
stockholder of SDK Medical Computer Services Corporation, or
SDK, and lease office space in Grand Rapids, Michigan from the
former stockholder of CPMRC, both are current employees. SDK was
acquired in 1997. During the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, we paid $675,000, $526,000 and $579,000
respectively, under the Boston lease and $42,000 in 2004 for the
Michigan lease. The leases are non-cancelable and expire in 2009
and 2008 respectively. Our Chairman Emeritus, Harvey J. Wilson, owns a company, RMSC of
West Palm Beach Inc. RMSC, which leases an
aircraft to a charter company. The charter company provides
aircraft charter 60 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued services to us as well as other outside parties. Mr.Wilson
has no ownership or other interest in the charter company. We
paid the charter company $733,000, $603,000 and $885,000 in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for charters using the
aircraft owned by RMSC. We also paid the charter company
$74,000, $50,000 and $265,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, for charters of other aircraft, not owned by RMSC.
RMSC received $408,000, $275,000, and $533,000 during 2004, 2003
and 2002 respectively, from the charter company for these
transactions. During January 2004, we contracted for a minimum
number of hours for airplane charters to extend the current
pricing terms. The remaining minimum commitment under this
arrangement is $944,000. RMSC agreed to allow the unused portion
to be utilized in 2005 which is reflected in the above
commitment. The arrangement ends in January 2006. In July 1999, we invested in HEALTHvision, Inc.
HEALTHvision, a Dallas-based, privately held
internet healthcare company. Other principal investors included
VHA, Inc. and investment entities affiliated with General
Atlantic Partners, LLC. HEALTHvision provides Internet solutions
to hospital organizations to assist them in improving patient
care in the local communities they serve. We purchased
3,400,000shares of common stock in HEALTHvision for
$34,000, which at the time represented 34% of the outstanding
common stock on an if-converted basis. As of December31,
2004, our shares represented approximately 28% of the common
stock of HEALTHvision on an if-converted basis. We account for
our investment in HEALTHvision using the equity method of
accounting. Due to losses recognized under the equity method,
the recorded balance of the investment in HEALTHvision was $0 as
of December31, 2004. We entered into a joint marketing
arrangement with HEALTHvision under which both organizations
agreed to jointly market products and services to their
customers. Under this agreement, we paid HEALTHvision the sum of
$21million during 2004 for the sale of products and
services, and owed HEALTHvision the sum of $08million as
of December31, 2004. Also, during 2004, we earned revenues
from HEALTHvision of $11million for hosting and other
related services and had accounts receivable due from
HEALTHvision of $03million at December31, 2004. For
the year ended December31, 2004, HEALTHvision, Inc. had
total revenues of approximately $237million
unauditedand a net loss of approximately
$28million unauditedwith total assets of
approximately $103million unaudited. We are not
required to provide funding to HEALTHvision, and have made no
guarantees on their behalf. In late 2003, we mutually agreed
with HEALTHvision to terminate the joint marketing arrangement
of our agreement. We have a license agreement with Partners HealthCare System,
Inc. Partners. Under the terms of this license, we
may develop, commercialize, distribute and support certain
technology that it has received from Partners throughout the
world with the exception of the Boston, Massachusetts
metropolitan area. Prior to our initial public offering, no
sales of products incorporating the licensed technology were
made and, consequently, no royalties were paid by us pursuant to
the license with Partners. The royalty arrangement under the
license terminated upon Eclipsys initial public offering.
After our initial public offering, we sold products
incorporating the licensed technology. We are obligated to offer
to Partners and certain of its affiliates a license for internal
use, granted on most favored customer terms, to all new software
applications developed by us, whether or not derived from the
licensed technology, and major architectural changes to the
licensed technology. Partners and certain of its affiliates are
also entitled to receive internal use licenses, also granted on
most favored customer terms, for any changes to any module or
application included in the licensed technology requiring at
least one person-year of technical effort. In 2001, Partners entered into a contract with us for the
license of a new software application and related professional
services. This new software application consisted of an upgrade
to an existing software application that Partners had licensed
from Transition Systems, Inc, an entity that was acquired by us
in December 1998. Under this new contract, Partners paid us the
sums of $691,000, $627,000 and $1,032,000 in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. As of December31, 2004, Partners owed
us the sum of $403,000 related to this contract. Mr.Jay
Pieper, a director of Eclipsys, is Vice President of Corporate
Development and Treasury Affairs for Partners. Partners was not
affiliated with Eclipsys at the time of the negotiation of the
Partners license from Transition Systems, Inc. 61 ECLIPSYS CORPORATION SCHEDULEII VALUATION OF QUALIFYING

Controls and Procedures Evaluation
of Disclosure and Controls and Procedures in Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting Our management, with the participation of our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December31, 2004. The term disclosure controls and
procedures defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under
the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
company that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by Eclipsys in the reports that it files or submits
under the Executive Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the companys management,
including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management recognizes that our disclosure
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and management necessarily applies it judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2004,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. No changes in our internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange
Act occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December31,
2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   
Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004. In making this
assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based
on our assessment using those criteria, we concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December31, 2004. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
herein. PartIII Certain information required by PartIII of Form10-K
will be contained in the definitive Proxy Statement to be used
in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders for the
year 2005, and is incorporated herein by reference to this
Form10-K Annual Report
