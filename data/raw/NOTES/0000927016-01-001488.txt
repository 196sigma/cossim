24             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors
American Dental Partners, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American
Dental Partners, Inc. the ''Company'' as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American
Dental Partners, Inc. as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Years Ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000
1 Description of Business
American Dental Partners, Inc. the ''Company'' was formed in December
1995 to provide business services to dental groups and commenced operations in
January 1996. The Company acquires substantially all the assets of the dental
practices with which it affiliates, except those required by law to be owned or
maintained by dentists such as third party contracts, certain governmental
receivables and patient records, and enters into long-term service agreements
with these affiliated dental groups. The Company provides all services necessary
for the administration of the non-clinical aspects of the dental operations.
Services provided to the affiliated dental groups include sharing the best
practices of its affiliates and providing assistance with organizational
planning and development; recruiting, retention and training programs; quality
assurance initiatives; facilities development and management; employee benefits
administration; procurement; information systems; marketing and payor relations;
and financial planning, reporting and analysis. The Company operates in one
segment.
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on
the accrual basis of accounting. The Company does not own any interests in or
control the activities of the affiliated dental groups. Accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements of the affiliated dental groups are not
consolidated with those of the Company.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999 in order to conform
with the December 31, 2000 presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company believes the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, receivables due from affiliated dental groups, accounts
payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term
nature of these items. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair
value because the interest rates approximate rates at which similar types of
borrowing arrangements could be obtained by the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
For the Years Ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000
Net Revenue
The Company net revenue represents primarily reimbursement of expenses
and fees charged to affiliated dental groups pursuant to the terms of the
service agreements. Under such agreements, the affiliated dental groups
reimburse the Company for expenses incurred on their behalf in connection with
the operation and administration of the dental facilities and pay fees to the
Company for its business services. The Company service fee consists of either
i a variable monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage, ii a
fixed monthly fee and an additional variable fee or iii a fixed monthly fee.
Additionally, the Company net revenue includes amounts from dental benefit
providers related to the arrangement of the provision of care to patients. The
Company records all revenue as services are provided.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of dental supplies and are stated at the
lower of cost or market.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the related assets which are 30-40 years for buildings, 3-12 years for equipment
and 5-7 years for furniture and fixtures.
Property and equipment under capital leases are stated at the present value
of minimum lease payments at inception of the lease. Equipment held under
capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization of assets subject
to capital leases is included in depreciation expense.
Intangible Assets
Identifiable intangible assets result from service agreements with the
affiliated dental groups and goodwill associated with the Company acquisition.
The estimated fair value of the service agreements is the excess of the purchase
price over the estimated fair value of the tangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed of dental practices. Intangible assets associated with
service agreements and goodwill are amortized on a straight-line basis over 15
to 25 years. In the event a service agreement is terminated, the related
affiliated dental group is generally required to purchase, at the Company
option, the unamortized balance of intangible assets at the current book value,
as well as all related other assets associated with the affiliated dental group.
Accumulated amortization amounted to $2,405,000, $4,984,000 and $8,369,000 at
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.
The Company reviews the carrying value of intangible assets on an entity by
entity basis to determine if facts and circumstances exist which would suggest
that the intangible assets may be impaired or that the amortization period needs
to be modified. Among the factors the Company considers in making the evaluation
are changes in the groups' market position, reputation, profitability and
geographical penetration. If conditions are present which indicate impairment is
probable, the Company prepares a projection of the undiscounted cash flows of
the specific practice and determine if the intangible assets are recoverable
based on these undiscounted cash flows. If impairment is indicated, then an
adjustment is made to reduce the carrying amount of the intangible assets to
their fair value based on discounted cash flows.

For the Years Ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary
differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
basis of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes of
changes in the tax rate is recognized in operations in the period that includes
the enactment date.
Stock Option Plans
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, allows companies to recognize expense
for the fair value of stock-based awards or to continue to apply the provisions
of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and disclose
the effects of SFAS 123 as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS 123
had been applied. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense is recognized
only if on the measurement date the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds
the exercise price. The Company has elected to apply the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS 123.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share are computed based on Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128 SFAS 128, Earnings per Share. SFAS 128 requires
presentation of basic earnings per share Basic EPS and diluted earnings per
share Diluted EPS by all entities that have publicly traded common stock or
potential common stock options, warrants, convertible securities or contingent
stock arrangements. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period. The computation of Diluted EPS does not
assume conversion, exercise or contingent exercise of securities that would have
an antidilutive effect on earnings.

3 Accounts Receivable and Net Revenue
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable represent amounts due from dental benefit providers
related to the arrangement of the provision of care to patients.
Receivables Due From Affiliated Dental Groups
Receivables due from affiliated dental groups represent amounts due
pursuant to the terms of the service agreements as described below.
Adjusted Gross Revenue--Affiliated Dental Groups
The affiliated dental groups record revenue at established rates reduced by
contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at
adjusted gross revenue. Contractual adjustments represent the difference between
gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges
reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts.
The Company does not consolidate the financial statements of its affiliated
dental groups with those of the Company. The adjusted gross revenue and amounts
retained by the affiliated dental groups are presented below for illustrative
purposes only in thousands                                         Years Ended December 31,

Net Revenue
The Company net revenue represents primarily reimbursement of expenses
and fees charged to affiliated dental groups pursuant to the terms of the
service agreements. Under such agreements, the affiliated dental groups
reimburse the Company for actual expenses incurred on their behalf in connection
with the operation and administration of the dental facilities and pay fees to
the Company for its business services. Under certain service agreements, the
Company service fee consists of a variable monthly fee which is based upon a
specified percentage of the amount by which the PC adjusted gross revenue
exceeds expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration of
the dental facilities. Under certain service agreements, the Company service
fees consist of a fixed monthly fee and an additional variable fee. To the
extent that there is operating income after payment of the fixed monthly fee,
reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with the operation and
administration of the dental facilities and payment of provider expenses, an
additional variable fee is paid to the Company in the amount of such excess up
to budgeted operating income and 50% of such excess over budgeted operating
income. Under certain service agreements, the Company service fee consists
entirely of a fixed monthly fee. The fixed monthly fees are determined by
agreement of the Company and the affiliated dental groups in a formal budgeting
process. Additionally, the Company net revenue includes amounts from dental
benefit providers related to the arrangement of the provision of care to
patients.

In 1996, a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $3,062,000 was
established because, based on the limited operating history of the Company and
other available evidence at the time, it was considered more likely than not
that the deferred tax assets would not be realized. In 1997, the valuation
allowance was reduced by $608,000 to $2,454,000. In 1998, the valuation
allowance was reversed due to the Company taxable earnings and management
assessment that it was more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax
assets would be realized through future taxable earnings. The reversal of the
valuation allowance attributable to acquired deferred tax assets reduced
intangible assets by $2,083,000. The remaining reversal of the valuation
allowance provided a tax benefit of $371,000 in the Company consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1998.

Accounting for Stock Compensation Plans
The Company accounts for stock compensation plans in accordance with APB
No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized in the
financial statements for stock compensation plans. Pro forma information
regarding net earnings and earnings per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and
has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock compensation
plans under the fair value method. The fair value for these options and purchase
rights granted was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years
ended December 31                                  1998            1999           2000

granted during the   $302    $482     $345   $348     $381   $224   The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company stock options and purchase rights have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes
in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options and
purchase rights.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options and purchase rights is amortized to expense over the options' vesting
period and the purchase rights' option period. The Company pro forma net
earnings and earnings per share are as follows in thousands, except per share

In January 2001, three of the Company affiliated dental groups, Park
Dental, Associated Dental Care Providers and University Dental Associates,
received notices of contract termination from Cigna Dental and Associated Dental
Care Providers received notice of contract termination from Protective Life
Corporation. The four contracts represented approximately $241 million of
affiliate adjusted gross revenue in 2000. The effective dates of termination for
these four contracts are i July 31, 2001 for Park Dental, ii March 31, 2001
for University Dental Associates and iii March 31, 2001 Cigna Dental and
April 8, 2001 Protective Life for Associated Dental Care Providers. These
affiliates subsequently received proposed terms for new provider contracts from
Cigna Dental. The affiliates found the proposed terms unacceptable, and the
Company is working with them in evaluating their options in light of the
termination notices. In evaluating options, the Company and its affiliates
believe that the financial impact of not continuing as a provider with both
dental benefit plan providers, while difficult to ascertain precisely, would be
less severe than accepting the proposed provider relationships. While the exact
outcome cannot be determined at this time, the Company believes the disruption
being caused by the termination notices may impact net earnings for the first
and second quarters of 2001.
