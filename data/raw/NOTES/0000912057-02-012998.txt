Board of Directors
EXE Technologies,Inc. 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EXE Technologies,Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2000 and 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of EXE Technologies,Inc. and
subsidiaries at December31, 2000 and 2001, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Dallas,

EXE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
EXE Technologies,Inc. the Company or EXE provides software that drives customers' supply chain execution processes, including fulfillment, warehousing,
distribution, and inventory management. The Company operates from its headquarters located in Dallas, Texas, and through its various subsidiary and sales offices serving North America, Europe, the
Middle East, Asia, and Australia. 
The
consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company revenues consist of software license revenues, consulting service revenues, maintenance revenues, and revenues from the resale of software and
equipment. Software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition. Under SOP 97-2, software license revenues are recognized upon execution of a contract and delivery of software, provided that the license fee is fixed and determinable; no
significant production, modification, or customization of the software is required;
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allow the allocation of the total fee to elements of the arrangement; and collection is considered probable by management. 
Revenue
from services is recognized as the services are provided. The Company standard service arrangement limits the customer remedy and the Company liability to the underlying
service fees specified in the separate service arrangement. If disputes arise with a customer, a provision is recorded based on the specific customer situation and the Company assessment of the
potential outcome of that situation. Maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the obligation. Revenues from resale of software and equipment are
recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and shipment of the software and equipment to the customer provided the following criteria are met: payment terms are fixed and determinable; no significant
production, modification, or customization is required; and collection is considered probable by management. 
The
Company standard license arrangements specify that the customer accepts the software under the arrangement when the software is shipped and that the license fees under the
arrangement are not refundable. The Company periodically enters into arrangements which do not have standard acceptance and warranty provisions. Such contracts are analyzed and timing of revenue
recognition is determined based upon specific facts and circumstances. If warranty and acceptance criteria differs from the Company standard criteria, revenue recognition is deferred until
acceptance is obtained or the warranty period lapses. The Company standard license arrangement warrants that its products will function substantially in accordance with the documentation provided to
customers for periods ranging from three to twelve months. As of December31, 2001, the Company has not incurred any significant expenses related to warranty claims. 
No
single customer represented greater than 100% of total revenues during the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001. In
January2000, the Company sold its mainframe services and maintenance practice to an unrelated third-party consulting firm in exchange for royalties that will be received on
future revenue generated by customers using this product. Services and maintenance revenue associated with this 
49  product as a percentage of total services and maintenance revenue represented 75% for the year ended December31, 1999. The royalties are a declining percentage of the consulting firm
services and maintenance revenues generated from customers using our mainframe product, subject to a maximum of $425,000 per year. The percentages of revenue are: 200% for the first two years, 150%
for the third year, 100% for the fourth and fifth years and 50% for each year after the fifth year. The agreement is perpetual, but may be terminated at EXE option in the event of default by the
consulting firm. Royalties recognized in the years ended December31, 2000 and 2001 totaled $425,000 and $234,000, respectively, and are included as a component of services and maintenance
revenue. 
Software Development 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or
Otherwise Marketed, software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available
for general release to customers. The establishment of technological feasibility of the Company products and general release of such software have substantially coincided. As a result, software
development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant and, therefore, the Company has expensed all software development costs. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Foreign Currency 
Financial statements of foreign operations, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated using exchange rates in effect at period end for
assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. Foreign currency transaction gains losses were approximately $109,000, $848,000 and $495,000 for
the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits and investment grade corporate and government debt securities and money market funds. The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair market value. 
Marketable Securities 
The Company investments in debt securities are comprised of investment grade debt securities in accordance with the Company investment policy. Management
determines the appropriate
classification of investments in debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date. At December31, 2001, the Company debt securities are
classified as available for sale. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value, with the unrealized 
50  gains and losses, net of tax, reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates. The amortized cost of debt securities in this category
is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is included as a component of interest income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged
to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a component of interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification
method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included as a component of interest income. Securities available for sale with remaining maturities in excess of one
year at December31, 2001 have been classified as long-term securities. Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk principally consist of temporary cash investments and accounts
receivable, including receivables from license contracts. The Company places temporary cash investments with financial institutions and limits its exposure with any one financial institution. At
December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, no single customer represented greater than 100% of the total receivable balance. The Company billings are due upon receipt with collections generally
occurring within 30 to 60days, and the Company does not require collateral on accounts. A large portion of the Company customer base is composed of Fortune 1000 companies or foreign equivalents,
which the Company believes mitigates its credit risk. The Company continually evaluates the
creditworthiness of its customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains an allowance for losses on receivables based upon the expected collectibility of
all accounts receivable. Write-offs of receivables during the three years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were approximately $3,972,000, $6,508,000 and $5,441,000,
respectively. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. All property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method. The
estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows in years: Computer equipment
3-5 Furniture and equipment
5-7 Leasehold improvements
9-15 Other
3-7 LongLived Assets 
The Company evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets under SFAS No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, which requires impairment losses to be recognized for long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment
are present and when the future estimated undiscounted cash flows generated by those assets are not sufficient to recover the assets' carrying amount. 
51  Deferred Revenue 
Deferred revenue primarily represents amounts collected prior to complete performance of maintenance services. Deferred revenue also consists of amounts billed or
received in advance of satisfying revenue recognition criteria. 
Financial Instruments  The Company financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The
fair value of long-term debt approximates book value at December31, 2000 and 2001. 
Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans utilizing the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, because, as discussed in Note10, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires the use
of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. However, SFAS No123 requires disclosure of pro forma information regarding net income loss and
net income loss per share based on fair value accounting for stock-based compensation plans. Compensation expense associated with stock options is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the
underlying option. 
Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were approximately $3,071,000, $3,969,000 and $3,735,000 for the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and
2001, respectively. 
Earnings Per Share 
The Company computes net income loss per share in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No128, Earnings per Share. Basic net income loss per
common share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. 
Diluted
net income loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period and common equivalent shares consisting
of preferred stock, warrants and stock options using the treasury stock method, if dilutive. Diluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per common share for all periods presented
because all potentially dilutive securities were anti-dilutive. The following table sets forth anti-dilutive securities which have been excluded from diluted earnings per share
for the periods presented: As of December 31 1999

In June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No141, Business
Combinations, and No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with these
statements. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Application
of the nonamortization provisions of the statement is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately $31million or $007 per share in 2002 as a
result of nonamortization of existing goodwill. The Company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of 2002. The effect of the
impairment tests on the earnings and financial position of the Company have yet to be determined but may result in a significant charge to earnings in a future period. 
In
August2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No144 SFAS144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS144 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets. SFAS144 supersedes SFAS121 but retains the fundamental provisions of SFAS121 for irecognition/measurement of impairment of
long-lived assets to be held and used and iimeasurement of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sales. SFAS144 also supersedes the accounting and reporting
provisions of Accounting Principles Board No30 APB 30, Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for segments of a business to be disposed of but retains APB 30 requirement to
report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale.
SFAS144 is effective in 2002, but the Company does not expect adoption of the standard to have any material impact on the Company earnings and financial position. 
In
November2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a Staff Announcement Topic No.D-103 Announcement Topic, Income
Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of Pocket Expenses Incurred. This Announcement Topic establishes that reimbursements received
forout-of-pocket expenses should be characterized as revenue in the income statement. The Company 
53  is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of 2002. Currently, the Company records out-of-pocket expense reimbursements as a reduction of services and
maintenance expenses. Beginning in 2002, the Company will record these reimbursements as revenue, and this will result in increased revenues and increased cost of revenues. Comparative financial
statements for the prior years will be reclassified to conform to the new presentation. The Company is in the process of determining the effect on revenue and cost of revenue for these periods. The
application of this Announcement Topic will not result in any impact to operating or net income in any past or future periods. 
In
April2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued EITF 00-25, Vendor Income Statement
Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor Products. This EITF reached a consensus that consideration from a company to a reseller of a company
products is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price to that reseller and thereby should be characterized as a reduction of revenue in a company income statement. Beginning in 2002, the
Company will record any consideration paid to a reseller of the Company products as a reduction in revenue and this will result in decreased revenues and expenses. Comparative financial statements
for the prior years will be reclassified to conform to the new presentation. The effect, if implemented, for the year ended December31, 2001 would have been a reduction in revenue and expense
of approximately $06million. The application of this EITF will not result in any impact to operating or net income in any past or future periods. 
3. Acquisition of AllPoints Systems,Inc. 
On January25, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of AllPoints Systems,Inc. AllPoints. AllPoints provides warehouse and distribution
management computer software systems and installs these systems. The goal of the acquisition was to strengthen EXE position as a leading provider of fulfillment, warehousing and distribution
software by extending EXE presence in high volume, piece pick and parcel environments for the direct-to-consumer and e-commerce markets. The transaction was
completed in a stock-for-stock merger in which EXE issued 1,590,357 shares of EXE common stock and assumed options for an additional 409,606 shares of EXE common stock in
exchange for all of the outstanding securities of AllPoints. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and therefore, the results of operations of AllPoints are included in the results of the
Company from the date of acquisition. 
The
breakdown of the consideration, including transaction costs, exchanged for the outstanding securities of AllPoints was as follows: Fair market value of 1,590,357 shares of common stock 23,420,492 Fair market value of options to purchase 409,606 shares of common stock 5,503,447 Estimated intrinsic value of unvested stock options at consummation date related to future service 1,923,560 Transaction costs 1,618,109 Total combination cost 28,618,488 54 
The
aggregate purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired as follows: Goodwill 26,682,991 Developed technology 3,000,000 Assembled workforce 1,300,000 Liabilities assumed 3,206,136 Tangible assets acquired 841,633 28,618,488 The
estimated life of the intangibles acquired was six years. Upon completion of the transaction, EXE paid off and terminated AllPoints' $750,000 line of credit. 
The
following summary, prepared on an unaudited pro forma basis, reflects the condensed consolidated results of operations for the year ended December31, 2000 and 2001 assuming
AllPoints had been acquired at the beginning of the periods presented: Pro Forma Unaudited
Year Ended December 31 2000
2001 Revenue 122,581,448 95,766,154 Net loss 11,381,576 64,704,574 Net loss per common sharebasic and diluted 040 141 The
pro forma results are not indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisition had been in effect for the periods presented or for any future periods. 
Shortly
after the acquisition was completed, the e-commerce market declined significantly. During 2001, EXE was unable to sell new licenses for the AllPoints products, and
expenses associated with the AllPoints subsidiary, excluding amortization, exceeded revenues by approximately $24million. Additionally, approximately $49million of cash was used to
acquire the obligations and operate the AllPoints subsidiary during the twelve months ended December31, 2001. As a result, in November of 2001, EXE determined there would be no further sales
or marketing efforts regarding this product line, most of the remaining AllPoints employees were terminated, and the remaining $267million of intangibles associated with this acquisition were
judged to be impaired and written off. 
4. Marketable Securities 
There were $0 and $35,000 realized gains on the sale of securities available for sale during the years ended December31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The
net unrealized holding gain on marketable securities included as a separate component of stockholders' equity totaled approximately $38,000 and $175,000 as of December31, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. 
The
amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities at December31, 2001, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual
maturities

Effective January1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, FASB 133. The adoption of FASB 133 had no material impact on the Company financial
position or operating results for the year ended December31, 2001. 
In
January2001, the Company began a foreign currency-hedging program to hedge certain nonfunctional currency exposure. Forward currency exchange contracts are utilized by the
Company to reduce foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks with the goal of offsetting foreign currency transaction gains and losses recorded for accounting purposes with gains and losses
realized on the forward contracts. The Company does not hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
As
of December31, 2001, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts of $31million to sell Japanese Yen, $10million to sell Australian
Dollars and $40million to sell British Pounds Sterling which hedge net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses arising from the changes in the fair value of forward currency exchange
contracts are recognized as a component of other income expense. At December31, 2001, the current market settlement values of the forward contracts would result in a gain of approximately
$03million. 
6. Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment, stated at cost, consist of the following: As of December 31 2000
2001 Computer equipment 10,997,819 13,587,061 Furniture and equipment 4,896,958 5,268,485 Leasehold improvements 2,920,289 3,044,935 Other 495,630 517,225 19,310,696 22,417,706 Less accumulated depreciation 11,076,805 13,993,122 8,233,891 8,424,584 56 
Depreciation
expense for the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, was approximately $3,784,000, $4,175,000 and $3,850,000, respectively. 
7. Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets consist of the following: As of December 31 2000
2001 Intangible assets Developed and acquired technology 3,700,000 4,700,000 Assembled work force 1,350,000 1,350,000 Customer base 1,800,000 1,800,000 Goodwill 18,609,120 18,624,671 25,459,120 26,474,671 Less accumulated amortization 15,316,718 19,448,320 10,142,402 7,026,351 The
intangible assets arose primarily from the initial formation of EXE in September of 1997. Intangible assets associated with the initial formation of EXE are amortized over six years
based upon associated estimated revenue streams, except for assembled work force and goodwill that are amortized on a straight-line basis over a three- and six-year period,
respectively. On November21, 2001, EXE acquired intellectual property assets for a forecasting and replenishment application for $1million and additional consideration that is
dependent on sales of the application in 2002. The intangible associated with this acquisition will be amortized over three years. The
carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed if the facts and circumstances suggest that they may be permanently impaired. If a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow method
to the carrying value of intangible assets indicates that the intangible assets will not be recoverable, the assets will be reduced to their estimated recoverable value. During the year ended
December31, 2001, the intangibles acquired in the AllPoints acquisition were determined to be impaired and written off See Note3. In 2001, amortization of intangibles associated with
the AllPoints acquisition was approximately $43million and the impairment write-off was $267million. Total amortization of intangibles was $4,819,000, $4,616,000 and
$8,435,000 during the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. 
8. Debt 
The Company debt consists of the following: Year Ended December 31 2000
2001 Capital lease obligations 295,360 1,431,140 Less current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations 192,883 435,167 Long-term debt, net of current portion 102,477 995,973 57 
The
Company has entered into various capital lease arrangements to primarily obtain computer and network equipment for its operations. These agreements are typically for a
three-year term, with implied interest rates ranging from 5% to 8% and have no residual values. The minimum lease payments are as follows: Capital Leases 2002 652,822 2003 605,153 2004 434,948 2005 2,569 1,695,492 On
May10, 1999, the Company finalized a Loan and Security Agreement the Loan Agreement with a bank. In connection with finalizing the Loan Agreement, all previous borrowings
were paid off and all other financing agreements were terminated. The Loan Agreement provided for a revolving credit line and a $5million term loan. Borrowings under the revolving credit line
and term loan could not exceed $25million in the aggregate. Advances under the revolving credit line were subject to a specified advance rate as defined in the Loan Agreement and were secured
by all of the Company assets. The interest rate on borrowings under the Loan Agreement was adjusted monthly and was computed as the highest LIBOR rate in effect during each month plus 487% per
annum, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. Interest on borrowings under the Loan Agreement were payable on the last day of each month. In conjunction with the initial public offering, the
Company used $166million of the offering proceeds to payoff and terminate the Loan Agreement. 
On
August31, 1999 and September2, 1999, the Company received bridge loans the bridge loans totaling $3million from entities associated with Michael S. Dell
and Technology Crossover Ventures. The bridge loans were issued in five separate convertible promissory notes with the principal and all accrued interest on each note due on the earlier of
February28, 2000 or, at the payee demand, any time after September30, 1999. Each note interest rate was 10% per annum. The bridge loans were cancelled on September29, 1999
as partial consideration for the issuance of $19million of SeriesD preferred stock.

December31, 2001, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward and research and development credits of approximately $725million and $06million,
respectively, both of which will begin to expire in the year 2013. The Company also had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $114million in foreign jurisdictions. The Company has
established a valuation allowance to reserve its net deferred tax assets at December31, 2000 and 2001 due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of future taxable income. 10. Stock Options 
In October1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan which replaced all previous plans of Neptune and
Dallas Systems. Under the 1997 Plan, an aggregate of 12,000,000 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance. The 1997 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options ISOs to employees
of the Company and nonqualified stock options NQSOs to employees or consultants. Exercise prices for ISOs may not be less than fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors in the
absence of a public market and exercise prices for NQSOs may be greater or less than fair market on the date of grant. The options generally vest and become exercisable ratably over a
four-year period and expire after ten years unless determined otherwise by the Board of Directors. Under
the 1997 Plan, in the event of a change of control, the Board shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the vesting of all options that have not vested as of the
date of the change of 
60  control and/or establish an earlier date for the expiration of the exercise of an option. In addition, in the event of a change of control of the Company, the Board shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, subject to and conditioned upon a sale of the Company: ato arrange for the successor company or other entity to assume all of the rights and obligations of the Company under
the 1997 Plan or bto terminate the 1997 Plan and ipay to all optionees cash with respect to those options that are vested as of the date of the sale of the Company in an amount
equal to the difference between the option price and the fair market value of a share of common stock determined as of the date the 1997 Plan is terminated multiplied by the number of options that
are vested as of the date of the sale of the Company which are held by the optionee as of the date of the sale of the Company, iiarrange for the exchange of all options for options to
purchase common stock in the successor corporation, or iiidistribute to each optionee other property in an amount equal to and in the same form as the optionee would have received from the
successor corporation if the optionee had owned the shares subject to options that are vested as of the date of the sale of Company rather than the option at the time of the sale of the Company. The
form of payment or distribution to the optionee pursuant to this section shall be by the Board in its sole discretion. 
In
October1997, the Company adopted the Non-Employee Directors Plan the Directors Plan. Under the Directors Plan, an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock are
authorized for issuance. The
Directors Plan provides for the grant of a specified number of NQSOs to non-employee directors of the Company as defined in the Directors Plan at exercise prices equal to the fair market
value of the Company stock on the date of grant. The options vest over four years. At December31, 2000 and 2001, 150,000 and 200,000, respectively, options were outstanding under the
Directors Plan. Options outstanding under the Directors Plan had weighted average exercise prices of $1033 and $1075 per share at December31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. As of
December31, 2000 and 2001, 37,500 and 75,000 of these options were exercisable at a weighted average price of $767 and $900 per share, respectively. 
In
January2001, in connection with the AllPoints acquisition see Note3, the Company assumed the former AllPoints Systems 1996 Stock Option Plan the AllPoints Plan.
Under the AllPoints Plan, grants were in the form of incentive stock options or nonqualified options. Vesting periods were determined by the Board of Directors on the date of grant. In conjunction
with the acquisition, a portion of these options became fully vested and the remaining options vest ratably over the original four to five year vesting periods. The Company does not intend to grant
any additional options under the AllPoints Plan. 
61  Stock
option transactions under the 1997 Plan for the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, including the assumption of the AllPoints Plan in 2001, are summarized as

weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted under the 1997 Plan during the year ended December31, 1999 and prior to the completion of the Company
initial public offering in 2000 using a minimum value option pricing model was $071 and $445 per option, respectively. For options granted after the completion of the Company initial public
offering through December31, 2000, the weighted average grant-date fair value was $838. For options granted during 2001, the weighted average grant-date fair value was
$547. 
At
December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, 1,542,070, 2,187,659 and 2,900,694 options were exercisable. The weighted average exercise price of options exercisable was $322, $394 and
$513 at December31, 1999,
2000 and 2001, respectively. The remaining estimated contractual life of the 9,615,037 options outstanding at December31, 2001, is approximately 85years. Options outstanding at
December31, 2001 have exercise prices ranging from $073 to $1800. 
During
1998, the Company granted 102,656 options at $200 per share, outside the plans to a former employee. The employee exercised those options in 1999. 
SFAS
No123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, requires the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share information computed as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options granted under the fair value method set forth in SFAS No123. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model and the following weighted-average assumptions for 1999, 2000 and 2001: a risk-free interest rate of 600% in 1999, 641% in 2000 and 407% in 2001, no dividend, an
expected life of three to four years, and a 
62  volatility of zero for grants prior to the Company initial public offering and 124 for grants subsequent to the Company initial public offering in 2000 and 118 for grants in 2001. Pro forma net
loss and loss per share for 1999, 2000 and 2001 would have been $26,833,186 $167 per share, $5,279,679 $020 per share and $69,061,210 $152 per share, respectively, determined as if the
Company had accounted for its stock options granted in 1999, 2000 and 2001 under the fair value method set forth in SFAS No123. 
The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. In addition, because options vest over several years and additional option grants are
expected, the effects of these hypothetical calculations are not likely to be representative of similar future calculations. 
11. Deferred Compensation 
The Company recorded deferred compensation of approximately $729,000 in 1999 for differences between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of the Company
common stock on the grant date for certain options granted during 1999. The Company granted options to purchase 280,250 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $300 in 1999. Such exercise
price was less than the deemed fair value of the Company common stock on the date of grant. The deemed fair value of the Company common stock on the individual grant dates ranged from $496 to
$702. 
The
Company recorded additional deferred compensation of approximately $4,601,000 in 2000 for the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of the Company common
stock on the grant date. The Company granted options to purchase 1,463,225 shares of common stock with exercise prices ranging from $300 to $800. Such exercise prices were less than the deemed fair
value of the Company common stock on the grant date. The deemed fair value of the Company common stock on the individual grant dates ranged from $775 to $850. The
Company assumed an additional 409,606 options for shares of the Company common stock in the AllPoints acquisition See Note3 and recorded additional deferred compensation
of approximately $19million for the estimated intrinsic value of unvested stock options related to future services. Additionally, the Company recorded additional deferred compensation of
approximately $666,000 in 2001 for the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of the Company common stock on the grant date. This deferred compensation resulted from the
grants of options to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock to an executive officer with an exercise price of $550. The
deferred compensation is being amortized ratably over the vesting period of the individual options, generally three to four years. Compensation expense recognized in 1999, 2000 and
2001 totaled approximately $282,000, $1,586,000 and $1,400,000, respectively. 
63  12. Related Party Transactions 
The Company also has various advances to officers and stockholders of the Company. The total balance of these receivables at December31, 2000 and 2001 was
$52,574 and $31,642, respectively. Additionally, the Company has long-term full recourse notes receivable from employees and stockholders which bear interest of 85% and have a remaining
balance of $958,259 and $1,173,403 at December31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. These notes are secured by 78,333 shares of and 25,000 options for the Company common stock and are subject to
forgiveness in the event of termination of employment due to death or disability, or if termination happens without cause or, in certain cases, for good reason following a change in control. 
13. Lease Commitments 
The Company leases certain facilities and property and equipment for use in operations. In May1998, the Company entered into a lease for office space for
the North American operations. The lease was subsequently amended in November2001 and includes initial rental free periods for the first eight months, a lease term for approximately seventeen
years, and rate escalation clauses in November2006 and November2011. The Company recognizes the total minimum lease payments as an expense on the
straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease has two five-year renewal options that are at a rate not less than 95% of the then-prevailing market rate for
comparable premises. 
The

Common Stock 
The Company completed its initial public offering of 8,000,000 shares of its common stock pursuant to a Registration Statement on FormS-1 on

fee and offering expenses of approximately $68million. 
All
ClassA common stock was renamed as common stock and all ClassB common stock converted into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis as
a result of closing the offering. The Company is now authorized to issue 150,000,000 shares of common stock. 
Preferred Stock 
As a result of the Company initial public offering, all outstanding shares of SeriesA through D preferred stock automatically converted into 17,687,562
shares of common stock. The Company is now authorized to issue a total of 20million shares of preferred stock. In
addition to conversion rights, the SeriesA through D preferred stock had voting rights equal to common stock, certain liquidation preferences and dividend rights equivalent to
the common stockholders. Activity relating to preferred stock including shares issued, proceeds from sale and conversion is presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders'
Equity. 
Warrants 
In December1998, and in connection with obtaining certain financing, the Company issued warrants to acquire up to 50,000 shares of the Company common
stock. The warrants had an exercise price of $750 per share, were exercisable upon issuance and expired the later of December31, 2001, or 
65  two years after the completion of an initial public offering of the Company common stock but in no event later than December31, 2002. The warrants were valued at $75,000, which was recorded
as additional interest expense over the term of the loan agreement. The warrants were exercised in January2001. 
In
March1999, the Company entered into a two year sales and marketing agreement with an independent third party. The Company and the third party each have a
non-exclusive right to market and resell the other party products. As part of the agreement, the Company issued warrants to purchase the Company common stock with an exercise price of
$4 per share, of which, 330,000 of the warrants were immediately vested, exercisable and nonforfeitable. The remaining 330,000 of the warrants were to vest at a rate of 110,000 warrants for each
$2,000,000 of net license revenue the Company recognizes on sales of the Company products sold by the third party. The fair value of $640,000 for the 330,000 warrants, which vested immediately, was
amortized to operating expense over the term of the agreement. Through June2000, the 330,000 warrants which vest over time were marked to fair value at the end of each accounting period, and
the remeasured value was amortized to operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Prior to June30, 2000, warrants to purchase 110,000 shares of the
Company common stock had vested as a result of the Company recognizing $2,000,000 of net license revenue from sales of the Company products sold by the third party. In June2000, the
Company and the third party amended the sales and marketing
agreement such that the unvested warrants to purchase 220,000 shares of the Company common stock were canceled. The Company recorded expense of approximately $988,000 and $1,176,000 for the warrants
during the years ended December31, 1999 and 2000, respectively. The fair value of the warrants was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 1999
and 2000 respectively: risk-free interest rate of 460% and 516%; dividend yield of zero; volatility of 85%; and a warrant life of five years. The warrants were exercised in
December2000. 
In
October1999, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with an independent third party. The Company issued 375,000 warrants to purchase the Company common stock to the
third party for consulting services rendered. The warrants were immediately vested, exercisable and non-forfeitable with an exercise price of $4 per share. The fair value of the warrants
of approximately $2,051,000 was recorded as expense in 1999. The fair value of the warrants was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
risk-free interest rate of 511%; dividend yield of zero; volatility of 85%; and a warrant life of three years. The warrants were exercised in August2000. Note Receivable from Stockholder 
In connection with the acquisition of AllPoints in January2001 See Note3, the Company received a $211,750 full recourse note receivable from a
former stockholder of AllPoints which bears interest at 587% per annum. Under the terms of the note, the note was secured by the Company stock and unpaid principal and interest is due on
December28, 2005, or an earlier date upon the occurrence of certain events, including termination of employment. In January2002, the stockholder surrendered 95,440 shares of common
stock, which had a fair value equal to the carrying value of the note on the settlement date, and the note was cancelled. 
66  16. Contingencies 
The Company is involved in various legal actions and claims which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the final disposition of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or results of operations. 17. Employee Severance and Lease Abandonment 
During the year ended December31, 2001, the Company announced and implemented plans to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency. Loss on lease
abandonment and employee severance and other facility closure costs was $143million for the year ended December31, 2001. These charges included

related costs for the termination of 233 employees, $03million for disposal of fixed assets, and $03million for abandonment of leased equipment and other facility closure costs. The
Company has recorded approximately $33million of cash charges against the reserves established for these 2001 cost reduction actions. The remaining liability at
December31, 2001 is approximately $110million and is expected to be paid through 2007. These reserves include estimates pertaining to sublease rates, vacancy periods, employee
separation costs, and settlement of contractual obligations. Although the Company does not anticipate significant changes, the actual costs may differ from these estimates. 
In
August1999, the Company implemented a restructuring plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency. The Company recorded a pretax charge of approximately
$20million for its restructuring plan. The Company recorded liabilities associated with the restructuring in the amounts of approximately $07million for severance and other employee
related costs for the termination of 97 services, sales, development and administrative employees, $08million for the abandonment of certain leased office space less estimated sublease
rentals at the Company North American and Australian facilities, $02million for the abandonment of leased equipment, and $03million for the disposal of other fixed assets. The
Company recorded approximately $13million, $04million and $02million of cash charges against the original restructuring reserve during the year ended December31,
