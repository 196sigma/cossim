REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Consolidated Graphics,Inc.: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consolidated Graphics,Inc. and subsidiaries as of March31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended March31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Graphics,Inc. and
subsidiaries for the year ended March31, 2002, were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on such consolidated financial
statements, before the revision described in Note3 to the consolidated financial statements, in their report dated May17, 2002. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated Graphics,Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended March31, 2004, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As
discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Graphics,Inc. and subsidiaries for the year ended March31, 2002, were audited by other auditors
who have ceased operations. As described in Note3 to the consolidated financial statements, these consolidated financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by Consolidated
Graphics,Inc. and subsidiaries as of April1, 2002. In our opinion, the transitional disclosures for the year ended March31, 2002 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged
to audit, review or apply any procedures to the consolidated financial statements of Consolidated Graphics,Inc. and subsidiaries for the year ended March31, 2002, other than with
respect to such disclosures. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on such consolidated financial statements for the year ended March31, 2002, taken as a
whole.

CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS,INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages    
1. BUSINESS 
Consolidated Graphics,Inc. collectively with its subsidiaries referred to as the Company is a leading national provider of commercial printing
services with 65 printing facilities in 25 states and is recognized as the largest sheet-fed and half-web commercial printing company in the United States. The Company is
focused on adding value to its printing businesses by providing the financial and operational strengths, management support and technological advantages associated with a national organization. The
Company printing businesses maintain their own sales, customer service, estimating and planning, prepress, production and accounting departments. The Company corporate
headquarters staff provides support to its printing businesses in such areas as human resources, purchasing and management information systems. The Company also maintains centralized treasury, risk
management, tax and consolidated financial reporting activities. 
The
majority of the Company sales are derived from commercial printing services, which include electronic prepress, printing, finishing, storage and delivery of high quality,
custom-designed products. Examples of such products include high-quality, multicolor marketing materials, product and capability brochures, point-of-purchase
displays, direct mail pieces, shareholder communications, catalogs and training manuals. The Company also serves its customers by providing a variety of print-related services, including fulfillment
and mailing services and Internet-based software solutions and electronic media services through CGXmedia. 
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER INFORMATION 
Accounting Policies 
The accounting policies of the Company reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The more
significant of such accounting policies are described below. 
Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, the Company operations constitute one reportable segment because all of its
printing businesses operate in the commercial printing industry and exhibit similar economic characteristics. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
the use of certain estimates and assumptions by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and relies on historical experience
and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances to determine such estimates. Because uncertainties with respect to estimates and assumptions are inherent in the
preparation of financial statements, actual results could differ from these estimates. ReclassificationCertain reclassifications of prior periods' data have been made to conform with the current period reporting. 
29  Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. 
Revenue Recognition and Accounts ReceivableThe Company recognizes revenue upon delivery of each job. Losses, if any, on jobs
are recognized at the earliest date such amount is determinable. The Company derives the majority of its revenues from sales and services to a broad and diverse group of customers with no individual
customer accounting for more than 10% of the Company revenues during the years ended March31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the
expected collectibility of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are reflected net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,448 and $1,637 at
March31, 2004 and 2003. 
InventoriesInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first-in, first-out
method for raw materials and the specific identification method for work in progress and finished goods. The carrying values of inventories are set forth below: March 31 2004
2003 Raw materials 10,051 10,283 Work in progress 20,054 15,480 Finished goods 2,623 2,666 32,728 28,429 Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsEffective April1, 2002, the Company determines the realization of goodwill
and other intangibles in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and its other long-lived assets in
accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Under SFAS No142, the Company
determines fair value using capitalization of earnings estimates and market valuation multiples for each reporting unit. Under SFAS No144, the Company compares the carrying value of
long-lived assets to its projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets, as well as evaluates other factors such as business trends and general economic
conditions. In the event that the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value over the
asset fair value. Prior to April1, 2002, the Company evaluated its property, equipment, and intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No121, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
30  Accrued LiabilitiesThe significant components of accrued liabilities are as follows: March 31 2004
2003 Compensation and benefits 27,669 20,098 Manufacturing materials and services 7,200 5,483 Sales, property and other taxes 15,902 11,132 Other 15,814 9,100 66,585 45,813 Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Stock-Based CompensationIn December2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, which amends SFAS No123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, by providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS No148 amends the provisions of SFAS No123 to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results of operations. The
Company only element of stock-based compensation is derived pursuant to the Consolidated Graphics,Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan, which has been approved by the
Company shareholders. Under the Plan, employees of the Company and certain non-employee members of the Company Board of Directors have been, or may be, granted options to purchase
shares of the Company common stock at a price not less than the market price of the stock at the date of grant. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No148 as of
March31, 2003, however, as permitted under SFAS No123, continues to use the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly, no compensation expense or liability is recognized for options issued under the
Plan in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since all options were granted at the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. 
Had
the Company used the fair-value-based method of accounting for the Plan prescribed by SFAS No123 and charged compensation expense against income over the vesting
period based on the fair value 
31  of
options at the date of grant, net income loss and earnings loss per share as reported would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts: Year Ended March 31 2004
2003
2002 Net income loss as reported 19,997 87,315 16,680 Less: pro forma compensation expense 2,085 2,493 2,226 Pro forma net income loss 17,912 89,808 14,454 Basic Earnings Loss Per Share Net income loss as reported 149 658 127 Less: pro forma compensation expense 15 18 21 Pro forma net income loss 134 676 106 Diluted Earnings Loss Per Share Net income loss as reported 144 647 125 Less: pro forma compensation expense 14 17 21 Pro forma net income loss 130 664 104 The
pro forma compensation expense may not be representative of future amounts because options vest over several years and additional options may be granted in future years. For purposes
of
determining pro forma compensation expense, the Company determined the weighted-average fair value of options on the grant date $944 in 2004, $926 in 2003 and $1096 in 2002 by utilizing the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following key assumptions: 2004
2003
2002 Dividend yield Expected volatility
339 532 413 Average risk-free interest rate
32 38 50 Average expected life
50 yrs.
50 yrs.
90 yrs. The
Black-Scholes model used by the Company to calculate the fair value of options granted, as well as other currently accepted option valuation models, were developed to estimate the
fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable options without vesting and/or trading restrictions, which significantly differ from the provisions associated with the Company stock option awards.
These models also require highly subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values. Accordingly, management
does not believe this model provides a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company stock option awards.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  SFAS No149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, was issued in
April2003 and amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS
No133. SFAS No149 was effective for contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003, and for hedging 
32 
relationships
designated after June30, 2003. SFAS No149 did not have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations for and as of the period ended
March31, 2004. 
SFAS
No150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, was issued in
May2003 and requires issuers to classify as liabilities or assets in some circumstances three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer. SFAS
No150 was effective for interim periods beginning after June15, 2003. SFAS No150 did not have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations
for and as of the period ended March31, 2004. 
The
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB initially issued Interpretation FIN No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, in January2003, then revised and reissued FIN No46 in December2003 FIN No46R. This interpretation requires that a company that
controls another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate such controlled entity. FIN No46 and FIN No46R did not have a material impact on the
Company financial position or results of operations as and for the period ended March31, 2004. 
Other Information 
Supplemental Cash Flow InformationThe consolidated statements of cash flows provide information about
the Company sources and uses of cash and exclude the effects of non-cash transactions. The Company significant non-cash transactions primarily include the assumption and/or
issuance of debt related to the acquisition of certain printing businesses see Note4. Acquisitions and the issuance of term equipment notes related to the purchase of machinery and equipment
see Note6. Long-Term Debt. The Company issued debt totaling $5,129 pursuant to acquisitions in the year ended March31, 2002 and issued term equipment notes to finance the
purchase of certain new machinery and equipment totaling $7,506, $6,014 and $5,855 during the years ended March31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 
The
Company paid or received cash for interest and income taxes, net of refunds, totaling $7,227 and $2,460 in 2004, $10,286 and $534in 2003, and $14,767 and $64 in 2002. Earnings Loss Per ShareBasic earnings loss per share are calculated by dividing net income loss by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings loss per share reflect net income loss divided by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive stock options outstanding. 
Related Party TransactionsIn the normal course of business, the Company leases certain real estate from individuals who
formerly owned an acquired printing business and are now employed by the Company. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Company financial instruments consist of cash, trade receivables, trade payables and
debt obligations. The Company does not currently hold or issue derivative financial instruments. The Company believes that the fair value of its variable rate debt obligations, which totaled $43,431
and $98,088 at March31, 2004 and 2003, approximated their recorded values. The Company estimates that the fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations totaling $68,038 at March31,
2004 was $69,717 and that the fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations totaling $65,674 at March31, 2003 was $67,268. Estimates of fair value are based on interest rates for the same or
similar debt offered to the Company having the same or similar maturities and collateral requirements. 
33  Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are
primarily trade accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited because the Company printing businesses provide services to a large, diverse
group of customers in various geographical regions. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for extensions of credit. The Company
cash deposits are held in large, national financial institutions. 
3. ACCOUNTING CHANGE 
Effective April1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
which required it to discontinue amortizing goodwill, perform an initial transitional impairment test and conduct annual impairment tests to determine if the remaining balance of goodwill of each of
its reporting units should be reduced to reflect its estimated fair value. Prior to its adoption of SFAS No142, the Company periodically evaluated whether the remaining balance of goodwill
was recoverable
by assessing current and future levels of income and cash flows on an undiscounted basis, as well as other factors, such as business trends and general market conditions. The Company determined that
each of its individual printing businesses constitutes a stand-alone reporting unit under SFAS No142. The Company determines fair value under SFAS No142 using capitalization of
earnings estimates and market valuation multiples. A number of factors could cause the Company to further impair its goodwill balance at the date of its annual impairment test, which is
March31. These factors include a decline in the financial performance of an individual reporting unit due to adverse business developments and/or changes in general market conditions, as well
as a decline in market valuation multiples. As of April1, 2002, net goodwill balances attributable to each of the Company reporting units were tested for impairment by comparing the fair
value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Based on these impairment tests the Company recognized a transitional impairment charge of $74,376, net of deferred tax benefit totaling $15,379,
which is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the accompanying consolidated income statement. 
As
a result of its annual valuation test, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $38,033 for the year ended March31, 2003, which is reflected as
goodwill impairment in the accompanying consolidated income statement. The impairment resulted principally from the impact that the continued weakness in printing industry conditions and other
negative economic factors had on the Company reporting units. 
34  Had
the provisions of SFAS No142 been in effect for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, net income loss and earnings loss per share
as reported would have been reported on the following pro forma basis: Year Ended March 31 2004
2003
2002 Net income loss as reported 19,997 87,315 16,680 Add: cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax 74,376 Add: goodwill amortization 5,373 Less: tax benefit of deductible goodwill amortization 767 Pro forma net income loss 19,997 12,939 21,286 Basic Earnings Loss Per Share Net income loss as reported 149 658 127 Add: cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax 560 Add: goodwill amortization 41 Less: tax benefit of deductible goodwill amortization 06 Pro forma net income loss 149 98 162 Diluted Earnings Loss Per Share Net income loss as reported 144 647 125 Add: cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax 551 Add: goodwill amortization 40 Less: tax benefit of deductible goodwill amortization 06 Pro forma net income loss 144 96 159 4. ACQUISITIONS 
All of the Company acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Revenues and expenses of the acquired businesses have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements beginning on their respective dates of acquisition. The allocation of purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities is based on
estimates of fair market value and may be prospectively revised if and when additional information the Company is awaiting concerning certain asset and liability valuations is obtained, provided that
such information is received no later than one year after the date of acquisition. Contingent transaction consideration pursuant to earnout agreements is accrued as an additional cost of the
transaction when payment thereof is deemed to be probable by the Company. 
During
fiscal 2004, the Company acquired for cash totaling $10,042 the business and assets of six companies. The allocation of the purchase price of the businesses acquired include
current assets of $3,503, property and equipment of $8,699, and other assets of $1,661, less current liabilities of $3,821. 
During
fiscal 2003, the Company acquired for cash totaling $4,205 the business and assets of two companies located near Baltimore, Maryland. The allocation of the purchase price of the
businesses acquired include current assets of $3,627, property and equipment of $1,012, and other assets of $655, less current liabilities of $1,089. 
35  During
fiscal 2002, the Company acquired for cash totaling $11,231 the business and assets of three companies. The allocation of the purchase price of the businesses acquired include
current assets of $11,704 and property and equipment of $9,990, less current liabilities of $5,334, and issued debt totaling $5,129.

5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The costs of major renewals and betterments are capitalized; repairs and maintenance
costs are expensed when incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. 
The
following is a summary of the Company property and equipment and their estimated useful lives: March 31 Description

6. LONG-TERM DEBT 
The following is a summary of the Company long-term debt as of: March 31 2004
2003 Bank credit facilities 35,563 89,040 Term equipment notes 67,772 65,317 Other 8,134 9,405 111,469 163,762 Lesscurrent portion 13,204 20,595 98,265 143,167 On
November10, 2003, the Company completed an amendment and restatement to its then existing bank credit facility as amended and restated, the Credit Agreement. The Credit
Agreement is composed of a $150,000 revolving credit facility that will mature in July2007. Prior to its amendment and restatement, the bank credit facility was composed of a $175,000
five-year revolving credit line and an amortizing $50,000 term loan the Term Loan with final maturity scheduled in December2005. Proceeds from the Credit Agreement were used to
pay the outstanding balance on the Term Loan, which totaled $20,000 as of the date of the amendment and restatement. At March31, 2004, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement were
$31,000 and accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 304%. In connection with the amendment and restatement to the bank credit facility, the Company incurred additional financing costs totaling
$480, which are being amortized over the remaining term of the Credit Agreement, and expensed $400 of previously deferred financing costs as required under generally accepted accounting principles. 
The
proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Agreement can be used to repay certain indebtedness, finance certain acquisitions, provide for working capital and general corporate
purposes, and subject to certain restrictions, repurchase the Company common stock. Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company assets other
than real estate and certain equipment subject to term equipment notes and other financings. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrue interest, at the Company option, at either 1the
London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a margin of 125% to 200%, or 2an alternate base rate based upon the greater of the agent bank prime lending rate or the Federal Funds
effective rate plus 50% plus a margin of up to 75%. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee on available but unused amounts ranging from 275% to 375% annually. The interest rate
margin and the commitment fee are based upon certain financial performance measures set forth in the Credit Agreement and are redetermined quarterly. At March31, 2004, the applicable interest
rates margin was 125% and the applicable commitment fee was 275%. 
The
Company is subject to certain covenants and restrictions and must meet certain financial tests under the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with such covenants,
restrictions and financial tests at March31, 2004. 
In
addition, the Company maintains two auxiliary revolving credit facilities each an Auxiliary Bank Facility and collectively the Auxiliary Bank Facilities with commercial banks.
Both Auxiliary Bank Facilities are unsecured, have a maximum borrowing capacity of $5,000 and expire in November2004. At 
37  March31,
2004 borrowings outstanding under the Auxiliary Bank Facilities totaled $4,563 and accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 235%. Because the Company has the ability to
refinance its Auxiliary Bank Facilities and plans to do so annually, the borrowings outstanding are classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
The
Company term equipment notes consist primarily of notes payable pursuant to financing agreements between the Company and various lenders the Lender Notes and between the
Company and the finance affiliates of two printing equipment manufacturers the Equipment Notes. In March2004, the Company issued Lender Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $3,989 and
utilized the proceeds thereof to retire all of the outstanding Equipment Notes with one of the finance affiliates. At March31, 2004, outstanding borrowings under the Lender Notes totaled
$44,581 and accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 548%. The Lender Notes provide for fixed monthly principal payments plus interest for defined periods of up to eight years from the date of
issuance, most ending with a balloon payment at maturity, and are secured by certain equipment of the Company. At March31, 2004, outstanding borrowings under the Equipment Notes totaled
$21,471 and accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 614%. The Equipment Notes provide for fixed payments of principal and interest for defined periods of up to ten years from the date of
issuance and are secured by the equipment concurrently purchased from the respective manufacturer. The remaining balance of term equipment notes totaling $1,720 primarily consists of various secured
debt obligations assumed by the Company in connection with certain prior year acquisitions. The Company is not
subject to any significant financial covenants in connection with any of the term equipment notes; however, the Credit Agreement places certain limitations on the amount of additional term note
obligations the Company may incur in the future. 
The
Company remaining debt obligations consist of a promissory note totaling $3,503, industrial revenue bonds totaling $3,955 and various other debt totaling $676. The Company does not
have any significant financial covenants or restrictions associated with these other debt obligations. 
The
principal payment requirements by fiscal year under the Company debt obligations are: 2005$13,204; 2006$12,570; 2007$13,617;
2008$56,988; 2009$5,756; and thereafter$9,334. 
7. INCOME TAXES 
The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following: Year Ended March 31 2004
2003
2002 Current 6,451 276 1,590 Deferred 6,240 4,008 9,530 12,691 4,284 11,120 38 
The
provision for income taxes differs from an amount computed at the federal statutory rate as follows: Year Ended March 31 2004
2003
2002 Provision benefit at the federal statutory rate 11,441 3,030 9,730 State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 351 757 363 Non-deductible expenses Amortization of goodwill 1,458 Goodwill impairment 6,976 Other 899 419 431 12,691 4,284 11,120 Deferred
income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts as measured based on
enacted tax laws and regulations. The Company records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount the Company expects to realize. The Company considers
the amount of taxable income available in carryback years and future taxable income, among other factors, in assessing the
potential need for a valuation allowance. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows: March 31 2004
2003
2002 Deferred income tax liabilities Property and equipment 59,464 53,474 54,234 Goodwill and other 3,609 5,931 12,103 Total deferred income tax liabilities 55,855 47,543 66,337 Deferred income tax assets Accounts receivable and inventory 645 418 1,356 Accruals not currently deductible 5,514 3,669 3,797 Total deferred income tax assets 6,159 4,087 5,153 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Operating LeasesThe Company has entered into various noncancelable operating leases primarily related
to facilities and equipment used in the ordinary course of its business. The Company
incurred total operating lease expense of $14,748, $13,627 and $11,252 for the years ended March31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 
The
Company operating lease obligations by fiscal year are as follows: 2005
2006
2007
2008
2009
Thereafter Operating lease obligations 14,050 11,671 9,879 8,572 5,502 12,932 39 
Contingent Transaction ConsiderationThe Company has entered into earnout agreements in connection with certain prior year
acquisitions of printing businesses. If the acquired printing businesses generate operating profits in excess of pre-determined targets, the Company may be obligated to make additional
cash payments. As of March31, 2004, the Company was contingently obligated through fiscal 2005 to make additional cash payments of up to $1,550. Based on current operating levels, the Company
expects that the actual cash payments pursuant to these contractual obligations will be less than the maximum amount indicated. 
Letters of CreditIn connection with the assumption of obligations under outstanding industrial revenue bonds related to
certain prior year acquisitions of printing businesses, which are reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had three letters of credit outstanding as of
March31, 2004 for a combined total of $8,131. These letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms of our Credit Agreement, which expires in July2007, and we may be required to
obtain replacement letters of credit at that time. 
Insurance ProgramsThe Company maintains third-party insurance coverage in amounts and against the risks it believes are
reasonable in its circumstances. The Company is self-insured against most workers compensation claims and for a significant component of its group health insurance programs. For these
exposures, the Company accrues expected loss amounts which are determined using a combination of its historical loss experience and subjective assessment of its future loss exposure, together with
advice provided by administrators and consulting actuaries. The estimates of expected loss amounts are subject to uncertainties arising from various sources, including changes in claims reporting
patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation and economic conditions. Although the Company believes that the accrued estimated loss amounts are reasonable under the
circumstances, significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect our risk exposure, insurance obligations and future expense. 
Legal MattersFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
its business. Currently, there are no legal proceedings or claims pending against the Company that management believes will have a material adverse effect upon the Company financial position or
results of operations.
