INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
Core Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Columbus, Ohio
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Core
Molding Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included
the consolidated financial statement schedules listed in the Index at .
These consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
consolidated financial statement schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Core Molding Technologies,
Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated
financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.
On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133 Accounting for Derivatives.
As discussed in Note 16, the 2002 consolidated financial statements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS FORMATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Core Molding Technologies, Inc. Core Molding, the Company was
formed in 1996 for the purpose of acquiring substantially all the assets and
assuming certain of the liabilities of Columbus Plastics Operation Columbus
Plastics, an operating unit of Navistar International Transportation Corp.
now known as International Truck & Engine Corporation, International. In
October 2001, the Company acquired certain assets of Airshield Corporation the
Airshield Asset Acquisition, see Note 4. As a result of this acquisition, the
Company expanded its fiberglass molding capabilities to include the spray-up,
hand-lay-up and vacuum assisted resin infused molding processes.
The Company operates in one business segment as a compounder of sheet
molding composites SMC and molder of fiberglass reinforced plastics. The
Company produces and sells both SMC compound and molded products for varied
markets, including medium and heavy-duty trucks, automotive, recreational
vehicles and commercial and industrial products.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries after elimination of all
material intercompany accounts, transactions and profits. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue from product sales is recognized at the
time products are shipped and title transfers. Allowances for returned products
and other credits are estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized. Tooling
revenue is recognized when the customer approves the tool and accepts ownership.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash is held primarily in one bank.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in,
first-out or market. The Company had recorded an allowance for slow moving and
obsolete inventory of $325,000 at December 31, 2003 and $278,000 at December 31,
2002.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are
recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. The carrying amount of long-lived assets
is evaluated annually to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or

Ranges of estimated useful lives for computing depreciation are as

Machinery and equipment                3-15 years
Tools, dies and patterns               3-5 years
Depreciation expense was $2,153,000, $1,983,000 and $2,010,000 for
2003, 2002, and 2001.
In 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately $33,000, $0 and $37,000 of
interest costs were capitalized in property, plant and equipment.
DEFERRED GAIN - Deferred gains resulted from sales leaseback
transactions that occurred in 1997 and 1998 and are being amortized over the
lease period.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets consist primarily of property and
equipment and goodwill. The recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by
an analysis of operating results and consideration of other significant events
or changes in the business environment. The Company evaluates whether impairment
exists for property and equipment on the basis of undiscounted expected future
cash flows from operations before interest. For goodwill, the Company evaluates
whether impairment exists on the basis of estimated fair value of the reporting
unit. If impairment exists, the carrying amount of the long-lived assets is
reduced to its estimated fair value, less any costs associated with the final
settlement. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, there was no
impairment of the Company long-lived assets.
SELF-INSURANCE - The Company is self-insured with respect to most of
its medical and dental claims and workers' compensation claims. The Company has
recorded an estimated liability for self-insured medical and dental claims
incurred but not reported and worker compensation claims incurred but not
reported at December 31, 2003 and 2002 of $860,000 and $650,000, respectively.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The Company financial
instruments consist of a mortgage backed security investment, long term debt, an
interest rate swap, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The carrying
amount of these financial instruments approximated their fair value.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - The Company has significant transactions
with four customers see Note 3, which together comprised 91%, 87% and 90% of
total sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively and 82% and 93% of the accounts
receivable balances at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition. The
Company maintains reserves for potential bad debt losses, and such bad debt
losses have been historically within the Company expectations. Export sales,
including sales to Canada and Mexico, for products provided to certain
customers' manufacturing and service locations totaled 18%, 24% and 26% of total
sales for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
EARNINGS LOSS PER COMMON SHARE - Basic earnings loss per common
share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings loss per common share are
computed similarly but include the effect of the assumed exercise of dilutive
stock options under the treasury stock method.
The computation of basic and diluted earnings loss per common share
is as follows                                     YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Entities, which was replaced by FIN No. 46 Revised December 2003,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN No. 46R. FIN No. 46 requires
consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that meet
certain requirements. FIN No. 46R changes the effective date of FIN 46 for
certain entities. Public companies shall apply either FIN No. 46 or FIN No.
46R to their interest in special purpose entities SPEs as of the first
interim or annual period ending after December 15, 2003. The Company adoption
of FIN No. 46 and FIN No. 46R did not have a significant impact on its
consolidated financial statements.
FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENTS - In conjunction with the Company
acquisition of certain assets of Airshield Corporation see Note 4, the Company
has established operations in Mexico. The functional currency for the Mexican
operations is the United States dollar. All foreign currency asset and liability
amounts are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange
rates. Income statement accounts are translated at the monthly average rates.
Gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign currency financial
statements into United States dollars and gains and losses resulting from
foreign currency transactions are included in current results of operations.
Aggregate foreign currency translation and transaction gains losses included
in operations totaled $119,930 in 2003 and $48,622 in 2002 and $9,598 in 2001.

NOTE PAYABLE - INTERNATIONAL
The Company paid the note payable due International Truck & Engine
Corporation in two payments. The first payment in the amount of $1,861,000
occurred in the first quarter of 2003, and a second payment of $17,859,000 was
made on December 30, 2003. For the second payment, the Company borrowed
$9,000,000 in the form of a note payable from its primary bank and used its cash
reserves. The remaining balance of the International note of $200,000 was
replaced by a new, 8% note due December 31, 2004. This note will be forgiven by
International if the Company meets certain earnings targets for the year ended
December 31, 2004.
Annual maturities of long-term debt are as follows          2004           $ 1,906,000
2005            1,736,000

Thereafter         5,805,000
Total           $14,905,000
LINE OF CREDIT
At December 31, 2003, the Company had available a $7,500,000 variable
rate bank revolving line of credit scheduled to mature on April 30, 2005. The
line of credit bears interest at LIBOR plus two percent or at the prime rate.
The line of credit is collateralized by all the Company assets. There was no
outstanding balance under this facility at any time during the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002.
INTEREST RATE SWAPS
In conjunction with its variable rate Industrial Revenue Bond, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which is designated as a
cash flow hedging instrument. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed
rate of 489% to the bank and receives 76% of the 30-day commercial paper rate.
The swap term and notional amount matches the payment schedule on the IRB with
final maturity in April 2013. The difference paid or received varies as
short-term interest rates change and is accrued and recognized as an adjustment
to interest expense. While the Company is exposed to credit loss on its interest
rate swap in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to the swap,
management believes such non-performance is unlikely to occur given the
financial resources of the counterparty. The effectiveness of the swap is
assessed at each financial reporting date by comparing the commercial paper rate
of the swap to the benchmark rate underlying the variable rate of the Industrial
Revenue Bond.
Effective January 1, 2004, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedge of the bank note
payable. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of 575% to the
bank and receives LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The swap term and notional amount
matches the payment schedule on the secured note payable with final maturity in
January 2011. While the Company is exposed to credit loss on its interest rate
swap in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to the swap, management
believes such non-performance is unlikely to occur given the financial resources
of the counterparty.
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, on
January 1, 2001. At January 1, 2001, The Company recorded the fair value of its
interest rate swap agreement of $159,000 as a long-term liability and $105,000
net of deferred income tax benefit of $54,000 to accumulated other
comprehensive income loss.
BANK COVENANTS
The Company is subject to formal debt covenants related to minimum
fixed charge coverage and total funded obligations debt ratios. As of December
31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

8. EQUITY
ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES
The Company Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain
provisions designed to discourage specific types of transactions involving an
actual or threatened change of control of the Company. These provisions, which
are designed to make it more difficult to change majority control of the Board
of Directors without its consent, include provisions related to removal of
Directors, the approval of a merger and certain other transactions as outlined
in the Certificate of Incorporation and any amendments to those provisions.
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER
The Company Certificate of Incorporation contains a provision the
Prohibited Transfer Provision designed to help assure the continued
availability of the Company substantial net operating loss and capital loss
carryforwards see Note 10 by seeking to prevent an ownership change as
defined under current Treasury Department income tax regulations. Under the
Prohibited Transfer Provision, if a stockholder transfers or agrees to transfer
stock, the transfer will be prohibited and void to the extent that it would
cause the transferee to hold a Prohibited Ownership Percentage as defined in
the Company Certificate of Incorporation, but generally, means direct and
indirect ownership of 45% or more of the Company common stock or if the
transfer would result in the transferee ownership increasing if the transferee
had held a Prohibited Ownership Percentage within the three prior years or if
the transferee ownership percentage already exceeds the Prohibited Ownership
Percentage under applicable Federal income tax rules. The Prohibited Transfer
Provision does not prevent transfers of stock between persons who do not hold a
Prohibited Ownership Percentage.

9. INCENTIVE STOCK PLANS
STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has a Long Term Equity Incentive Plan the Plan, as
originally approved by the shareholders in May 1997, and as amended in May 2000
to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance, that allows for grants
to directors and key employees of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock
options, director options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance shares, performance units and other incentive awards up to an
aggregate of 30 million awards, each representing a right to buy a share of the
Company common stock. The Plan expires on the earlier of December 31, 2006, or
the date the maximum number of available awards under the plan have been
granted.
During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company granted stock options under the
plan. The options have vesting schedules of five or nine and one-half years from
the date of grant, are not exercisable after ten years from the date of grant,
and were granted at prices which equaled or exceeded the fair market value of
the Company common stock at the date of grant.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2003, 2002
and 2001 was $2,18, $140 and $117, respectively. The fair value of the options
granted were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of
5%, no expected dividend yield, expected lives of 8 years and expected
volatility of 56%, 89% and 87% for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
On August 4, 2003, of the 1,171,500 stock options outstanding, 978,000

11. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company provides postretirement benefits to substantially all of
its United States employees. Costs associated with postretirement benefits
include pension expense, postretirement health care and life insurance expense
and expense related to contributions to two 401k defined contribution plans.
In addition, the Company also participates in a multi-employer defined benefit
plan for its United States union represented employees. All of the Company
United States union employees are covered under a multi-employer defined benefit
pension plan administered under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company
does not administer this plan and contributions are determined in accordance
with provisions in the negotiated labor contract.
Prior to the acquisition of Columbus Plastics from International,
certain of the Company employees were participants in various International
sponsored pension and postretirement plans. The International pension plan for
non-represented employees was non-contributory and both benefits and years of
service were frozen as of the date of the acquisition of Columbus Plastics. In
connection with the Acquisition, International retained responsibility for the
vested benefits as of December 31, 1996, and the Company agreed to reimburse
International for early retirement subsidies for certain employees. The
accumulated benefit obligation, which equals the projected benefit obligation
and net liability, is $233,000 at December 31, 2003 and $218,000 at December 31,
2002.
The postretirement health and life insurance plan provides healthcare
and life insurance for certain employees upon their retirement, along with their
spouses and certain dependents and requires cost sharing between the Company,
International and the participants in the form of premiums, co-payments and
deductibles. The Company and International share the cost of benefits for
certain employees, using a formula that allocates the cost based upon the
respective portion of time that the employee was an active service participant
after the acquisition of Columbus Plastics to the period of active service prior
to the acquisition of Columbus Plastics.
The funded status of the Company postretirement health and life
insurance benefits plan as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and reconciliation with
the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets are provided below                              POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS

16. RESTATEMENT
Subsequent to the issuance of the Company consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company determined that
inventory was overstated as a result of incorrect accounting entries in
connection with the results of physical inventory observations at the Company
Gaffney, South Carolina facility. Accordingly, the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2002 have been restated from amounts
previously reported.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Core Molding Technologies is committed to maintaining disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in its reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and are subject
to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment by individuals, the
difficulty to identify unlikely future events, and the difficulty to eliminate
misconduct completely. As a result, there can be no assurance that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors or fraud or ensure
that all material information will be made known to management in a timely
manner.
In January 2004, as part of the Company annual physical inventory
review, the Company learned of certain intentional inventory misstatements by a
former employee that occurred at the Gaffney, South Carolina facility. The Audit
Committee of the Company Board of Directors immediately began an investigation
into the inventory misstatements, with the assistance of a private investigation
firm and an independent forensic accounting firm.
The investigation confirmed that a concealment of inventory shortages
from 2002 through the third quarter 2003 existed and were limited to the actions
of a former employee at the Gaffney production facility. In the course of its
investigation, the Audit Committee further concluded that material weaknesses in
internal controls specifically relating to the completeness of accounting
policies and procedures and the segregation of duties of certain personnel with
respect to inventory reporting existed at the Gaffney facility.
The Company investigation determined and the private investigators
and the independent forensic accounting firm confirmed that it was an isolated
incident confined to its Gaffney facility. The investigation also confirmed
that the inventory misstatements masked material and labor inefficiencies
within the plant and that inventory misstatements did not affect any customer
deliveries.
In addition, the investigation determined that the then existing
analysis of monthly inventory trends was broad based and did not include
detailed analysis of scrap disposal as compared to scrap reported. Furthermore,
the investigation found inadequate focus by plant management on inventory
accuracy.
No significant changes in internal controls over financial reporting
were made during the quarter ended December 31, 2003. However, since January 15,
2004, the Company has taken measures to improve the effectiveness of internal
controls and believes these efforts address the matters described above. Certain
measures taken through March 30, 2004 include, but are not limited to, the
following     -    Personnel changes at the Gaffney, South Carolina facility,
including an interim plant manager, a new production manager,
plant accountant, and materials manager.
-    Increased monthly analysis of inventory balances and inventory
transactions including scrap analysis and reconciliations,
inventory turns analysis by inventory classification and
additional interim physical inventory analyses, and approval
of manual adjustments to inventory records.
-    Continued emphasis by the Company senior management that
overriding of internal controls will not be tolerated; and
-    The establishment of a whistle blower hotline to allow
employees to anonymously report improper conduct.
As required by Rule 13a-15b of the Exchange Act, the Company has carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its
management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures. The evaluation examined those disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2003, the end of the period covered by this
report. Based upon the evaluation, the Company management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of
December 31, 2003, the Company disclosure controls and procedures were
effective, except as described above, to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was
accumulated and communicated to the Company management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.                                        39                   PART III
