NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. A, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries
collectively, A and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are referred to as
Abercrombie & Fitch or the Company, is a specialty retailer of high
quality, casual apparel for men, women and kids with an active, youthful
lifestyle. The business was established in 1892.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the historical
financial statements of, and transactions applicable to, A and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries and reflect the assets, liabilities, results of
operations and cash flows on a historical cost basis.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of A and its
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
FISCAL YEAR
The Company fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31.
Fiscal years are designated in the financial statements and notes by the
calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The results for fiscal
years 2004, 2003 and 2002 represent the fifty-two week periods ended
January 29, 2005, January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003, respectively.
CASH AND EQUIVALENTS
Cash and equivalents include amounts on deposit with financial
institutions and investments with original maturities of less than 90
days. Outstanding checks at year end are reclassified in the balance sheet
from cash to accounts payable to be reflected as liabilities. At fiscal
year end 2004 and 2003, the outstanding checks reclassified were $536
million and $332 million, respectively.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
All investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days are
accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities. The Company determines the appropriate
classification at the time of purchase. At January 29, 2005, the Company
had no investments in marketable securities and at January 31, 2004 had
$4647 million of investments in marketable securities. The marketable
securities consisted of auction rate securities classified as
available-for-sale. Investments in these securities are recorded at cost,
which approximates fair value due to their variable interest rates, which
reset every 7 to 49 days. Despite the long-term nature of their stated
contractual maturities, there is a readily liquid market for these
securities. As a result, there are no cumulative gross unrealized holding
gains losses or gross realized gains losses from marketable
securities. All income generated from these marketable securities was
recorded as interest income.
49    INVENTORIES
Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market,
on a first-in-first-out basis, utilizing the retail method. An initial
markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a
cost-to-retail ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the
retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the
already established cost-to-retail relationship.
The fiscal year is comprised of two principal selling seasons: Spring the
first and second quarters and Fall the third and fourth quarters. The
Company further reduces inventory at season end by recording an additional
markdown reserve using the retail carrying value of inventory from the
season just passed. Markdowns on this carryover inventory represent
estimated future anticipated selling price declines. Additionally,
inventory valuation at the end of the first and third quarters reflects
adjustments for inventory markdowns for the total season. Further, as part
of inventory valuation, inventory shrinkage estimates are made, based on
historical trends, that reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen
items.
The markdown reserve was $66 million and $55 million at January 29, 2005
and January 31, 2004, respectively. The shrink reserve was $29 million
and $33 million at January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively.
STORE SUPPLIES
The initial inventory of supplies for new stores including, but not
limited to, hangers, signage, security tags and point-of-sale supplies are
capitalized at the store opening date. Subsequent shipments are expensed
except for new merchandise presentation programs, which are capitalized.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for
financial reporting purposes on a straight-line basis, using service lives
ranging principally from 30 years for buildings, the lesser of 10 years or
the life of the lease for leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for
other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds represent the present
value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of existing
stores as of the 1988 purchase of the Abercrombie & Fitch business by The
Limited, Inc. now known as Limited Brands, Inc., The Limited and are
being amortized over the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets
sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization
are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in
net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized.
Long-lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for
impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in
question. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to,
management plans for future operations, recent operating results and
projected cash flows. The Company incurred impairment charges of $12
million and $13 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2002, respectively.
There were no impairment charges taken in fiscal 2003.
50    INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109 SFAS 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based
on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to reverse. Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
CONTINGENCIES
In the normal course of business, the Company must make continuing
estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities, which
requires the use of management judgment on the outcome of various
issues. Management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the
estimating process. However, the ultimate outcome of various legal issues
could be different than management estimates, and adjustments may be
required.
SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
At January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, there were 150 million shares of
$01 par value Class A Common Stock authorized, of which 860 million and
946 million shares were outstanding at January 29, 2005 and January 31,
2004, respectively, and 1064 million shares of $01 par value Class B
Common Stock authorized, none of which were outstanding at January 29,
2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively. In addition, 15 million shares of
$01 par value Preferred Stock were authorized, none of which have been
issued. See Note 13 for information about Preferred Stock Purchase Rights.
Holders of Class A Common Stock generally have identical rights to holders
of Class B Common Stock, except that holders of Class A Common Stock are
entitled to one vote per share while holders of Class B Common Stock are
entitled to three votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of
shareholders.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes
possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with
either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e-commerce sales are recorded
upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and
handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as
revenue and the related direct shipping costs are classified as cost of
goods sold. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue.
The Company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on
historical experience and various other assumptions that management
believes to be reasonable. The Company accounts for gift cards by
recognizing a liability at the time when a gift card is sold. Revenue is
recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. The Company
reviews its gift card liability at least annually and adjusts the
liability based on historical redemption patterns as required.
51    COST OF GOODS SOLD, OCCUPANCY AND BUYING COSTS
The following expenses are included as part of Cost of Goods Sold,
Occupancy and Buying Costs: landed cost of merchandise, freight, payroll
and related costs associated with merchandise, design, procurement,
inspection, store rents and other real estate costs, store asset
depreciation, inventory shrink and markdowns, and catalogue production and
mailing costs.
GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES
General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses include distribution
center costs including receiving and warehouse costs, store payroll and
expenses, home office payroll and expenses not related to merchandise
procurement and advertising.
CATALOGUE AND ADVERTISING COSTS
Costs related to the catalogue, primarily consist of catalogue production
and mailing costs and are expensed as incurred as a component of Cost of
Goods Sold, Occupancy and Buying Costs. Advertising costs consist of
in-store photographs and advertising in selected national publications and
billboards and are expensed as part of General, Administrative and Store
Operating Expenses when the photographs or publications first appear.
Catalogue and advertising costs, which include photo shoot costs, amounted
to $338 million in 2004, $336 million in 2003 and $334 million in 2002.
OPERATING LEASES
The Company leases property for its stores under operating leases. Most
lease agreements contain construction allowances, rent escalation clauses
and/or contingent rent provisions.
For construction allowances, the Company records a deferred lease credit
on the consolidated balance sheet and amortizes the deferred lease credit
as a reduction to rent expense on the consolidated statement of income
over the terms of the leases. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during
the lease term, the Company records minimum rental expense on a
straight-line basis over the terms of the lease on the consolidated
statement of income. The term of the lease over which the Company
amortizes construction allowances and minimum rental expenses on a
straight-line basis begins on the date of initial possession, which is
generally when the Company enters the space and begins to make
improvements in preparation of intended use.
Certain leases provide for contingent rents, which are determined as a
percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels. The Company
records a contingent rent liability in accrued expenses on the
consolidated balance sheet and the corresponding rent expense when
management determines that achieving the specified levels during the
fiscal year is probable.
52    STORE PREOPENING EXPENSES
Pre-opening expenses related to new store openings are charged to
operations as incurred.
DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Costs to design and develop the Company merchandise are expensed as
incurred and are reflected as a component of Cost of Goods Sold,
Occupancy and Buying Costs.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The recorded values of current assets and current liabilities, including
receivables, marketable securities and accounts payable, approximate fair
value due to the short maturity and because the average interest rate
approximates current market origination rates.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company reports stock-based compensation through the disclosure-only
requirements of SFAS No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an Amendment of FASB No. 123,
but elects to measure compensation expense using the intrinsic value
method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly, no compensation
expense for options has been recognized as all options are granted at fair
market value at the grant date. The Company does recognize compensation
expense related to restricted share awards. If compensation expense
related to options had been determined based on the estimated fair value
of options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002, consistent with the methodology
in SFAS 123, the pro forma effect on net income and net income per basic
and diluted share would have been as follows    Thousands except per share amounts                                      2004        2003        2002

share awards actually recognized in earnings in each period presented
using the intrinsic value method.
The average weighted-average fair values of options were $1505, $1418
and $1207 for the 2004, 2003 and 2002 fiscal years, respectively. The
fair value of each option was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, which are included in the pro forma results above.
For purposes of the valuation, the following weighted-average assumptions
were used: a 128% dividend yield in the 2004 fiscal year and no expected
dividends in the 2003 and 2002 fiscal years; average price volatility of
56%, 63% and 53% in the 2004, 2003 and 2002 fiscal years, respectively;
average risk-free interest rates of 32%, 30% and 43% in the 2004, 2003
and 2002 fiscal years, respectively; assumed average forfeiture rates of
28%, 23% and 15% for the 2004, 2003 and 2002 fiscal years; and vesting
lives of 4 years in the 2004, 2003 and 2002 fiscal years.
For options granted to non-associates directors during 2004, the average
weighted-average fair value of the options was $522. The fair value of
each option was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model,
which are included in the pro forma results above. For purposes of the
valuation, the following weighted-average assumptions were used: a 128%
dividend yield; average price volatility of 37%; average risk-free
interest rate of 20; assumed average forfeiture rate of 12%; and vesting
life of 1 year.
54    EARNINGS PER SHARE
Net income per share is computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share. Net income per basic share is computed based on the
weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock. Net income
per diluted share includes the weighted-average effect of dilutive stock
options and restricted shares.

Common Stock were outstanding at year-end 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, but were not included in the computation of net income per
diluted share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of the underlying shares.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Since actual
results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates
and assumptions as new information becomes available.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year
presentation. The amounts reclassified did not have an effect on the
Company results of operations or shareholders' equity.
55 3.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement No. 123R SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, a revision of FASB
issued Statement No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. SFAS 123R requires an entity to recognize compensation expense in
an amount equal to the fair value of share-based payments granted to employees.
The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 will no longer be
an alternative to financial statement recognition. See Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net income and earnings per
share amounts for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004, as if the Company had used a
fair-value based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to
measure compensation expense for employee stock-based compensation awards. The
accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for reporting periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company is still in the process of determining the
impact on the results of operations and financial position upon the adoption of
SFAS 123R.

Under a tax sharing arrangement with The Limited, which owned 842% of the
outstanding Common Stock through May 19, 1998, the Company was responsible
for and paid to The Limited its proportionate share of income taxes
calculated upon its separate taxable income at the estimated annual
effective tax rate for periods prior to May 19, 1998. In 2002, a final tax
sharing payment was made to The Limited pursuant to an agreement to
terminate the tax sharing agreement. As a result, the Company has been
indemnified by The Limited for any federal, state or local taxes asserted
with respect to The Limited for all periods prior to May 19, 1998. Amounts
paid to The Limited totaled $14 million in 2002.
Amounts paid directly to taxing authorities were $1140 million, $1130
million and $823 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

management believes that it is more likely than not that the full amount
of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.

A total of 507,500, 78,000 and 1,046,000 restricted shares were granted in
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, with a total market value at
grant date of $160 million, $21 million and $280 million, respectively.
Of the restricted shares granted in 2002, 1,000,000 shares were awarded to
the Company Chairman, which become vested on December 31, 2008 provided
the Chairman remains continuously employed by the Company through such
date. The remaining restricted share grants either vest on a graduated
scale over four years for associates or over one year for the
non-associate directors. The market value of restricted shares is being
amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period, which excluding
the above mentioned grants to the Chairman and the non-associate directors
is generally four years. Compensation expenses related to restricted share
awards amounted to $104 million, $53 million and $23 million in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.
11.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company maintains a qualified defined contribution retirement plan and
a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan. Participation in the
qualified plan is available to all associates who have completed 1,000 or
more hours of service with the Company during certain 12-month periods and
attained the age of 21. Participation in the nonqualified plan is subject
to service and compensation requirements. The Company contributions to
these plans are based on a percentage of associates' eligible annual
compensation. The cost of these plans was $91 million in 2004, $64
million in 2003 and $56 million in 2002.
Effective February 2, 2003, the Company established a Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan the SERP to provide additional retirement
income to its Chairman. Subject to service requirements, the Chairman will
receive a monthly benefit equal to 50% of his final average compensation
as defined in the SERP for life. The SERP has been actuarially valued by
an independent third party and the expense associated with the SERP is
being accrued over the stated term of the Amended and Restated Employment
Agreement, dated as of January 30, 2003, between the Company and its
Chairman.
61    Effective May 17, 2004, the Company established a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan the SERP to provide additional retirement income to
its President and Chief Operating Officer. Subject to service
requirements, upon retirement at age 57 the President and Chief Operating
Officer would receive a monthly annuity of $8,33333 for life. The monthly
amount would be actuarially increased for retirement after age 57, or
reduced 20% per year for retirement prior to age 57. The SERP has been
actuarially valued by an independent third party and the expense
associated with the SERP is being accrued over the stated term of the
Employment Agreement, dated as of May 17, 2004, between the Company and
its President and Chief Operating Officer.
12.  CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings that arise out
of, and are incidental to, the conduct of its business.
In 2003, five actions were filed in different state courts under various
states' laws on behalf of purported classes of employees and former
employees of the Company alleging that the Company required its associates
to wear and pay for a uniform in violation of applicable law. In each
case, the plaintiff, on behalf of his or her purported class, sought
injunctive relief and unspecified amounts of economic and liquidated
damages. Two of the actions were ordered coordinated in November of 2003
and on February 28, 2005, were settled and dismissed with prejudice as to
the individual claims and without prejudice as to the putative class
claims. Two other cases were stayed in the state court proceedings and the
plaintiffs in those cases joined in the action in federal court described
in the immediately following paragraph. In connection with the settlement
of that federal court action, the two related state court cases were
dismissed with prejudice. The Company has filed an answer in the remaining
state court action. The plaintiffs in that action filed, and the Company
opposed, a motion to certify a class of employees in the State of
Washington. The Court granted the plaintiffs' motion and the Company has
commenced a discretionary appeal thereof.
In 2003, an action was filed in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania, in which the plaintiff alleged that the
uniform, when purchased, drove associates' wages below the federal
minimum wage. The complaint purported to state a collective action on
behalf of part-time associates under the Fair Labor Standards Act. On
November 17, 2004, the Court gave final approval of the settlement of this
case and the two state court cases whose plaintiffs had joined in the
federal court action, and dismissal of the case with prejudice was
entered. The settlement is not material to the consolidated financial
statements of the Company.
As previously mentioned, five of the above-described cases have been
settled. The Company does not believe it is feasible to predict the
outcome of the remaining state court legal proceeding described above and
intends to vigorously defend against it. The timing of the final
resolution of that proceeding is also uncertain. Accordingly, the Company
cannot estimate a range of potential loss, if any, for that legal
proceeding.
In each of 2004, 2003 and 2002, one action was filed against the Company
involving overtime compensation. In each action, the plaintiffs, on behalf
of their respective purported class, seek injunctive relief and
unspecified amounts of economic and liquidated damages. In the action
which was filed in state court under California law in 2002, the parties
are in the process of discovery, and the trial court has ordered a class
of store managers in California certified for limited purposes. In the
action which was filed in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio in 2003, the Company has filed a motion to
dismiss which was denied as to certain of the plaintiffs and remains
pending as to certain claims of a third plaintiff. The parties in this
action have commenced discovery.                    62
In the remaining case, which was filed on December 28, 2004 in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, the Company
has filed an answer. The Company does not believe it is feasible to
predict the outcome of the legal proceedings described in this paragraph
and intends to defend vigorously against them. The timing of the final
resolution of each of these proceedings is also uncertain. Accordingly,
the Company cannot estimate a range of potential loss, if any, for any of
these legal proceedings.
In 2003, an action was filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California on behalf of a purported class alleged to
be discriminated against in hiring or employment decisions due to race
and/or national origin. The plaintiffs in this action sought, on behalf of
their purported class, injunctive relief and unspecified amounts of
economic, compensatory and punitive damages. Two other purported class
action employment discrimination lawsuits were subsequently filed in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California, both
on November 8, 2004. One alleged gender female discrimination in hiring
or employment decisions and sought, on behalf of the purported class,
injunctive relief and unspecified amounts of economic, compensatory and
punitive damages. The other was brought by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission the EEOC alleging race, ethnicity and gender
female discrimination in hiring or employment decisions. The EEOC
complaint sought injunctive relief and, on behalf of the purported class,
unspecified amounts of economic, compensatory and punitive damages. On
November 8, 2004, the Company signed a consent decree settling these three
related class action discrimination lawsuits, subject to judicial review
and approval. The monetary terms of the consent decree provided that the
Company would set aside $400 million to pay to the class, approximately
$75 million for attorneys' fees, and approximately $25 million for
monitoring and administrative costs to carry out the settlement. As a
result, the Company accrued a non-recurring charge of $329 million, which
was included in general, administrative and store operating expenses for
the third quarter of fiscal 2004. This was in addition to amounts accrued
during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 when the Company recorded an $80
million charge net of expected proceeds of $10 million from insurance
resulting from an increase in expected defense costs related to the case
filed in 2003. The preliminary approval order was signed by Judge Susan
Illston of the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California on November 16, 2004, and that order scheduled a final fairness
and approval hearing for April 14, 2005.
The Company accrues amounts related to legal matters if reasonably
estimable and reviews these amounts at least quarterly.

64 14.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In February 2005, two substantially similar actions were filed in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by A stockholders challenging
the compensation received by A Chief Executive Officer, Michael S.
Jeffries. The complaints allege, among other things, that the Board of
Directors of A and the members of the Compensation Committee of the
Board breached their fiduciary duties in granting stock options and an
increase in cash compensation to Mr. Jeffries in February 2002 and in
approving Mr. Jeffries current employment agreement in January 2003 the
Amended and Restated Employment Agreement. The complaints further
assert that A disclosures with respect to Mr. Jeffries' compensation
were deficient. The complaints seek, among other things, to rescind the
purportedly wrongful compensation and to set aside the current employment
agreement. The actions have been consolidated under the caption, In re
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. Shareholder Derivative Litigation., C.A. No. 1077
the Litigation. A has formed a special committee of independent
directors the Special Committee to determine what action to take with
respect to the Litigation. A and the defendant members of the Board of
Directors have denied, and continue to deny, any liability or wrongdoing
with respect to all claims alleged in the Litigation. Nevertheless, the
Special Committee, A and the other defendants have determined that it is
desirable to settle the Litigation and thereby eliminate the substantial
burden, expense, inconvenience and distraction that the Litigation would
entail and to dispel any uncertainty that may exist as a result of the
Litigation.
Pursuant to a stipulation of settlement dated April 8, 2005, and subject
to the approval of the Court, the parties have agreed to settle the
Litigation on the following terms: i Mr. Jeffries Amended and
Restated Employment Agreement will be amended to reduce his stay bonus
from twelve million dollars to six million dollars and to condition
receipt of the stay bonus on A achieving defined performance criteria
except in certain circumstances, ii Mr. Jeffries will not receive any
award of stock options during calendar years 2005 and 2006 and in
subsequent years will receive stock options only in the discretion of the
Compensation Committee, iii Mr. Jeffries will hold the Career Shares
awarded under Section 4b of his Amended and Restated Employment
Agreement for a period of one year after he ceases to be an executive
officer of A the Holding Period, and iv Mr. Jeffries will hold one
half of the A shares received from the first one million stock options
exercised following this settlement, net of shares equal to the amount of
withholding taxes and exercise price, until the expiration of the Holding
Period. Also as part of the settlement, the Special Committee has agreed
to recommend to the full Board that the Board cause A to take, subject
to the directors' fiduciary duties, and A has agreed to use its best
efforts to take, each of the following actions, with the actions described
in clauses i through iv to be achieved not later than the one year
anniversary of the settlement becoming final: i A shall conduct a
full review of its corporate governance practices and procedures, ii at
least a majority of the members of the Compensation Committee shall be
directors who were not members of the Compensation Committee at the time
of the events giving rise to the Litigation and who have no substantial
business or professional relationship with A other than their status as
directors, iii the Compensation Committee shall retain independent
counsel and an independent compensation expert, iv A shall adopt FAS
123 providing for the expensing of stock option compensation, v for a
period of five years A shall not nominate for election to the Board any
director who does not meet the New York Stock Exchange standards for
director independence provided, however, this provision shall not apply
to any current member of the Board or to up to three members of A
senior management, vi one member of the Board who does not meet such
standards shall not be nominated for re-election in connection with the
2005 annual meeting, and vii the Company shall review the disclosures to
appear in A proxy statement for its 2005 Annual Meeting relating to
executive compensation and will provide plaintiffs' counsel with an
opportunity to comment on the disclosures. The stipulation of settlement
provides for a release of all claims that A has or may have against any
of the defendants relating to the matters and claims that were or could
have been raised in the Litigation. The plaintiffs will apply to the
Court for an award of attorneys' fees.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Abercrombie & Fitch Co. We have completed an integrated audit of Abercrombie & Fitch Co. fiscal 2004
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of January 29, 2005 and audits of its fiscal 2003 and 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. the Company and its subsidiaries at January 29, 2005
and January 31, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended January 29, 2005 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, we have audited management assessment, included in Management Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January 29, 2005, because the Company controls over
the selection and application of its lease accounting policies related to
construction allowances and the recording of rent between the date the Company
takes possession of the property and the commencement date of the lease were
ineffective based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of
internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions.
67 A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected. The following material weakness has been identified and included
in management assessment. As of January 29, 2005, the Company controls over
the selection and application of its lease accounting policies related to
construction allowances and the recording of rent between the date the Company
takes possession of the property and the commencement date of the lease were
ineffective to ensure that such leasing transactions were recorded in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Specifically, because of the
deficiency in the Company controls over the selection and application of its
lease accounting policies, the Company failed to properly classify and account
for property and equipment, deferred lease credits from landlords, rent expense,
depreciation expense and the related impact of these items on cash provided by
operating activities and cash used for investing activities in the consolidated
statements of cash flows, which resulted in restatements of the Company 2003,
2002 and 2001 annual financial statements and 2004 and 2003 interim consolidated
financial statements. Additionally, if the control deficiency is not remediated
it could result in a misstatement of the aforementioned financial statement
accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to annual
or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
Accordingly, management of the Company has concluded that this control
deficiency constitutes a material weakness. This material weakness was
considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied
in our audit of the fiscal 2004 consolidated financial statements, and our
opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company internal control over
financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.
In our opinion, management assessment that Abercrombie & Fitch Co. did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29,
2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Also, in our
opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
January 29, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers

Not applicable.
Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules
13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
the Company management, including the Chairman and Chief Executive and the
Senior Vice President - Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required financial disclosures. Because of inherent
limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.
The Company management, with the participation of the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President - Chief Financial Officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of January 29, 2005. The
evaluation included consideration of facts and circumstances surrounding
corrections of the Company lease accounting practices. These corrections
resulted in the restatement of the Company 2003, 2002 and 2001 annual
financial statements and 2004 and 2003 interim consolidated financial
statements. As a result of the restatements and the related material weakness
discussed under Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of January 29, 2005, the Company disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective at a reasonable level of assurance.
Notwithstanding this material weakness, the Company management has concluded
that the consolidated financial statements included in this report present
fairly, in all material respects, the Company financial position and results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company internal
control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f
under the Exchange Act, is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company internal control over
financial reporting as of January 29, 2005 using criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
69 A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected. As of January 29, 2005, the Company controls over the selection
and application of its lease accounting policies related to construction
allowances and the recording of rent between the date the Company takes
possession of the property and the commencement date of the lease were
ineffective to ensure that such leasing transactions were recorded in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Specifically, because of the
deficiency in the Company controls over the selection and application of its
lease accounting policies, the Company failed to properly classify and account
for property and equipment, deferred lease credits from landlords, rent expense,
depreciation expense and the related impact of these items on cash provided by
operating activities and cash used for investing activities in the consolidated
statements of cash flows, which resulted in restatements of the Company 2003,
2002 and 2001 annual financial statements and 2004 and 2003 interim consolidated
financial statements. Additionally, if the control deficiency is not remediated
it could result in a misstatement of the aforementioned financial statement
accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to annual
or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
Accordingly, management of the Company has concluded that this control
deficiency constitutes a material weakness and that internal control over
financial reporting was not effective as of January 29, 2005 based on the
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
COSO.
The Company independent registered public accounting firm,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited management assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of
January 29, 2005 as stated in their report, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended January 29, 2005, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company internal control over financial reporting.
In the first quarter of 2005, the Company remediated the material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting by correcting its method of accounting
for construction allowances and recording of rent between the date the Company
takes possession of the property and the commencement date of the lease. The
Company implemented controls to ensure that all leases are reviewed and
accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No13, Accounting for Leases and Financial Accounting Standards Board
Technical Bulletin No. 88-1, Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases; and
Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin No. 85-3, Accounting
for Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent Increases.
