34 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. the
Company as of December30, 2001 and
December29, 2002, and the related consolidated statements
of income, common stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December29,
2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of P.F. Changs China
Bistro, Inc. at December30, 2001 and December29,
2002 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December29,
2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated
financial statements, in 2002 the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill.

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial

STATEMENTS December29, 2002 1.Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies Organization
and Nature of Operations P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. the
Company operates two restaurant concepts consisting
of restaurants throughout the United States under the name of
P.F. Changs China Bistro and Pei Wei
Asian Diner. The Company was formed in 1996 and became
publicly traded in 1998. Fiscal
Year The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday
closest to the end of December and included 52weeks in
2000, 2001 and 2002. Use of
Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principles of
Consolidation The Companys consolidated financial
statements include the accounts and operations of the Company
and its subsidiaries and partnerships in which it owns more than
a 50percent interest. All material balances and
transactions between the consolidated entities have been
eliminated. Minority interest is recorded as a reduction of the
reported income or expense unless the amount would result in a
reduction of expense for which the minority partner would not be
responsible. Cash and Cash
Equivalents The Companys cash and cash equivalent
balances are not pledged or restricted. The Companys
policy is to invest cash in excess of operating requirements in
income-producing investments. Income-producing investments with
maturities of three months or less at the time of investment are
reflected as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents at
December29, 2002 consist primarily of money market funds. Investments The Company accounts for investments in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standard No115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. The Companys investments are classified
as available for sale, and have been recorded at fair value
which approximates cost. At December29, 2002 and
December30, 2001, $38million and $133million
respectively was recorded as Short-term investments, consisted
of preferred stock investments in Dividends Received Eligible
Auction Market Stock DREAMSoffered under private
placements by a subsidiary of Bank of America. Under the terms
of the investment arrangement, the Company participates in
periodic auctions that are generally held every 49days and
that determine the dividend rate. The Company has the
opportunity to offer to sell its investment during such periodic
auctions subject to availability of buying bidders. The Company
may also sell the investment to certain accredited investors.
Under the prospectus it is the intention of the issuer to
maintain a rating for the DREAMS at a grade of Aa3 by
Moodys. 40 Table of Contents Receivables Receivables, which we classified in Prepaid
and other current assets, consist primarily of amounts due
from landlords or other parties for the reimbursement of
leasehold improvements paid by the Company.   
Inventories Inventories consist of food and beverages and are
stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in,
first-out method.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, which
includes capitalized interest during the construction and
development period. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
service lives of the related assets, which approximates seven
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
the useful life of the asset or the length of the related lease
term. China and smallwares are depreciated over two years up to
50percent of their original cost, and subsequent additions
are expensed as purchased. During the years ended
December31, 2000 and December30, 2001, the Company
capitalized $533,000 and $77,000, respectively, of interest
costs. The Company follows Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets
used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and
the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the assets carrying amount. The
Companys policy is to evaluate long-lived assets for
impairment at the restaurant level.   
Goodwill In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No141 SFAS
No141, Business Combinations, and No142
SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer
be amortized, but will be subject to annual impairment tests in
accordance with the statements. Other intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives. P.F. Changs adopted the standard effective
January1, 2002. The standard affects the treatment of
goodwill acquired in the purchase of interests in various
restaurants at the formation of the Company. In accordance with
SFAS No142, P.F. Changs ceased amortization on
$68million of goodwill existing as of that date. Had the
standard been in effect for the year ended December30,
2001, net income would have increased by $280,000, resulting in
no impact in basic net income per share and a one cent increase
in diluted net income per share. P.F. Changs is required
to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis at a
minimum and more frequently under certain circumstances.
Impairment tests are performed with respect to goodwill at the
segment level of reporting. As of December29, 2002, no
impairment of goodwill has been recognized. There can be no
assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result
in a charge to earnings.   
Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of the excess of fair
market value over cost as a result of the acquisition of certain
minority partnership interests in the operating rights of
certain of P.F. Changs partnerships and/or operating
restaurants. Intangible assets are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally
fifteen years. Amortization expense of intangible assets totaled
$64,000 and $411,000 for the years ended December30, 2001
and December29, 2002. Estimated amortization expense for
each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows:
20032007, $420,000 for each year. Impairment
tests are performed with respect to these intangible assets at
the reporting level of the interests acquired, generally at the
partnership or restaurant level. 41 Table of Contents   
Accrued Insurance The Company is self-insured for certain
exposures, principally general liability and workers
compensation including customer claims for the first $100,000
or $250,000 of individual claims, depending on the type of
claim. The Company has paid amounts to its carrier that are in
excess of the claims known to date and has provided additional
accrued liabilities for its estimate of ultimate claims. In
developing these estimates, the Company uses historical
experience factors to estimate the ultimate claim exposure.
Given the estimation nature of this area, and the number of
known and yet to be determined claims, it is reasonably possible
that future adjustments to these estimates will be required.
Based upon the information known at December29, 2002,
management believes it has provided adequate reserves for its
self-insured exposure.   
Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue represents gift certificates
sold for which revenue recognition criteria, generally
redemption, has not been met.   
Revenue Recognition Revenues from food, beverage and alcohol sales
are recognized as products are sold.   
Advertising The Company expenses advertising as incurred.
Advertising expense for the years ended December31, 2000,
December30, 2001 and December29, 2002 was
approximately $2,442,000, $2,304,000 and $2,464,000 respectively.   
Preopening Expense Preopening expenses, consisting primarily of
manager salaries and relocation expense, employee payroll and
related training costs incurred prior to the opening of a
restaurant, are expensed as incurred.   
Income Taxes The Company utilizes the liability method of
accounting for income taxes as set forth in SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the liability
method, deferred taxes are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse. Recognition of
deferred tax assets is limited to amounts considered by
management to be more likely than not of realization in future
periods. Minority interests relating to the income or loss
of consolidated partnerships includes no provision for income
taxes as any tax liability related thereto is the responsibility
of the individual minority investors.   
Stock-Based Compensation The Company grants stock options for a fixed
number of shares to certain employees and directors with an
exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the
shares at the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock
option grants in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB No25 and related
Interpretations, and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation
expense for the stock option grants. The following table represents the effect on net
income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the
fair value based method and recognition provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting 42 Table of Contents Standards SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to

As required, the pro forma disclosures above
include options granted since January1, 1995.
Consequently, the effects of applying SFAS123 for
providing pro forma disclosures may not be representative of the
effects on reported net income for future years until all
options outstanding are included in the pro forma disclosures.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value
of stock-based compensation plans and other options is amortized
to expense primarily over the vesting period. See Note6
for further discussion of the Companys stock-based
employee compensation.   
Net Income Per Share Net income per share is computed in accordance
with SFAS No128, Earnings per Share. Basic
net income per share is computed based on the weighted average
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net
income per share is computed based on the weighted average
number of common shares and common stock equivalents, which
includes options outstanding under our stock option plans and
outstanding warrants. None of the Companys shares were
excluded from the net income per share computation due to their
anti-dilutive effect for the year ended December30, 2001.
For the year ended December29, 2002, there were 71,000 of
the Companys shares excluded from the calculation due to
their anti-dilutive effect. In addition to the potentially
dilutive shares of the Companys stock addressed above,
there is an additionally potentially dilutive effect of Pei Wei
stock options unexercised should the fair value of such stock
increase above the grant price and Pei Wei have a positive net
worth and profitability. For purposes of computing net income per share,
the number of common shares has been restated to reflect a stock
split effected in the form of a stock dividend of one share of
common stock for each share of common stock outstanding, paid on
May1, 2002 to stockholders of record as of April17,
2002. All references to the number of shares, per share amounts
and any other reference to the shares in the financial
statements and the accompanying notes, unless otherwise noted,
reflect the dividend on a retroactive basis. Previously awarded
stock options and other stock programs have been adjusted to
reflect the stock dividend. 43 Table of Contents   
Fair Value of Financial
Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents,
investments, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses
approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. The fair value of
long-term debt is determined using current applicable rates for
similar instruments and collateral as of the balance sheet date
and approximates the carrying value of such debt.   
Segment Reporting The Company accounts for its segments in
accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosure About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS
No131 requires that a public company report annual and
interim financial and descriptive information about its
reportable operating segments. Operating segments, as defined,
are components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by the
chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. Based on the
Companys methods of internal reporting and management
structure, P.F. Changs has two reportable segments, that
of the Bistro and that of Pei Wei.   
Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash investments and receivables. The Company
maintains cash and cash equivalents, funds on deposit and
certain other financial instruments with financial institutions
that are considered in the Companys investment strategy.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are
limited as the Companys receivables are primarily with its
landlords for the reimbursement of tenant improvements.   
Reclassifications Certain amounts shown in the prior periods
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current year consolidated financial statements
presentation.   
Recent Accounting
Pronouncements In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
SFAS No144, which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No121,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and
the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion
No30, Reporting the Results of Operations for
a disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS No144 was
effective for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2001, with earlier application encouraged. The Companys
adoption of SFAS No144 had no effect on the
Companys financial position or results of operation. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS
No146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF No94-3, Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to
Exit an Activity Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring. SFAS No146 eliminates the
provisions of EITF No94-3 that required a liability to be
recognized for certain exit or disposal activities at the date
an entity committed to an exit plan. SFAS No146 requires
a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal
activity to be recognized when the liability is incurred. SFAS
No146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that
are initiated after December31, 2002. The Company does not
expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact
on its results of operations or financial position. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure. SFAS No148 amends FASB Statement
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition
to SFAS No123s fair value method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. Statement 148 also amends the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No123 and APB Opinion
No28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require 44 Table of Contents disclosure in the summary of significant
accounting policies of the effects of an entitys
accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee
compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in
annual and interim financial statements. While SFAS No148
does not amend SFAS No123 to require companies to account
for employee stock options using the fair value method, the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No148 are applicable to all
companies with stock-based employee compensation, regardless of
whether they account for that compensation using the fair value
method of SFAS No123 or the intrinsic value method of APB
Opinion No25. As allowed by SFAS No123, the
Company has elected to continue to utilize the accounting method
prescribed by APB Opinion No25 and has adopted the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No123 as of
December29, 2002. 2.Property and

Facility In December of 2002, the Company entered into a
senior secured revolving credit facility with a commercial
lending institution. The credit facility allows for borrowings
up to $20million at an interest rate ranging from 125 to
200 basis points over the applicable London Interbank Offered
Rate LIBOR. At any time, but only one time, the Company has
the right to increase the credit facility up to the maximum
aggregate principal amount of $50million provided the
Company is in compliance with the terms of the facility. The
revolving credit facility expires on December20, 2005 and
contains certain restrictions and conditions which require the
Company to: maintain a certain minimum tangible net worth, an
adjusted leverage ratio at a maximum of 350:1, and a
minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio no less than 125:1.

Stock and Common Stockholders Equity Preferred
Stock The board of directors is authorized to issue up
to 10,000,000shares of preferred stock and to determine
the powers, preferences, privileges, rights, including voting
rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of those
shares without any further vote or act by the common
stockholders. There was no outstanding preferred stock as of
December30, 2001 and December29, 2002. In connection with the original capitalization of
the Company, a warrant to purchase 124,380shares of
preferred stock, convertible into 124,380shares of common
stock, was issued to an investment bank with an exercise price
of $200 per common share. This warrant was exercised in the
first quarter of 2001 in accordance with the cashless exercise
provision contained therein for an aggregate of
111,090shares of common stock. Common
Stock In January of 2001, the Company raised
$408million in cash through a private equity placement of
125million shares of common stock with two large mutual
fund companies. The Company used $15million of the
proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its credit
facility. In April 2002, the Company amended the Certificate of
Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of
common stock from 20million to 40million. Stock Option
Plans In August 1996, the Company adopted the 1996
Stock Option Plan 1996Plan, and in July 1997, the
Company adopted the 1997 Restaurant Management Stock Option Plan
1997Plan. Options under the 1996Plan may be
granted to employees, consultants and directors to purchase the
Companys common stock at an exercise price that equals or
exceeds the fair value of such shares on the date such option is
granted. Options under the 1997Plan may be granted to key
employees of the Company who are actively engaged in 46 Table of Contents the management and operation of the
Companys restaurants to purchase the Companys common
stock at an exercise price that equals or exceeds the fair value
of such shares on the date such option is granted. Vesting
periods are determined at the discretion of the board of
directors, and options currently outstanding at
December29, 2002 vest over five years. Options may be
exercised immediately upon grant, subject to a right by the
Company to repurchase any unvested shares at the exercise price.
Any options granted shall not be exercisable after ten years.
Upon certain changes in control of the Company, the 1996 and
1997 Plans provide for two additional years of immediate
vesting. The Company has reserved a total of
2,173,000shares of common stock for issuance under the
1996 and 1997 Plans, all of which have been granted as of
December29, 2002. During 1998, the Companys Board of
Directors approved the 1998 Stock Option Plan 1998 Plan which
provides for discretionary grants of incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options to the Companys employees,
including officers, directors, consultants, advisors, and other
independent contractors. A total of 2,213,770 additional shares
of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1998
Plan. The option price per share for an incentive stock option
may not be less than 100percent of the fair market value
of a share of common stock on the grant date. The option price
per share for a nonstatutory stock option may not be less than
85percent of the fair market value of a share of common
stock on the grant date. The Companys Compensation
Committee has the authority to, among other things, determine
the vesting schedule for each option granted. All options expire
within 10years. The 1998Plan includes an automatic
grant program for outside directors. Pursuant to this program,
each outside director will be granted an option to purchase
30,000shares of common stock at the time he or she is
first elected or appointed a director of the Company. In
addition, each outside director remaining in office will be
granted an option to purchase 15,000 immediately fully vested
shares on the day following each annual meeting of stockholders. During 1999, the Companys Board of
Directors approved the 1999 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan
1999Plan, which provides for discretionary grants of
nonqualified stock options to the Companys employees. The
1999Plan prohibits grants to officers or directors. A
total of 800,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance under the 1999Plan. The option price per share
may not be less than 85percent of the fair market value of
a share of common stock on the grant date. The Companys
Compensation Committee has the authority to, among other things,
determine the vesting schedule for each option granted. All
options expire within 10years. Pro forma information regarding net income and
net income per share, as disclosed in Note1, has been
determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee
stock-based compensation plans and other stock options under the
fair value method of SFASNo123. The fair value for
these options was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following

plans

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. Because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of its employee stock options. The weighted-average fair value
of options granted for the years ended December31, 2000,
December30, 2001 and December29, 2002 was $844 859 and $1460, respectively. 47 Table of Contents Information regarding activity for stock options

Since options are generally exercisable upon date
of grant, options exercisable, included in the above table,
represent vested options that are not subject to repurchase by
the Company. During 2001, PeiWei Asian Diner,
Inc.s Board of Directors approved the PeiWei Asian
Diner, Inc. 2001 Stock Option Plan 2001 PeiWei Plan,
which provides for discretionary grants of incentive stock
options and nonqualified stock options to employees, consultants
and directors of PeiWei Asian Diner, Inc. A total of 169
shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the
2001 PeiWei Plan. As of December29, 2002,
111options have been granted at prices ranging from $7,396
to $15,195 and 15 have been exercised at $7,396. The Company
holds 960 shares of common stock of PeiWei Asian Diner. 48 Table of Contents Employee
Stock Purchase Plan During 1998, the Companys Board of
Directors approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Purchase Plan and reserved 800,000 shares for issuance
thereunder. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to
purchase common stock at a discount, but only through payroll
deductions, during concurrent 24month offering periods.
Each offering period will be divided into four consecutive
6-month purchase periods. The price at which stock is purchased
under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85percent of the lower
of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of
the offering period and the fair market value of the common
stock on the last day of the purchase period. 7.Benefit
Plan Effective July1, 1997, the Company adopted
a 401k Defined Contribution Benefit Plan the Plan, which
covers substantially all employees of the Company that have
completed one year of service and have attained the age of
21years old. The Plan permits participants to contribute
to the Plan, subject to Internal Revenue Code restrictions, and
the plan also permits the Company to make discretionary matching
contributions. During the years ended December31, 2000,
December30, 2001 and December29, 2002, the Company
did not make any contributions to the Plan. 8.Employment
Agreements In August 2002, P.F. Changs executed
employment agreements with its Chief Executive Officer and also
its President; and the President of Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc.,
its majority owned subsidiary. The term for these agreements is
three years and the agreements prohibit these officers from
competing with P.F. Changs China Bistro and Pei Wei Asian
Diner in the area of Chinese and Asian food concepts during the
term of the agreements and for one year after termination. The agreements with the Chief Executive Officer
and the President of the Company also provide for immediate
vesting of unvested stock options, and the extension of the
expiration date to three years, after the occurrence of certain
events. These events include a change in control of the Company,
termination of the executives employment by the Company
without cause or separation of employment by the executive for
good reason as defined in the agreements. These
provisions in the employment agreements resulted in a
modification under FIN No44 to APB No25. Should
any of these events occur, the Company may be required to record
an expense based upon the difference between the original grant
price and the fair value at the modification date for the number
of shares ultimately affected by the modification. As of
December29, 2002, approximately 968,000shares were
affected by this agreement of which 250,000shares were
unvested. The agreement with the President of Pei Wei Asian
Diner, Inc. contains similar provisions with respect to a change
in control for Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc. and termination without
cause but also includes a provision whereby the Company could be
required to repurchase his shares of common stock in this
subsidiary at fair value should a termination without cause or
for good reason as defined in the agreement occur.
The agreement covers ten shares of Pei Wei Asian Diner, Inc.
common stock issued as of December29, 2002, and options to
purchase 46shares of which 40 were unvested as of
December29, 2002. 9.Partnership
Structure P.F. Changs utilizes a partnership
structure to facilitate the development, leadership and
operation of its restaurants. Each partner is required to make a
capital contribution in exchange for a specified interest in the
restaurant or region the partner is employed to manage. The
ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranges
between two and seven percent of the restaurant or region the
partner oversees. At the end of a specific term generally five
years, P.F. Changs has the right, but not the obligation,
to purchase the minority partners interest in the
partners respective restaurant or region at fair market
value. An estimated fair value is determined by reference to
current industry purchase metrics as well as the average cash
flows of the subject restaurants or regions
financial results. The Company has the option to pay the agreed
upon purchase price in cash or common stock of the company over
a period of time not to exceed five years. 49 Table of Contents As of December29, 2002, there were 120
partners within the P.F. Changs China Bistro, Inc. system.
During 2002, we purchased interests held by six of our minority
partners for a total of approximately $45million, of
which the majority was recorded as intangibles. Approximately
$15million of the total purchase price was paid in cash
while the remaining balance has been recorded as amounts due to
related parties on the balance sheet at December29, 2002.
These transactions were accretive to the Companys
financial results for the year ended December29, 2002 and
resulted in an additional $002 of diluted earnings per share.
In 2003, we will have the opportunity to purchase 11 additional
partnership interests. 10.Income

The FICA tip credit carryforward begins to expire
in 2021. For the year ended December31, 2000, the
valuation allowance increased by $1,516,000 as a result of
uncertainties with respect to the recoverability of credit
carryforwards. For the years ended December30, 2001 and
December29, 2002, the valuation decreased by $358,000 and
$1,158,000, respectively, as such credits were either utilized
or assessed as probable of utilization prior to their
expiration. This decision was based upon an analysis of the
Companys situation and plans. At December29, 2002, the Company took
advantage of additional tax deductions available relating to the
exercise of non-qualified stock options and disqualifying
dispositions of incentive stock options. Accordingly, for the
year ended December29, 2002, the Company recorded a
$117million increase to equity with a corresponding
$117million reduction to income tax liability. Quarterly
adjustments for the exercise of non-qualified stock options and
disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options may vary
as they relate to the actions of the option holder or
shareholder. 51 Table of Contents 11.Net Income

and Contingencies Operating Leases The Company leases restaurant and office
facilities and equipment and certain real property under
operating leases having terms expiring between 2003 and 2023.
The restaurant facility and real property leases primarily have
renewal clauses of five to 15years exercisable at the
option of the Company with rent escalation clauses stipulating
specific rent increases, some of which are based on the consumer
price index. Certain of these leases require the payment of
contingent rentals based on a percentage of gross revenues, as
defined. Rent expense for the years ended December31,
2000, December30, 2001 and December29, 2002 was
approximately $10,629,000, $14,249,000 and $18,055,000,
respectively. Contingent rent included in rent expense for the
years ended December31, 2000, December30, 2001 and
December29, 2002 was approximately $3,225,000, $4,246,000
and $5,348,000, respectively. At December29, 2002, the Company had
entered into other lease agreements for restaurant facilities
currently under construction or yet to be constructed. In
addition, the leases also contain provisions for additional
contingent rent based upon gross revenues, as defined in the
leases. Future minimum lease 52 Table of Contents payments under operating leases including

Financial Results Unaudited The following tables set forth certain unaudited
consolidated financial information for each of the four quarters
in fiscal 2001 and 2002. In managements opinion, this
unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same
basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and
includes all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments, that management considers necessary for a
fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read
in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial 53 Table of Contents Statements and Notes. The Company believes that
quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its financial results are not
necessarily indicative of future performance.
