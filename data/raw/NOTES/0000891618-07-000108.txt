54 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Yahoo! Inc.   We have completed integrated audits of Yahoo! Inc.s
Consolidated Financial Statements and of its internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.   Consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Yahoo! Inc. and its subsidiaries as
of December31, 2005 and 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2006 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January1, 2006, the Company changed
its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment.   Internal
control over financial reporting   Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance   
55 Table of Contents   with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP   SanJose, California   February23, 2007

Note1
The
Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   The Company.Yahoo! Inc., together with its
consolidated subsidiaries Yahoo! or the
Company, is a leading global Internet brand and one
of the most trafficked Internet destinations worldwide.
Yahoo!s mission is to connect people to their passions,
their communities, and the worlds knowledge.   Stock Split.On April7, 2004, the Yahoo!
Board of Directors approved a
two-for-one
split of the Companys shares of common stock effected in
the form of a stock dividend. As a result of the stock split,
Yahoo! stockholders received one additional share of Yahoo!
common stock for each share of common stock held of record on
April26, 2004. The additional shares of Yahoo! common
stock were distributed on May11, 2004. All share and per
share amounts in these consolidated financial statements and
related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the
stock split for all periods presented.   Basis of Presentation.The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Yahoo! and its
majority-owned or otherwise controlled subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Investments in entities in which the Company can
exercise significant influence, but does not own a majority
equity interest or otherwise control, are accounted for using
the equity method and are included as Investments in equity
interests on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has
included the results of operations of acquired companies from
the date of acquisition. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States requires management to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the
Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to
uncollectible receivables, the useful lives of long-lived assets
including property and equipment, investment fair values,
goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes and
contingencies. In addition, the Company uses assumptions when
employing the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate
the fair value of stock options granted for reporting and pro
forma disclosure purposes. The Company bases its estimates of
the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, when these
carrying values are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. In 2006, the
Company identified $25million of non-cash expenses, net of
tax, or $002per diluted share relating to 2004 and
earlier years, which were corrected in 2006. See
Note10 Income Taxes and
Note12Employee Benefits for
additional information.   Revenue Recognition.The Companys
revenues are derived principally from services, which comprise
marketing services for businesses and offerings to users. The
Company classifies these revenues as marketing services and fees.   The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance
with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
BulletinSAB No104 Revenue
Recognition, SAB104 and Financial
Accounting Standard Boards Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF Issue
No00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. In
all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or
determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
service is performed and collectibility of the resulting
receivable is reasonably assured. In accordance with EITF
No01-9,
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Product, the
Company accounts for cash consideration given to customers, for
which it does not receive a separately identifiable benefit or
cannot reasonably estimate fair value, as a reduction of revenue
rather than as an expense.   Marketing services revenue is generated from several offerings
including: the display of rich media advertisements, display of
text based links to an advertisers website, listing based
services and commerce based transactions.   
63 Table of Contents   Yahoo!
Inc.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   The Company recognizes revenue from the display of graphical
advertisements display advertising on the Yahoo!
Properties and on the websites of affiliates as
impressions are delivered. An
impression is delivered when an advertisement
appears in pages viewed by users. Arrangements for these
services generally have terms of up to three years and in the
majority of cases, the terms are less than one year or may be
terminated at any time by the advertiser. Some of these
advertising agreements may involve multiple element arrangements
arrangements with more than one deliverable.   The Company also recognizes revenue from the display of text
based links to the websites of its advertisers search
advertising which are placed on the Yahoo! Properties.
Search advertising revenue is recognized as
click-throughs occur. A click-through
occurs when a user clicks on an advertisers listing.   In addition to delivering search and display advertising on the
Yahoo! properties, the Company also generates revenue from
search
and/or
display advertising offerings on the websites of third party
entities which the Company refers to as affiliates
who have integrated the Companys offerings into their
websites. The Company pays affiliates for the revenue generated
from the display of these advertisements on the affiliates
websites. These payments are called traffic acquisition costs.
In accordance with EITF Issue
No99-19,
Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an
Agent, the revenue derived from these arrangements that
involve traffic supplied by affiliates is reported gross of the
payment to affiliates. This revenue is reported gross due to
the fact that the Company is the primary obligor to the
advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service.   Listings revenue is generated from a variety of consumer and
business listings-based services, including access to the Yahoo!
HotJobs database and classifieds such as Yahoo! Autos, Yahoo!
Real Estate and other services. The Company recognizes listings
revenue when the services are performed.   Transaction revenue is generated from facilitating commerce
based transactions through the Yahoo! Properties, principally
from Yahoo!s commerce properties including Yahoo! Travel
and Yahoo! Shopping. The Company recognizes transaction revenue
when there is evidence that qualifying transactions have
occurred, for example, when travel arrangements are booked
through Yahoo! Travel.   Fees revenue consists of revenues generated from a variety of
consumer and business fee-based services, including Internet
broadband services, premium mail, music and personals offerings
as well as services for small businesses. The Company
recognizes fees revenue when the services are performed.   Current deferred revenue primarily comprises contractual
billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received
in advance of revenue recognition. Long-term deferred revenue
includes amounts received from customers for which services will
not be delivered within the next 12months. Long-term
deferred revenue also includes amounts that arose on the
settlement of a litigation dispute. See Note14
Litigation Settlement for additional information.   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.The Company
records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its
assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical
experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the
credit quality of its customers, current economic conditions and
other factors that may affect customers ability to pay to
determine the level of allowance required.   Traffic Acquisition Costs.Traffic acquisition
costs consist of payments made to affiliates that have
integrated Yahoo!s search
and/or
display advertising offerings into their websites and payments
made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to
the Yahoo! Properties. The Company enters into agreements of
varying duration that involve these traffic acquisition costs.
There are generally three economic structures of the affiliate
agreements: fixed payments based on a guaranteed minimum amount
of traffic delivered, which often carry reciprocal performance
guarantees from the affiliate; variable payments based on a
percentage of the Companys revenue or based on a certain
metric, such as number of searches or paid clicks; or a
combination of the two. The Company expenses, as cost of
revenues, traffic acquisition costs associated with affiliate
arrangements under two different methods depending on the
structure of the agreement. Agreements with fixed payments are
expensed   
64 Table of Contents   Yahoo!
Inc.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   ratably over the term the fixed payment covers. Agreements
based on a percentage of revenue, number of paid introductions,
number of searches, or other metrics are expensed based on the
volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the
agreed-upon
price or rate.   Internal Use Software and Website Development
Costs.The Company capitalized certain internal
use software and website development costs totaling
approximately $19million, $18million, and
$84million during 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. The
estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each
specific project and ranges from one to three years. During
2004, 2005, and 2006, the amortization of capitalized costs
totaled approximately $11million, $18million, and
$14million, respectively. Capitalized internal use
software and website development costs are included in property
and equipment, net.   Product Development.Product development
expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses
including stock-based compensation expense incurred for the
development of, enhancements to and maintenance of the Yahoo!
Properties, classification and organization of listings within
Yahoo! Properties, research and development and Yahoo!s
technology platforms and infrastructure. Depreciation expense
and other operating costs are also included in product
development.   Advertising Costs.Advertising production
costs are recorded as expense the first time an advertisement
appears. Costs of communicating advertising are recorded as
expense as advertising space or airtime is used. All other
advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense
totaled approximately $160million, $201million, and
$222million for 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.   Stock-Based Compensation.Prior to
January1, 2006, the Company accounted for employee
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method
supplemented by pro forma disclosures in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB25 and
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS123, as amended by
SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure
an amendment of FASB Statement No123
SFAS148. Under the intrinsic value method,
the recorded stock-based compensation expense was related to the
amortization of the intrinsic value of Yahoo! stock options and
other stock-based awards issued by the Company and assumed in
connection with business combinations. Options granted with
exercise prices equal to the grant date fair value of the
Companys stock have no intrinsic value and therefore no
expense was recorded for these options under APB25. For
stock options whose exercise price was below the grant date fair
value of the Companys stock principally options assumed
in business combinations, the difference between the exercise
price and the grant date fair value of the Companys stock
was expensed over the service period generally the vesting
period using an accelerated amortization approach in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Interpretation No28, Accounting for Stock
Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award
Plans. Other stock-based awards for which stock-based
compensation expense was recorded were generally grants of
restricted stock awards which were measured at fair value on the
date of grant, based on the number of shares granted and the
quoted price of the Companys common stock. Such value was
recognized as an expense over the corresponding service period.   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted
SFAS123R using the modified prospective approach and
accordingly prior periods have not been restated to reflect the
impact of SFAS123R. Under SFAS123R, stock-based
awards granted prior to its adoption are expensed over the
remaining portion of their service period. These awards are
expensed under an accelerated amortization approach using the
same fair value measurements which were used in calculating pro
forma stock-based compensation expense under SFAS123. For
stock-based awards granted on or after January1, 2006, the
Company records stock-based compensation expense on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally
one to four years. SFAS123R required that the deferred
stock-based compensation on the consolidated balance sheet on
the date of adoption be netted against additional paid-in
capital. As of December31, 2005, there was a balance of
$235million of deferred stock-based compensation that was
netted against additional paid-in capital on January1,
2006.   
65 Table of Contents   Yahoo!
Inc.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   The Company has elected to use the with and without
approach as described in EITF Topic
No.D-32
in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized.
As a result, the Company will only recognize a tax benefit from
stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital if an
incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax
attributes currently available to the Company have been
utilized. In addition, the Company has elected to account for
the indirect effects of stock-based awards on other tax
attributes, such as the research tax credit, through the income
statement.   Operating Leases.The Company leases office
space and data centers under operating lease agreements with
original lease periods up to 23years. Certain of the
lease agreements contain rent holidays and rent escalation
provisions. Rent holidays and rent escalation provisions are
considered in determining straight-line rent expense to be
recorded over the lease term. The lease term begins on the date
of initial possession of the lease property for purposes of
recognizing lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term
of the lease. Lease renewal periods are considered on a
lease-by-lease
basis and are generally not included in the initial lease term.   Income Taxes.Deferred income taxes are
determined based on the differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. The
provision for income taxes comprises the Companys current
tax liability and change in deferred income tax assets and
liabilities. See Note10 Income
Taxes for additional information.   Comprehensive Income.Comprehensive income
consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive
income loss. Other comprehensive income loss refers to gains
and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles
are recorded as an element of stockholders equity but are
excluded from net income. The Companys other
comprehensive income loss is comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale,
as well as the Companys share of its equity investees
foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains
and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for
sale.   Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short and Long-Term
Investments.The Company invests its excess cash
in debt instruments of the United States Government and its
agencies and in high-quality corporate issuers which are
classified as marketable debt securities. All highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less
are considered cash equivalents. Investments with effective
maturities of less than 12months from the balance sheet
date are classified as current assets. Investments with
effective maturities greater than 12months from the
balance sheet date are classified as long-term assets.   The Companys marketable debt and equity securities are
classified as
available-for-sale
and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income loss. Realized gains or losses and declines in value
judged to be other than temporary, if any, on
available-for-sale
securities are reported in other income, net. The Company
evaluates the investments periodically for possible
other-than-temporary
impairment and reviews factors such as the length of time and
extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the
financial condition of the issuer and the Companys ability
and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may
be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. The
Company records impairment charges equal to the amount that the
carrying value of its
available-for-sale
securities exceeds the estimated fair market value of the
securities as of the evaluation date, if appropriate. The fair
value for securities is determined based on quoted market prices
as of the valuation date. In computing realized gains and
losses on
available-for-sale
securities, the Company determines cost based on amounts paid,
including direct costs such as commissions, to acquire the
security using the specific identification method. During the
years ended December31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, gross
realized gains and losses on
available-for-sale
debt securities were not material.   Concentration of Risk.Financial instruments
that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash
equivalents, marketable debt securities and accounts
receivable. As of December31, 2006, substantially all of
the Companys cash, cash equivalents and investments were
managed by six financial institutions. Accounts receivable are
typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from   
66 Table of Contents   Yahoo!
Inc.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit
losses. Historically, such losses have been within
managements expectations. As of December31, 2005
and 2006, no one customer accounted for 10percent or more
of the accounts receivable balance and no one customer accounted
for 10percent or more of the Companys revenues for
2004, 2005, or 2006.   Long-Lived Assets.   Property and Equipment.Buildings are stated
at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of 25years. Leasehold improvements
are amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life and
the remaining lease term. Computers and equipment and furniture
and fixtures are stated at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, generally two to five years. The Company recognized
depreciation expense on property and equipment of approximately
$165million, $224million, and $302million for
2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. The Company also
capitalized $14million of stock-based compensation expense
in the year ended December31, 2006.   Goodwill.Goodwill is carried at cost.
Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual test for
impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one
level below an operating segment and between annual tests in
certain circumstances. The performance of the test involves a
two-step process. The first step of the impairment test
involves comparing the fair value of the Companys
reporting units with the reporting units carrying amount,
including goodwill. The Company generally determines the fair
value of its reporting units using the expected present value of
future cash flows, giving consideration to the market valuation
approach. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds
the reporting units fair value, the Company performs the
second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the
amount of impairment loss, if any.   Intangible Assets Other than
Goodwill.Intangible assets other than goodwill
are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible
assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the
useful lives of the respective assets, generally two to seven
years. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible
assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of
recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future
cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual
disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss for long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that
management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the
carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.   Investments in Equity Interests.Investments
in entities in which the Company can exercise significant
influence but does not own a majority equity interest or
otherwise control, are accounted for using the equity method and
included as Investments in equity interests on the consolidated
balance sheets. The Company records its share of the results of
these companies one quarter in arrears within earnings in equity
interests on the consolidated statements of income. The Company
monitors its investments for
other-than-temporary
impairment by considering factors including the stock price of
public companies in which it has an equity investment as well as
current economic and market conditions and the operating
performance of the companies and records reductions in carrying
values when necessary. The fair value of privately held
investments is estimated using the best available information as
of the valuation date, including current earnings trends,
undiscounted cash flows, quoted stock prices of comparable
public companies, and other company specific information,
including recent financing rounds.   The carrying amounts of these investments are greater than the
underlying equity in net assets of these companies in certain
cases due in part to goodwill, which is not subject to
amortization in accordance with SFASNo142
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS142. This goodwill is evaluated for
impairment in accordance with APB Opinion No18, The
Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
Stock.   Foreign Currency.The functional currency of
the Companys international subsidiaries is generally the
local currency. The financial statements of these subsidiaries
are translated into United States dollars using period-end rates
of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates of
exchange for the period for revenues and expenses. Translation
gains losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income loss as a component of   
67 Table of Contents   Yahoo!
Inc.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   stockholders equity. The Company recorded foreign
currency transaction gains and losses, realized and unrealized
in other income, net on the consolidated statements of income,
of approximately $6million of net gains in 2004, net
losses of $8million in 2005, and net gains of
$5million in 2006.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FIN48, which clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income tax positions. This Interpretation
requires that the Company recognize in its financial statements
the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely
than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical
merits of the position. The provisions of FIN48 became
effective for the Company on January1, 2007, with the
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle, if any,
recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
FIN48 and its impact on its financial position, cash
flows, and results of operations.   In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC released SABNo108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements SAB108. SAB108
provides interpretive guidance on the SECs views on how
the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year
misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year
misstatement. The Company adopted SAB108 during the
fourth quarter of 2006. The adoption did not have a material
impact on the Companys financial position, cash flows, or
results of operations.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements SFAS157,
which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes
guidelines for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
regarding fair value measurements. SFAS157 does not
require any new fair value measurements and eliminates
inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting
pronouncements. SFAS157 will be effective for the Company
on January1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting SFAS157 but does not believe that the
adoption of SFAS157 will have a material impact on its
financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities SFAS159 which permits
entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value that are not currently
required to be measured at fair value. SFAS159 will be
effective for the Company on January1, 2008. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS159 on
its financial position, cash flows, and results of operations.   
Note2
Basic
and Diluted Net Income Per Share   Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
excluding any unvested restricted stock that is subject to
repurchase. Diluted net income per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive,
potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Potential common shares consist of unvested restricted stock and
restricted stock units, collectively referred to as
restricted stock awards using the treasury stock
method, the incremental common shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and
the conversion of the Companys zero coupon senior
convertible notes using the if-converted method. For 2004,
2005, and 2006, approximately 50million, 55million,
and 108million options to purchase common stock,
respectively, were excluded from the calculation, as the
exercise prices were greater than the average market price of
the common stock during the respective years. See
Note9 Long-Term Debt for

senior convertible notes.

completed the acquisition of 3721 Network Software Company
Limited 3721, a Hong Kong-based software
development company. The acquisition combined the
Companys global audience of users and 3721s keyword
search technology to enable the Company to continue improving
its global search services. These factors contributed to a
purchase price in excess of the fair value of net tangible and
intangible assets acquired from 3721 and as a result, the
Company recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction.   The total purchase price of approximately $95million
consisted of $92million in cash consideration,
$2million related to stock options exchanged and direct
transaction costs of $1million. The total cash
consideration of approximately $92million less cash
acquired of approximately $7million resulted in a net cash

completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Kelkoo S.A.
Kelkoo, a leading European online comparison
shopping service. In July 2004, the Company completed the
acquisition of additional interests in Kelkoo, increasing the
Companys total ownership interest in Kelkoo to
100percent. The acquisition expanded the Companys
global commerce presence and together with the Companys
existing services increased the Companys competitive
position in Europe. These factors contributed to a purchase
price in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible
assets acquired from Kelkoo and as a result, the Company
recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction.   The total purchase price of approximately $571million
consisted of $562million in cash consideration,
$6million in incurred liabilities and direct transaction

companies which were accounted for as business combinations.
The total estimated purchase price for these three acquisitions
was approximately $49million and consisted of
$46million in cash consideration, $2million related
to stock options exchanged, and $1million direct
transaction costs. The total cash consideration of
$46million less cash acquired of approximately
$2million resulted in a net cash outlay of
$44million. Of the purchase price, $41million was
allocated to goodwill, $14million to amortizable
intangible assets and $6million to net assumed
liabilities. No amounts have been allocated to in-process
research and development. Goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
intangible assets acquired and is not deductible for tax
purposes.   Transactions
completed in 2005   Verdisoft.On February11, 2005, the
Company acquired Verdisoft Corporation Verdisoft,
a software development company. The acquisition of Verdisoft
enhanced the Companys platform for delivering content and
services to mobile devices as part of the Companys
strategy to provide users with seamless access to its network.
The transaction was treated as an asset acquisition for
accounting purposes and therefore no goodwill was recorded. The
purchase price was $58million and consisted of
$54million in cash consideration, $3million related
to stock options exchanged and $1million of direct
transaction costs. In connection with the acquisition, the
Company also issued approximately 1million shares of
restricted stock valued at $35million that will be
recognized as expense over three years as the Companys
right to repurchase these shares lapses on the third anniversary
of the date of grant. For accounting purposes, $93million
was allocated to amortizable intangible assets, $37million
to liabilities, primarily deferred income tax liabilities, and
$2million to deferred stock-based compensation of which
the outstanding balance on January1, 2006 was netted
against additional paid-in capital upon the adoption of
SFAS123R. The amortizable intangible assets have useful
lives not exceeding four years and a weighted average useful
life of approximately 3years.   Yahoo! Europe and Yahoo! Korea.In November
1996, the Company entered into joint ventures with SOFTBANK
Corp. together with its consolidated affiliates,
SOFTBANK whereby separate companies were formed in
the United Kingdom, France and Germany collectively,
Yahoo! Europe, which established and managed local
versions of Yahoo! in those countries. In August 1997, the
Company entered into a similar joint venture with SOFTBANK in
Korea. Prior to November 2005, the Company had a majority share
of approximately 70percent in each of the Yahoo! Europe
entities and 67percent in Yahoo! Korea and therefore the
results of these entities were included in the Companys
consolidated financial statements, with minority interests
separately presented on the consolidated statements of income
and consolidated balance sheets. On November23, 2005, the
Company purchased SOFTBANKs remaining shares in the joint
ventures giving the Company 100percent ownership in these
entities.   The total purchase price of $501million consisted of
$500million in cash consideration and direct transaction
costs of $1million.

Combinations.During the year ended
December31, 2005, the Company acquired four other
companies which were accounted for as business combinations.
The total purchase price for these four acquisitions was
$79million and consisted of $72million in cash
consideration, $3million related to stock options
exchanged and $3million of direct transaction costs. The
total cash consideration of $72million less cash acquired
of $3million resulted in net cash outlay of
$69million. Of the purchase price, $58million was
allocated to goodwill, $32million to amortizable
intangible assets and $11million to net assumed
liabilities. Approximately $1million was allocated to
in-process research and development and expensed in the
consolidated statements of income. Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
tangible and intangible assets acquired and is not deductible
for tax purposes.   During 2005, the Company also made a strategic investment in
Alibaba.com Corporation Alibaba see
Note4 Investments in Equity
Interests.   Transactions
completed in 2006   Seven.On January29, 2006, the Company
and Seven Network Limited Seven, a leading
Australian media company, completed a strategic partnership in
which the Company contributed its Australian Internet business,
Yahoo! Australia and New Zealand Yahoo! Australia,
and Seven contributed its online assets, television and magazine
content, an option to purchase its 33percent ownership
interest in mobile solutions provider m.Net Corporation Ltd, and
cash of $7million. The Company believes this strategic
partnership and the contribution of the respective businesses
with their rich media and entertainment content will create a
comprehensive and engaging online experience for local users and
advertisers. The Company obtained a 50percent equity
ownership interest in the newly formed entity, which operates as
Yahoo! 7. Pursuant to a shareholders agreement and a
power of attorney granted by Seven to vote certain of its
shares, the Company has the right to vote501percent
of the outstanding voting interests in Yahoo! 7 and control over
the
day-to-day
operations and therefore consolidates Yahoo!7, which
includes the operations of Yahoo! Australia. For accounting
purposes, the Company is considered to have acquired the assets
contributed by Seven in exchange for 50percent of the
ownership of Yahoo! Australia. Accordingly, the Company
accounted for this transaction in accordance with
SFASNo141 Business Combinations. The
total estimated purchase price was $35million including
direct transaction costs of $2million.

the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
intangible assets acquired and is not deductible for tax
purposes.   As a result of this transaction, the Companys ownership in
Yahoo! Australia, which is now part of Yahoo!7, decreased
to 50percent. The Company effectively recognized a
non-cash gain of approximately $30million representing the
difference between the fair value of Yahoo! Australia and its
carrying value adjusted for the Companys continued
ownership in Yahoo! 7. This non-cash gain was accounted for as a
capital transaction and recorded as additional paid-in capital
because of certain future events that could affect actual
realization of the gain. The Company also recorded a minority
interest of $7million related to its reduced ownership of
Yahoo! Australia and Sevens retained interest in their
contributed net assets.   Investment in Gmarket.On June12, 2006,
the Company acquired an approximate 10percent interest in
Gmarket Inc., a retail
e-commerce
provider in South Korea, for $61million, including direct
transaction costs of approximately $1million.   Other Acquisitions Business
Combinations.During the year ended
December31, 2006, the Company acquired three other
companies which were accounted for as business combinations.
The total purchase price for these three acquisitions was
$42million and consisted of $41million in cash
consideration and $1million of direct transaction costs.
The total cash consideration of $41million less cash
acquired of $1million resulted in net cash outlay of
$40million. Of the purchase price, $27million was
allocated to goodwill, $21million to amortizable
intangible assets and $6million to net assumed
liabilities. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible
assets acquired and is not deductible for tax purposes.   In each of the three years ended December31, 2004, 2005,
and 2006, the Company also completed immaterial asset
acquisitions that did not qualify as business combinations.   Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for the
acquisitions completed during the years ended December31,
2005 and 2006 as the results of the acquired companies, not
already consolidated, either individually or in the aggregate
were not material to the Companys consolidated financial

1,758,401     1,891,834   Equity Investment in Alibaba.On
October23, 2005, the Company acquired approximately
46percent of the outstanding common stock of Alibaba,
which represented approximately 40percent on a fully
diluted basis, in exchange for $10billion in cash, the
contribution of the Companys China based businesses,
including 3721 Yahoo! China and direct transaction
costs of $8million. Pursuant to the terms of a
shareholder agreement, the Company has an approximate
35percent voting interest in Alibaba, with the remainder
of its voting rights subject to a voting agreement with Alibaba
management. Other investors in Alibaba include SOFTBANK. The
investment in Alibaba is being accounted for using the equity
method, and the total investment, including net tangible assets,
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, is classified as
part of investments in equity interests on the Companys
consolidated balance sheets. The Company records its share of
the results of Alibaba and any related amortization expense, one
quarter in arrears, within earnings in equity interests on the
consolidated statements of income.   Through this transaction, the Company has combined its leading
search capabilities with Alibabas leading online
marketplace and online payment system and Alibabas strong
local presence, expertise and vision in the China market. These
factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of the
Companys share of the fair value of Alibabas net
tangible and intangible assets acquired resulting in goodwill.   The purchase price was based on acquiring a 40percent
equity interest in Alibaba on a fully diluted basis. As of
December31, 2006, the Companys ownership interest in
Alibaba was 44percent, an approximate 2percent
decrease from the initial investment, primarily as a result of
the conversion of Alibabas outstanding convertible debt in
April 2006. The Companys ownership interest in Alibaba may
be further diluted to 40percent upon exercise of
Alibabas employee stock options. The Company will
recognize non-cash gains if and when such further dilution to
its ownership interest in Alibaba occurs, as such reduction in
interest results in an incremental sale of Yahoo! China. In
allocating the excess of the carrying value of its investment in
Alibaba over its proportionate share of the net assets of
Alibaba, the Company allocated a portion of the excess to
goodwill to account for the estimated reductions in the carrying
value of the investment in Alibaba that may occur as the
Companys equity interest is diluted to 40percent.
As a result, the reduction in ownership interest of
2percent upon the conversion of Alibabas outstanding
convertible debt did not result in any impact on the
consolidated statements of income other than for the non-cash
gain related to such reduction being treated as an incremental
sale of Yahoo! China as discussed below.

The majority of assets are comprised primarily of goodwill and

exceeding seven years and a weighted average useful life of
approximately 5years. No amount has been allocated to
in-process research and development. Goodwill is not deductible
for tax purposes.   Following the acquisition date, Yahoo! China has not been
included in the Companys consolidated results but is
included within earnings in equity interests to the extent of
the Companys continued ownership interest in Alibaba. The
results of operations of Yahoo! China were not material to the
consolidated results of the Company for the year ended
December31, 2004 and the period from January1, 2005
to October23, 2005, the date of the divestiture of Yahoo!
China. In connection with the transaction, in the fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a non-cash gain of
$338million in other income, net, based on the difference
between the fair value of Yahoo! China and its carrying value
adjusted for the Companys continued ownership in the newly
combined entity.   As a result of the conversion of Alibabas outstanding
convertible debt described above, the Company recorded a
non-cash gain during the year ended December31, 2006 of
approximately $15million in other income, net to account
for an approximate 2percent reduction in the
Companys ownership interest in Alibaba from
46percent to 44percent, which was treated as an
incremental sale of additional equity interests in Yahoo! China.   As of December31, 2006, the Company had losses of
$34million, net of tax including $24million, net of
tax, related to amortization of intangible assets included in
retained earnings relating to its investment in Alibaba.   The Company also has commercial arrangements with Alibaba to
provide technical, development, and advertising services. For
the year ended December31, 2006, these transactions were
not material.   Equity
Investment in Yahoo! Japan.   During April 1996, the Company signed a joint venture agreement
with SOFTBANK, which was amended in September 1997, whereby
Yahoo! Japan Corporation Yahoo! Japan was formed.
Yahoo! Japan was formed to establish and manage a local version
of Yahoo! in Japan. During the years ended December31,
2005 and 2006, the Company received cash dividends from Yahoo!
Japan in the amounts of $11million and $13million,
respectively, which were recorded as reductions in the
Companys investment in Yahoo! Japan. The Company also has
commercial arrangements with Yahoo! Japan, consisting of
services, including algorithmic search services and sponsored
search services and the related traffic acquisition costs and
license fees. The net cost of these arrangements was
approximately $67million, $171million and
$246million for the years ended December31, 2004,
2005 and 2006, respectively. As of December31, 2005 and
2006, the Company has a net payable balance to Yahoo! Japan of
approximately $7million and $10million, respectively.   The investment in Yahoo! Japan is being accounted for using the
equity method and the total investment is classified as part of
the Investments in equity interests balance on the consolidated
balance sheets. The Company records its

within earnings in equity interests. The fair value of the
Companys approximate 34percent ownership in Yahoo!
Japan, based on the quoted stock price, was approximately
$8billion as of December31, 2006.   Prior to and during 2001, Yahoo! Japan acquired the
Companys equity interests in certain entities in Japan for
total consideration of approximately $65million, paid
partially in shares of Yahoo! Japan common stock and partially
in cash. As a result of the acquisition, the Company increased
its investment in Yahoo! Japan, which resulted in approximately
$41million of goodwill to be amortized over seven years.
The amortization ceased upon the adoption of SFAS142 on
January1, 2002. The carrying amount of the Companys
investment in Yahoo! Japan differs from the amount of the
underlying equity in net assets of Yahoo! Japan primarily as a
result of this goodwill.   As of December31, 2005 and 2006, the Company had
$304million and $451million, respectively, included
in retained earnings relating to its investment in Yahoo! Japan.   The following table presents Yahoo! Japans financial

and high-quality corporate securities. Investments in both fixed
rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a
degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have
their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in
interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less
income than expected in interest rates fall. The longer the
term of the securities, the more susceptible they are to changes
in market rates of interest and yields on bonds. Investments
are reviewed periodically to identify possible
other-than-temporary
impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which
fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of
the issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the
investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for
anticipated recovery in market value. The Company has the
intent and ability to hold these securities for a reasonable
period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair
value up to or beyond the initial cost of the investment. The
Company expects to realize the full value of all of these
investments upon maturity or sale.   
Note9
Long-Term
Debt   In April 2003, the Company issued $750million of zero
coupon senior convertible notes the Notes due
April 2008, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of
approximately $733million after transaction fees of
$17million, which have been deferred and are included on
the consolidated balance sheets in long-term other assets. As of
December31, 2006, $4million of the transaction fees
remained to be amortized. The Notes were issued at par and bear
no interest. The Notes are convertible into Yahoo! common stock
at a conversion price of $2050per share, which would
result in the issuance of an aggregate of approximately
37million shares, subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of specified events. Each $1,000 principal amount of
the Notes will initially be convertible into 4878shares
of Yahoo! common stock.   The Notes are convertible prior to the final maturity date
1during any fiscal quarter if the closing sale price of
the Companys common stock for at least 20 trading days in
the 30
trading-day
period ending on the last trading day of the immediately
preceding fiscal quarter exceeded 110percent of the
conversion price on that 30thtrading day, 2during
the period beginning January1, 2008 through the maturity
date, if the closing sale price of the Companys common
stock on the previous trading day was 110percent or more
of the then current conversion price and 3upon specified
corporate transactions. Upon conversion, the Company has the
right to deliver cash in lieu of common stock. The Company may
be required to repurchase all of the Notes following a
fundamental change of the Company, such as a change of control,
prior to maturity at face value. The Company may not redeem the
Notes prior to their maturity.   As of December31, 2006, the market price condition for
convertibility of the Notes was satisfied with respect to the
fiscal quarter beginning January1, 2007 and ending on
March31, 2007. During this period holders of the Notes
will be able to convert their Notes into shares of Yahoo! common
stock at the rate of 4878shares of Yahoo! common   83 Table of Contents   Yahoo!
Inc.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   stock for each Note. The Notes will also be convertible into
shares of Yahoo! common stock in subsequent fiscal quarters, if
any, with respect to which the market price condition for
convertibility is met.   As of December31, 2006, the fair value of the Notes was
approximately $10billion based on quoted market prices.
The shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes have been
included in the computation of diluted net income per share
since the Notes were issued.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts
in order to conform to the current year presentation.   As of December31, 2006, the Companys federal and
state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes
were approximately $14billion and $03billion,
respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2008 and the state net
operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in   
85 Table of Contents   Yahoo!
Inc.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   2013. The Companys federal and state research tax credit
carryforwards for income tax purposes are approximately
$107million and $97million, respectively. If not
utilized, the federal research tax credit carryforwards will
begin to expire in 2010. The state research tax credit
carryforwards will not expire.   In 2006, gross deferred income tax assets decreased by
approximately $10billion primarily due to a change in
presentation as a result of the adoption of SFAS123R. The
reduction primarily relates to deferred income tax assets
pertaining to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
resulting from the exercise of employee stock options in prior
years and represents tax benefits in excess of stock-based
compensation expense as determined under APB25. In prior
years, such excess tax benefits, with an offsetting valuation
allowance, were recorded in the Companys consolidated
balance sheet. As the excess tax benefits were realized, the
valuation allowance was released and additional paid-in capital
was increased. SFAS123R prohibits recognition of a
deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock
option exercises that have not yet been realized through a
reduction in income taxes payable. Accordingly, in 2006 the
Company reversed the deferred tax asset and related valuation
allowance relating to excess tax benefits for stock option
exercises. Such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled
$11billion as of December31, 2006 and will be
accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital, if and
when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable. In
addition to the decrease in the valuation allowance described
above, the Company released $236million of the valuation
allowance to additional paid-in capital and $95million to
goodwill.   The Company has a valuation allowance of approximately
$96million as of December31, 2006 to reduce deferred
income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to
be realized in future periods. In evaluating the Companys
ability to recover its deferred income tax assets the Company
considers all available positive and negative evidence,
including operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts
of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction
basis. The valuation allowance as of December31, 2006
relates to foreign net operating loss and credit carryforwards
and will reduce the provision for income taxes if and when
recognized.   The Company provides United States income taxes on the earnings
of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings
are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United
States. As of December31, 2006, U.S.income taxes
were not provided for on a cumulative total of $07billion
of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries and a
corporate joint venture. These earnings are considered
indefinitely invested in operations outside the United States.
If these earnings were to be repatriated, the Company would be
subject to additional United Statesincome taxes subject
to an adjustment for foreign tax credits.   The Companys federal income tax return for the year ended
December31, 2003 is under examination by the Internal
Revenue Service.

Stockholders
Equity   Stockholder Rights Plan.In March 2001, the
Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan. Under the plan, the
rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one Right
for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as
of the close of business on March20, 2001. The Stockholder
Rights Plan was not adopted in response to any effort to acquire
control of the Company. The rights will expire on March1,
2011.   Stock Repurchases.In March 2005, following
the completion of the $05billion stock repurchase program
that was authorized in 2001 and extended in 2003, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up to $30billion of its outstanding shares of common
stock over the next five years, dependent on market conditions,
share price and other factors. Under this program, during the
year ended December31, 2005, the Company repurchased
117million shares of common stock at an average price of
$3320per share, for total consideration of
$388million. During the year ended December31,
2006, the Company repurchased 931million shares of common
stock at an average price of $2984per share, including
316million shares received upon the maturity of
structured stock repurchase transactions. Total cash
consideration for the stock repurchases in 2006 was
$28billion which consisted of $18billion direct
stock repurchases, $05billion as a result of settlements
of structured stock   
86 Table of Contents   Yahoo!
Inc.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   repurchase transactions entered into in 2005, and
$05billion as a result of settlements of structured stock
repurchase transactions entered into in 2006. Including the
$250million structured stock transaction settled in
October 2006, the Company had substantially completed the
$30billion authorized stock repurchase program as of
September30, 2006.   In October 2006, the Companys Board of Directors
authorized a new stock repurchase program allowing it to
repurchase up to $30billion of its outstanding shares of
common stock from time to time over the next five years,
depending on market conditions, share price, and other factors.
Repurchases may take place in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions, including derivative transactions, and
may be made under a
Rule10b5-1
plan.   On a cumulative basis, the Company has repurchased
1377million shares, which are recorded as part of
treasury stock. Treasury stock is accounted for under the cost
method.   Structured Stock Repurchases.During the year
ended December31, 2005, the Company entered into
$14billion in structured stock repurchase transactions.
Of these transactions, $07billion settled in 2005,
resulting in the Company receiving $07billion in cash.
During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company had
settlements of structured stock repurchase transactions for a
total amount of $05billion which the Company entered into
in 2005 resulting in repurchases of 151million shares at
an average price of $3288per share. A structured stock
repurchase transaction for the amount of $250million that
the Company entered into in 2005 was settled in cash resulting
in cash proceeds of $272million in 2006. The Company also
entered into structured stock repurchase transactions for a
total amount of $05billion in 2006. All of these
transactions were settled in stock during the year ended
December31, 2006 resulting in the repurchase of
165million shares at an average price of $3025per
share. The structured stock repurchase transactions were
recorded in stockholders equity on the consolidated
balance sheets.   
Note12
Employee
Benefits   Benefit Plans.The Company maintains a Yahoo!
Inc. 401k Plan the 401k Plan for its full-time
employees in the United States. The 401k Plan allows
employees of the Company to contribute up to the Internal
Revenue Code prescribed maximum amount. Employees may elect to
contribute from 1percent to 50percent of their
annual compensation to the 401k Plan. The Company matches
employee contributions at a rate of 25percent. Employee
contributions are fully vested, whereas vesting in matching
Company contributions occurs at a rate of 33percent per
year of employment. During 2004, 2005, and 2006, the
Companys contributions to the 401k Plan amounted to
approximately $8million, $12million, and
$16million, respectively. The Company also contributed
approximately $5million, $7million, and
$13million to its other benefit plans outside of the
United States for 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.   Stock-Based Compensation.Prior to
January1, 2006, the Company accounted for employee
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method
supplemented by pro forma disclosures in accordance with
APB25 and SFASNo123, as amended by
SFASNo148. Effective January1, 2006, the
Company adopted SFAS123R using the modified prospective
approach and accordingly prior periods have not been restated to
reflect the impact of SFAS123R.   For the year ended December31, 2006, the Company recorded
stock-based compensation expense of $425million. This
amount was reduced by a $13million $8million, net
of tax stock-based compensation expense reversal during the
year to correct stock-based compensation expense related to 2003
and 2004. For the year ended December31, 2006, as a result
of adopting SFAS123R, the Companys gross profit was
reduced by $7million, income from operations was lower by
$324million, and net income was lower by
$222million, than if the Company had continued to account
for stock-based compensation under APB25. Basic and
diluted net income per share for the year ended
December31, 2006 was $016 and $015 lower, respectively,
than if the Company had continued to account for stock-based
compensation under APB25. For the year ended
December31, 2005, the Company recognized $52million
of stock-based compensation expense under the intrinsic value
method. SFAS123R   
87 Table of Contents   Yahoo!
Inc.   Notes to Consolidated Financial
StatementsContinued   required that the deferred stock-based compensation on the
consolidated balance sheet on the date of adoption be netted
against additional paid-in capital. As of December31,
2005, there was a balance of $235million of deferred
stock-based compensation that was netted against additional
paid-in capital on January1, 2006.   SFAS123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time
of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Stock-based
compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures
for the year ended December31, 2006 such that expense was
recorded only for those stock-based awards that are expected to
vest. Previously under APB25 to the extent awards were
forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously
recognized expense was reversed in the period of forfeiture.
Upon the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company recorded a
cumulative adjustment to account for the expected forfeitures of
stock-based awards granted prior to January1, 2006 for
which the Company previously recorded an expense. This
adjustment was not material and was recorded as a reduction to
stock-based compensation expense in 2006.   In addition, upon the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company
included as part of cash flows from financing activities the
gross benefit of tax deductions related to stock-based awards in
excess of the grant date fair value of the related stock-based
awards for the options exercised during the year ended
December31, 2006 and certain options exercised in prior
periods. This amount is shown as a reduction to cash flows from
operating activities and an increase to cash flows from
financing activities. Net cash flows remain unchanged from what
would have been reported prior to the adoption of SFAS123R.   Stock Plans.The Companys 1995 Stock
Plan and stock-based award plans assumed through acquisitions
are collectively referred to as the Plans. The 1995
Stock Plan provides for the issuance of stock-based awards to
employees, including executive officers, and consultants. The
1995 Stock Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options,
non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, stock appreciation rights, indexed options, and dividend
equivalents.   Options granted under the 1995 Stock Plan before May19,
2005 generally expire tenyears after the grant date, and
options granted after May19, 2005 generally expire
7years after the grant date. Options generally become
exercisable over a four-year period based on continued
employment and vest either monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or
annually.   The 1995 Stock Plan permits the granting of restricted stock and
restricted stock units collectively referred to as
restricted stock awards. The vesting of restricted
stock awards is generally subject to meeting certain
performance-based objectives, the passage of time, or a
combination of both, and continued employment through the
vesting period. Restricted stock award grants are generally
measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number
of shares granted and the quoted price of the Companys
common stock. Such value is recognized as an expense over the
corresponding service period. Each share of the Companys
common stock issued in settlement of restricted stock awards is
counted as 175shares against the 1995 Stock Plans
share limit.   The 1995 Stock Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of
654million shares of which 51million were still
available for issuance as of December31, 2006.   The 1996Directors Stock Option Plan the
Directors Plan provides for the grant of
nonqualified stock options and restricted stock units to
non-employee directors of the Company. The Directors Plan
provides for the issuance of up to 9million shares of the
Companys common stock, of which approximately
5million were still available for issuance as of
December31, 2006. Each share of the Companys common
stock issued in settlement of restricted stock units granted
under the Directors Plan is counted as 175shares
against the Directors Plans share limit.   Options granted under the Directors Plan before
May25, 2006 generally become exercisable, based on
continued service as a director, for initial grants to new
directors, in equal monthly installments over four years, and
for annual grants, with 25percent of such options vesting
on the one year anniversary of the date of grant and the
remaining options vesting in equal monthly installments over the
remaining
36-month
period thereafter. Such options generally expire 10years
after the grant date. Options granted on or after May25,
2006 become exercisable, based

StatementsContinued   on continued service as a director, in equal quarterly
installments over one year. Such options generally expire seven
years after the grant date.   Restricted stock units granted under the Directors Plan
vest in equal quarterly installments over a one year period
following the date of grant and, once vested, are payable in an
equal number of shares of the Companys common stock on the
earlier of the third anniversary of the grant date or the date
the director ceases to be a member of the board.   Non-employee directors are also permitted to elect an award of
restricted stock units or a stock option under the
Directors Plan in lieu of a cash payment of fees for
serving as chairperson of a board committee. Such stock options
or restricted stock unit awards granted in lieu of cash for
chairperson fees are fully vested on the grant date.   Employee Stock Purchase Plan.The
Companys 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
Purchase Plan allows employees to purchase shares
of the Companys common stock through payroll deductions of
up to 15percent of their annual compensation subject to
certain Internal Revenue Code limitations. The price of common
stock purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to
85percent of the lower of the fair market value of the
common stock on the commencement date of each
24-month
offering period or the specified purchase date. The Purchase
Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of 30million
shares of common stock of which 12million shares were
available as at December31, 2006. For the year ended
December31, 2006, the stock-based compensation expense
related to the activity under the Purchase Plan was
$55million. As of December31, 2006, there was
$53million of unamortized stock-based compensation cost
related to the Purchase Plan which will be recognized over a
weighted average period of 12years.   Executive Retention Compensation
Agreement.During 2006, the Compensation
Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, approved a
three year performance and retention compensation arrangement
with the Companys Chief Executive Officer
CEO. For each of the years 2006 to 2008, the CEO
will be eligible to receive a discretionary annual bonus payable
in the form of a fully vested non-qualified stock option for up
to 1million shares with an exercise price equal to the
closing trading price of the Companys common stock on the
date of the grant. The Company recognized compensation expense
of $8million related to this potential 2006 performance
based award during the year ended December31, 2006.

ended December31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $1209, $1160,
and $1003per share, respectively.   The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the

the closing stock price of the Companys common stock on
December31, 2006 and the exercise price for
in-the-money
options that would have been received by the option holders if
all

ended December31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 were
$1,168million, $1,171million and $393million,
respectively.   As of December31, 2006, there was $498million of
unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested
stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of 34years.   Cash received from option exercises and purchases of shares
under the Purchase Plan for the year ended December31,
2006 was $318million.   The total tax benefit attributable to stock options exercised in
the year ended December31, 2006 was $144million.   The tax benefits from stock-based awards for the year ended
December31, 2006 was $626million, which is reported
on the consolidated statements of cash flows. This represents
the total amount of income tax benefit in the current period
related to options exercised in current and prior periods.   The gross excess tax benefits from stock-based awards for the
year ended December31, 2006 of $597million, as
reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows in
financing activities represent the reduction in income taxes
otherwise payable during the period, attributable to the actual
gross tax benefits in excess of the expected tax benefits for
options exercised in current and prior periods. The gross
excess tax benefits for the year ended December31, 2006
were comprised of $110million related to options exercised
during the twelve months ended December31, 2006 and
$487million related to options exercised in prior
periods. The Company has accumulated excess tax deductions
relating to stock options exercised prior to January1,
2006 available to reduce income taxes otherwise payable. To the
extent such deductions are expected to reduce income taxes
payable in the current year, they are reported as financing
activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.   The fair value of option grants is determined using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions

The risk-free interest rate is
based on the United States Treasury yield for a term consistent
with the expected life of the awards in effect at the time of
grant.
3
The Company estimates the
volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the
implied volatility of publicly traded options on its common
stock, with a term of one year or greater. Up to
September30, 2005, the Company used an equally weighted
average of trailing volatility and market based implied
volatility for the computation.

Commitments
and Contingencies   Operating Lease Commitments.The Company
leases office space and data centers under operating lease
agreements with original lease periods up to 23years which
expire between 2007 and 2027.   The Company has entered into the following material lease
agreements with minimum lease commitments as of
December31, 2006.   
In 2004, the Company entered into a 23year lease agreement
for office space in Sunnyvale, California with a total expected
minimum lease commitment of approximately $149million over
the lease term and a remaining minimum lease commitment of
approximately $139million as of December31, 2006.
The Company has the option to renew the lease for two additional
five year terms and the right of first offer to purchase the
leased office space if the lessor sells the building.     
In 2005, the Company entered into two ten year lease agreements
for data centers in the eastern United States with total
expected minimum lease commitments of approximately
$280million over the lease terms. One of these lease
agreements with total expected minimum lease commitments of
$172million was cancelled during 2005. The remaining
minimum lease commitments excluding the cancelled lease were
$97million as of December31, 2006. The Company has
the option to renew this lease for an additional five years and
also has a right of expansion for any additional lease space
that becomes available.     
In 2005, the Company entered into three ten year lease
agreements for office space in Southern California, with total
expected minimum lease commitments as per 2006 amendments of
approximately $159million over the lease terms and
remaining minimum lease commitments of approximately
$154million as of December31, 2006. In each of these
leases, the Company has the option to renew for two additional
terms of three to five years, as well as the right of expansion
for any additional lease space that becomes available. Further,
in the case of two of these leases, the Company has the right of
first offer to purchase the leased office space if the lessor
sells the building.     
In 2006, the Company entered into an eleven year lease agreement
for a data center in the eastern United States. As of
December31, 2006, the Company had total expected and
remaining minimum lease commitments of approximately
$191million over the lease term. The Company has the
option to renew this lease for an additional five years and also
has a right of expansion for any additional lease space that
becomes available.   Rent expense for all operating leases was approximately
$34million, $55million, and $73million for
2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.   Many of the Companys leases contain one or more of the
following options which the Company can exercise at the end of
the initial lease term: arenewal of the lease for a
defined number of years at the then fair market rental rate or
at a slight discount to the fair market rental rate;
bpurchase of the property at the then fair market value;
or cright of first offer to lease additional space that
becomes available.   Gross and net lease commitments as of December31, 2006 can

contracts to provide sponsored search
and/or

obligated to make payments, which represent traffic acquisition
costs, to its affiliates. As of December31, 2006, these
commitments totaled $17million, of which $16million
will be payable in 2007.   Other Commitments.In the ordinary course of
business, the Company may provide indemnifications of varying
scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business
partners and other parties with respect to certain matters,
including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the
Companys breach of agreements, services to be provided by
the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims
made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered
into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain
of its officers that will require the Company, among other
things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may
arise by reason of their status or service as directors or
officers. The Company has also agreed to indemnify certain
former officers, directors and employees of acquired companies
in connection with the acquisition of such companies. The
Company maintains director and officer insurance, which may
cover certain liabilities arising from its obligation to
indemnify its directors and officers, and former directors and
officers of acquired companies, in certain circumstances. It is
not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss
under these indemnification agreements due to the limited
history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such
indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss
clauses. Historically, the Company has not incurred material
costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and it
has not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification
obligations in its consolidated financial statements.   During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
reversed an earn-out accrual related to a prior acquisition,
which resulted in a $10million reduction to operating
expenses in the consolidated statements of income.   As of December31, 2006, the Company did not have any
relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities, which would have been
established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
As such, the Company is not exposed to any financing, liquidity,
market or credit risk that could arise if the Company had
engaged in such relationships.   Contractual Obligations.The following table

Contingencies.From time to time, third
parties assert patent infringement claims against Yahoo!.
Currently, the Company is engaged in several lawsuits regarding
patent issues and has been notified of a number of other
potential patent disputes. In addition, from time to time the
Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the
ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged
infringement of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other
intellectual property rights, claims related to employment
matters, and a variety of other claims, including

connection with the Companys
e-mail,
message boards, auction sites, shopping services and other
communications and community features.   On May24, 2001, Arista Records, Inc., Bad Boy Records, BMG
Music d/b/a The RCA Records Label, Capitol Records, Inc., Virgin
Records America, Inc., Sony Music Entertainment, Inc., UMG
Recordings, Inc., Interscope Records, Motown Record Company,
L.P., and Zomba Recording Corporation filed a lawsuit alleging
copyright infringement against LAUNCH Media, Inc.
LAUNCH in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs allege, among
other things, that the consumer-influenced portion of
LAUNCHs LAUNCHcast service is interactive
within the meaning of Section114 of the Copyright Act and
therefore does not qualify for the compulsory license provided
for by the Copyright Act. The Complaint seeks declaratory and
injunctive relief and damages for the alleged infringement.
After the lawsuit was commenced, the Company entered into an
agreement to acquire LAUNCH, which closed in August 2001, and
since that time LAUNCH has been a wholly owned subsidiary of
Yahoo!. Because LAUNCH settled the LAUNCH litigation as to all
other plaintiffs, BMG Music d/b/a/ The RCA Records Label is the
sole remaining plaintiff in this proceeding. On
November4, 2005, the Court issued an order denying the
plaintiffs summary judgment motions as to interactivity
and willful infringement. A trial date has been set for
April16, 2007. The Company does not believe it is feasible
to predict or determine the outcome or resolution of the LAUNCH
litigation at this time. The range of possible resolutions of
such LAUNCH litigation could include judgments against LAUNCH or
settlements that could require substantial payments by LAUNCH.   On July12, 2001, the first of several purported securities
class action lawsuits was filed in the United States District
Court, Southern District of New York against certain
underwriters involved in Overture Services Inc.s
Overture initial public offering, Overture, and
certain of Overtures current and former officers and
directors. The Court consolidated the cases against Overture.
Plaintiffs allege, among other things, violations of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
involving undisclosed compensation to the underwriters, and
improper practices by the underwriters, and seek unspecified
damages. Similar complaints were filed in the same court
against numerous public companies that conducted initial public
offerings of their common stock since the mid-1990s. All of
these lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial purposes before
Judge Shira Scheindlin. On April19, 2002, plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint, alleging
Rule10b-5
claims of fraud. On July15, 2002, the issuers filed an
omnibus motion to dismiss for failure to comply with applicable
pleading standards. On October8, 2002, the Court entered
an Order of Dismissal as to all of the individual defendants in
the Overture IPO litigation, without prejudice. On
February19, 2003, the Court denied the motion to dismiss
the
Rule10b-5
claims against certain defendants, including Overture. Overture
accepted a proposal for the settlement and release of claims
against the issuer defendants, including Overture. The
settlement was presented to the Court in June 2004. On
February15, 2005, the Court issued an order granting
conditional preliminary approval of the settlement proposal. On
August31, 2005, the Court issued an order confirming
preliminary approval of the settlement. On April24, 2006,
the Court held a fairness hearing in connection with the motion
for final approval of the settlement. The Court has yet to issue
a ruling on the motion for final approval. The settlement
remains subject to a number of conditions, including final
approval of the Court. On December5, 2006, the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Courts October
2004 order certifying a class in six test cases that were
selected by the underwriter defendants and plaintiffs in the
coordinated proceeding. Overture is not one of the test cases
and it is unclear what impact this will have on the class in
Overtures case. If the settlement does not occur, and
litigation against Overture continues, the Company intends to
defend the case vigorously.   The Company does not believe, based on current knowledge, that
any of the foregoing legal proceedings or claims are likely to
have a material adverse effect on its financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. However, the Company may
incur substantial expenses in defending against third party
claims. In the event of a determination adverse to the Company
or its subsidiaries, the Company may incur substantial monetary
liability and be required to change its business practices.
Either of these could have a material adverse effect on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Litigation
Settlement   In April 2002, the Companys wholly owned subsidiary,
Overture, filed a lawsuit against Google Inc.
Google in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California with respect to a patent which
protected various features and innovations relating to
bid-for-performance
products and Overtures
pay-for-performance
sponsored search technologies. In addition, the Company had a
second dispute with Google concerning the shares issuable to the
Company pursuant to a warrant held by the Company to purchase
Google shares that were received in connection with a June 2000
services agreement.   In August 2004, Google issued 27million shares of
ClassA common stock in settlement of the two disputes.
The Company agreed to dismiss the 361 patent lawsuits and
granted to Google a fully-paid license to the 361 patent as well
as several related patent applications held by Overture. The
Company allocated the 27million shares between the two
disputes, based on the relative fair values of the two disputes,
including consideration of a valuation performed by a third
party. A portion of the shares allocated to the patent dispute
has been recorded as an adjustment to goodwill for the period
that the patents were in effect prior to Overtures
acquisition by the Company. The portion of the shares received
for the settlement of the patent dispute which has been
allocated to future periods has been recorded in deferred
revenue on the consolidated balance sheets and will be
recognized as fees revenues over the remaining life of the
patent, approximately 12years. The shares allocated to
the warrant dispute settlement did not have an income statement
effect as the fair value of the warrant was recorded at the time
the services were performed based on the fair value of the
services rendered.   During the year ended December31, 2004, the Company
disposed of approximately 40million shares of Google and
realized gains of $413million, net of selling costs, which
were included in other income, net on the consolidated
statements of income. During the year ended December31,
2005 the Company sold the remaining Google shares and realized
gains of $961million, which were recorded in other income,
net.

Segments   The Company manages its business geographically. The primary
areas of measurement and decision-making are the United States
and International. Management relies on an internal management
reporting process that provides revenue and segment operating
income before depreciation, amortization and stock-based
compensation expense for making financial decisions and
allocating resources. Segment operating income before
depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense
includes income from operations before depreciation,
amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Management
believes that segment operating income before depreciation,
amortization and stock-based compensation expense is an
appropriate measure of evaluating the operational performance of
the Companys segments. However, this measure should be
considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior
to, income from operations or other measures of financial
performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States.
