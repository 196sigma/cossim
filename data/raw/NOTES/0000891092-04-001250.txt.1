INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc.
We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at . These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our
audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion,
such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in
Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, the Company
changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets to conform to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142.   /s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Nature of Operations
Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc.
and subsidiaries the Company owns and operates 24 network-affiliated
television stations in geographically diverse markets in the United States.
Ten of the stations are affiliates of the National Broadcasting Company,
Inc. NBC, eleven of the stations are affiliates of the American Broadcasting
Companies ABC, two of the stations are affiliates of Columbia Broadcasting
Systems CBS and one station is affiliated with Time Warner, Inc.s
Warner Brothers Television Network WB. Additionally, the Company provides
management services to two network-affiliated and one independent television
stations and two radio stations the Managed Stations. Based
upon regular assessments of the Companys operations, performed by
key management, the Company has determined that its material reportable
segment is commercial television broadcasting. The economic characteristics,
services, production process, customer type and distribution methods for
the Companys operations are substantially similar and have therefore
been aggregated as one reportable segment.
2. Summary of Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates
General
The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
except for the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary trust which was required
to be de-consolidated upon adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB Interpretation No. 46 revised December 2003,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46R.
The Company adopted FIN 46R as of December 31, 2003. See Reclassifications
and New Accounting Pronouncements below. With the exception
of the unconsolidated subsidiary trust, all significant intercompany accounts
have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered to
be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable
The Company extends credit
based upon its evaluation of a customers credit worthiness and financial
condition. For certain advertisers, the Company does not extend credit and
requires cash payment in advance. The Company monitors the collection of
receivables and maintains an allowance for estimated losses based upon the
aging of such receivables and specific collection issues that may be identified.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally
limited due to the large number of geographically diverse customers, individually
small balances, and short payment terms.
Program Rights
Program rights and the corresponding
contractual obligations are recorded when the license period begins and
the programs are available for use. Program rights are carried at the lower
of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value on a program by program
basis and such amounts are not discounted. Any reduction in unamortized
costs to net realizable value is included in amortization of program rights
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Such reductions in
unamortized costs for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were
not material. Costs of first-run programming are amortized over the license
period of the program, which is generally one year. Costs of off-network
syndicated products, feature films and cartoons are amortized on the future
number of showings on an accelerated basis contemplating the estimated revenue
to be earned per showing, but generally not exceeding five years. Program
rights and the corresponding contractual obligations are classified as current
or long-term based on estimated usage and payment terms, respectively.
Barter and Trade Transactions
Barter transactions represent
the exchange of commercial air time for programming. Trade transactions
represent the exchange of commercial air time for merchandise or services.
Barter transactions are generally recorded at the fair market value of the
commercial air time relinquished. Trade transactions are generally recorded
at the fair market value of the merchandise or services received. Barter
program rights and payables are recorded for barter transactions based upon
the availability of the broadcast property. Revenue is recognized on barter
and trade transactions when the commercials are broadcast; expenses are
recorded when the merchandise or service received is utilized. Barter and
trade revenues are included in total revenues on the consolidated statements
of income and were approximately $278 million, $284 million and $293
million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Of these amounts, trade revenues represented less than 20% in each of the
years. Barter and trade expenses are included in Salaries, benefits and
other operating costs under Station operating expenses on the consolidated
statements of income and were approximately $277 million, $281 million
and $293 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Of these amounts, trade expense represented less than 15%
in each of the years.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment
are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives as follows: buildings40 years; towers
and transmitters15 to 20 years; other broadcasting equipmentfive
to eight years; office furniture, computers, equipment and otherthree
to eight years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line
method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of
the asset. Management reviews, on a continuing basis, the financial statement
carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment. If events
or changes in circumstances were to indicate that an asset carrying value
may not be recoverable utilizing related undiscounted cash flows, a write-down
of the asset would be recorded through a charge to operations. The Company
has followed this policy for determining and measuring impairment of property
and equipment both prior and subsequent to the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144.
Management also reviews the continuing appropriateness of the useful lives
assigned to property, plant and equipment. Prospective adjustments to such
lives are made when warranted.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are recorded
at cost and include FCC licenses, network affiliations, goodwill, and other
intangible assets such as advertiser client base and favorable leases. On
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS 142. As a result, the Company no
longer amortizes goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
FCC licenses, but instead performs a review for impairment annually, or
earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. In connection with
the adoption of SFAS 142, amortization expense related to goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangibles decreased by approximately $827 million annually. See Note
4. Upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and again in the fourth
quarters of 2002 and 2003, the Company completed an impairment review and
found no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill or FCC licenses. Had
the Company used different assumptions in developing its estimates, the
Companys reported results may have varied. The Company considers the
assumptions used in its estimates to be reasonable. The Company amortizes
intangible assets with determinable useful lives over their respective estimated
useful lives to their estimated residual values. Upon adoption of SFAS 142
on January 1, 2002, the Company determined the remaining useful life of
its network affiliation intangible assets to be approximately 285 years
and the remaining useful life of its advertiser client base intangible asset
to be approximately 19 years. The Company amortizes favorable lease intangible
assets over the respective terms of each lease. In accordance with SFAS
144, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets
with determinable lives each reporting period to determine whether events
or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS
142 on January 1, 2002, the Company amortized goodwill and intangible assets
over periods ranging from three to 40 years. The recoverability of the carrying
values of goodwill and intangible assets was evaluated quarterly to determine
if an impairment in value had occurred. Pursuant to SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets, an impairment in value was
considered to have occurred when it has been determined that the undiscounted
future operating cash flows generated by the acquired business were not
sufficient to recover the carrying value of an intangible asset. If it had
been determined that an impairment in value had occurred, goodwill and intangible
assets would have been written down to an amount equivalent to the present
value of the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows to be generated
by the acquired business. At December 31, 2001, it was determined that there
had been no impairment of intangible assets.
Deferred Acquisition and Financing Costs
Acquisition costs are capitalized
and are included in the purchase price of the acquired stations. Financing
costs are deferred and are amortized using the interest method over the
term of the related debt when funded.
Investments
The Company has investments
in non-consolidated affiliates, which are accounted for under the equity
method if the Companys equity interest is from 20% to 50%, and under
the cost method if the Companys equity interest is less than 20% and
the Company does not exercise significant influence over operating and financial
policies. In addition, the Company has a wholly-owned unconsolidated subsidiary
trust which is accounted for under the equity method. See Note 7. The Company
evaluates its investments to determine if an impairment has occurred. Carrying
values are adjusted to reflect realizable value, where necessary.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
Revenue Recognition
The Companys primary
source of revenue is television advertising. Other sources include network
compensation and other revenues. Advertising revenues and network compensation
together represented approximately 97% of the Companys total revenues
in each of the years ended December 2003, 2002 and 2001.
Advertising Revenues. Advertising revenues
are recognized net of agency and national representatives commissions
and in the period when the commercials are broadcast. Barter and trade revenues
are included in advertising revenues and are also recognized when the commercials
are broadcast. See Barter and Trade Transactions above.
Network Compensation. Eleven of the Companys
stations have network compensation agreements with ABC, ten have agreements
with NBC, and two have agreements with CBS. In connection with the ABC and
CBS agreements, revenue is recognized when the Companys station broadcasts
specific network television programs based upon a negotiated value for each
program. In connection with the NBC agreements, revenue is recognized on
a straight-line basis, based upon the cash compensation to be paid to the
Companys stations by NBC each year. Unlike the ABC and CBS agreements,
the NBC network compensation is an annual amount and is not specifically
assigned to individual network television programs.
Other Revenues. The Company generates
revenue from other sources, which include the following types of transactions
and activities: i management fees earned from The Hearst Corporation Hearst
see Note 14; ii services revenue from Lifetime Entertainment Services
see Note 14; iii services revenue from the production of commercials
for advertising customers or from the production of programs to be sold
in syndication; iv rental income pursuant to tower lease agreements with
third parties providing for attachment of antennas to the Companys
towers; and v other miscellaneous revenues, such as licenses and royalties.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes
is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statements
of income. The Company provides for federal and state income taxes currently
payable, as well as for those deferred because of timing differences between
reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax
purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The Company records reserves
for estimates of probable settlements of federal and state audits. The results
of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the
ultimate settlement of these issues. The Company also records a valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating
losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such
net operating losses will not be realized. The Companys effective
tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted
by changes in the level of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, changes in the
expected outcome of tax audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation
allowance.
Earnings Per Share EPS
Basic EPS is calculated by
dividing net income less preferred stock dividends by the weighted average
common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated similarly, except that
it includes the dilutive effect, if any, of shares issuable under the Companys
stock option plan, the conversion of the Companys Preferred Stock
see Note 11, or the conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Securities held by the Companys wholly-owned unconsolidated subsidiary
trust see Note 7. All per share amounts included in the notes are the
same for basic and diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. See
Note 8.
Off-Balance Sheet Financings and Liabilities
Other than contractual commitments
and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business,
agreements for future barter and program rights not yet available for broadcast
as of December 31, 2003, and employment contracts for key employees, all
of which are disclosed in Note 15, the Company does not have any off-balance
sheet financings or liabilities. Other than its wholly-owned unconsolidated
subsidiary trust see Reclassifications and New Accounting
Pronouncements below, the Company does not have any majority-owned
subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial 
45
HEARST-ARGYLE TELEVISION, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
statements, nor does the Company have any interests in, or
relationships with, any special-purpose entities that are not reflected
in the consolidated financial statements.
Purchase Accounting
When allocating the purchase
price in a purchase transaction to the acquired assets tangible and intangible
and assumed liabilities, it is necessary to develop estimates of fair value.
The Company utilizes the services of an independent valuation consulting
firm for the purpose of estimating required fair values. The specialized
tangible assets in use at a broadcasting business are typically valued on
the basis of the replacement cost of a new asset less observed depreciation.
The appraisal of other fixed assets, such as furnishings, vehicles, and
office machines, is based upon a comparable market approach. Identified
intangible assets, including FCC licenses, are valued at estimated fair
value. FCC licenses are valued using a direct approach. The direct approach
measures the economic benefits that the FCC license brings to its holder.
The fair market value of the FCC license is determined by discounting these
future benefits utilizing discounted cash flows. The key assumptions used
in the discounted cash flow analysis include initial and subsequent capital
costs, network affiliation, VHF or UHF status, market revenue growth and
station market share projections, operating profit margins, discount rates
and terminal value estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for
employee stock-based compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
APB No. 25, Stock Issued to Employees APB 25
and related interpretations. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of
the Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, the stock options have no intrinsic
value and therefore no compensation expense is recognized. The Company has
adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting
For Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. Under SFAS 123,
options are valued at their date of grant and then expensed over
their vesting period. See Note 12.
The following table details

The Company accounts for
the income tax benefit resulting from the deduction triggered by the exercise
of employee stock options as a credit to stockholders equity additional
paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements
of stockholders equity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF Issue No. 00-15, Classification in the Statement of
Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise
of a Non-Qualified Employee Stock Option, the Company classifies the
reduction of income taxes payable, as a result of the deduction triggered
by the exercise of employee stock options, as an increase in operating cash
flow on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated
financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those
related to allowances for doubtful accounts; program rights, barter and
trade transactions; useful lives of property, plant and equipment; intangible
assets;
46
HEARST-ARGYLE TELEVISION, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
carrying value of investments; accrued liabilities; contingent
liabilities; income taxes; pension benefits; and fair value of financial
instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
For comparability, certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation.
Most significantly, in connection with the Companys adoption of FIN
46R, the Company has de-consolidated its wholly-owned subsidiary trust
in all periods presented. See New Accounting Pronouncements
below. In addition, in December 2003, the Company reclassified $669 million
of its net goodwill balance to a separately identified intangible asset,
advertiser client base. Accordingly, for comparability, the Company has
made this reclassification in all periods presented. With respect to the
reclassification of the advertiser client base, the Company resumed amortization
and recorded a catch-up to amortization expense of $71 million in the fourth
quarter of 2003, bringing the net book value of the advertiser client base
to approximately $598 million as of December 31, 2003. See Note 4.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In April 2003, FASB issued
SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities SFAS 149. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives
and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts
entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, except in certain instances,
and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. In addition,
except in those certain instances, all provisions of SFAS 149 should be
applied prospectively. Since the Company was not involved in any derivative
financial instruments, SFAS 149 had no effect upon the Companys consolidated
financial statements in the year ended December 31, 2003.
In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics
of Both Liabilities and Equity SFAS 150. SFAS 150 establishes
standards for how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments
with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 is effective
for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and
otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003. The Company has determined that SFAS 150 does not affect
the classification or measurement of any of its financial instruments.
In December 2003, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 132 revised 2003, Employers Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits - an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88 and 106 SFAS 132R. SFAS 132R is effective
for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. Interim disclosure requirements
under SFAS 132R will be effective for interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2003, and required disclosures related to estimated benefit
payments will be effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004.
SFAS 132R replaces the disclosure requirements in SFAS No. 87, Employers
Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87, SFAS No. 88, Employers
Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans
and for Termination Benefits SFAS 88, and SFAS 106, Employers
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions SFAS
106. SFAS 132R addresses disclosures only and does not address
measurement and recognition accounting for pension and postretirement benefits.
SFAS 132R requires additional disclosures related to the description of
plan assets including investment strategies, plan obligations, cash flows
and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension and other defined
benefit postretirement plans. Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted
the disclosure requirements of SFAS 132R with the exception of future
expected benefit payments, which becomes effective for the Company for fiscal
years ending after June 15, 2004 or December 31, 2004.
In December 2003, the FASB
issued FIN 46R, which served to clarify the guidance in Financial Interpretation
No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46,
and provided additional guidance surrounding the application of FIN 46.
FIN 46 establishes consolidation criteria for entities for which control
is not easily discernable under Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated
Financial Statements, which is based on the premise that holders of
an entity control the entity by virtue of voting rights. FIN 46R provides
guidance for identifying the party with a controlling financial interest
resulting from arrangements or financial interests rather than from voting
interests. FIN 46 established standards for determining the circumstances
under which an entity defined as a variable interest entity should be
consolidated based upon an evaluation of financial interests and other arrangements
rather than voting control. FIN 46 also requires disclosure about any variable
interest entities that the Company is not required to consolidate, but in
which it has a significant variable interest. Application of FIN 46R is
required for companies that have interests in those entities that are considered
to be special-purpose entities, beginning in periods ending after December
15, 2003, and application is required for interests in all other types of
entities beginning in periods ending after March 15, 2004.
47
HEARST-ARGYLE TELEVISION, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
The Company adopted and applied
the provisions of FIN 46R as of December 31, 2003 with respect to its
wholly-owned trust subsidiary, the Hearst-Argyle Capital Trust hereafter
the Capital Trust, which is considered to be a special-purpose
entity. The adoption of FIN 46R required the Company to de-consolidate
the Capital Trust in its financial statements. In order to present the Capital
Trust as an unconsolidated subsidiary, the Company adjusted the presentation
in its consolidated balance sheets as follows, for all periods presented:
i reclassified the amount of $2000 million, which was previously classified
as Company obligated redeemable convertible preferred securities of
subsidiary trust holding solely parent company debentures to Note
payable to Capital Trust; ii presented an investment in the Capital
Trust of $62 million, which is included under Investments see
Note 3; and iii presented a long-term note payable to the Capital Trust
of $62 million, which is included under Note payable to Capital Trust,
bringing the total Note payable to Capital Trust to $2062 million
see Note 7. Once the redeemable convertible preferred securities have
been redeemed or reached maturity, the investment in the Capital Trust of
$62 million will be offset by the long-term note payable to the Capital
Trust of $62 million, resulting in no effect to the Companys consolidated
income statement. In addition, the Company adjusted the presentation in
our consolidated income statements in all periods presented to reclassify
the amounts previously recorded as Dividends on redeemable convertible
preferred securities to Interest expense, net Capital
Trust. These changes required under FIN 46R represent financial
statement presentation only and are not a result of any changes to the legal,
financial, or operating structure of the Capital Trust. With respect to
any other entities, such as the Companys Managed Stations, which could
potentially be affected by FIN 46R and for which the application date
of FIN 46R is the end of the first quarter of 2004, the Company is currently
evaluating the impact, if any. Although the Company does not believe the
full adoption of FIN 46R will have a material impact on its net income,
the Company cannot make any definitive determination until it has completed
its evaluation.
In January 2004, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position FSP 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 FSP 106-1, which allowed companies to elect
a one-time deferral of the recognition of the effects of the Medicare Prescription
Drug Act in accounting for their plans under SFAS 106 and in providing disclosures
related to the plan required by SFAS 132R. The FASB allowed the one-time
deferral due to the accounting issues raised by the Medicare Prescription
Drug Act - in particular, the accounting for the federal subsidy that is
not explicitly addressed in SFAS 106 - and due to the fact that uncertainties
exist as to the direct effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act and
its ancillary effects on plan participants. For companies electing the one-time
deferral, such deferral remains in effect until authoritative guidance on
the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued, or until certain other
events, such as a plan amendment, settlement or curtailment, occur. We are
currently evaluating the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act on
our other postretirement benefit plan and its participants, and have elected
the one-time deferral. The Companys accumulated post-retirement benefit
obligation and net post-retirement benefit cost for 2003 does not reflect
the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act. Additionally, once the
specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy
is issued, it could result in a change to previously reported information.
3. Acquisitions, Dispositions and Investments
Phoenix/WMUR Swap.
On March 28, 2001, the Company exchanged its radio stations in Phoenix,
Arizona KTAR-AM, KMVP-AM and KKLT-FM the Phoenix Stations
for WMUR-TV, the ABC affiliate serving Manchester, New Hampshire, which
is part of the Boston, Massachusetts television market, in a three-party
swap the Phoenix/WMUR Swap. The Company sold the Phoenix Stations
to Emmis Communications Corporation Emmis for $1600 million,
less transaction expenses, and purchased WMUR-TV from
WMUR-TV, Inc. for $1850 million, plus a working capital adjustment of $35
million and transaction expenses. The acquisition of WMUR-TV was accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the purchase
price and related transaction expenses were allocated to the acquired assets
and liabilities based upon their fair market values. Prior to the Phoenix/WMUR
Swap, Emmis had been managing the Phoenix Stations pursuant to a Time Brokerage
Agreement TBA since August 1, 2000, and the Company had been
managing WMUR-TV pursuant to a TBA since January 8, 2001 effective January
1, 2001 for accounting purposes until the acquisition on March 28, 2001.
The purchase price of WMUR-TV was funded through an intermediary by approximately:
i $1600 million from Emmis, and ii $285 million plus the cost of the
transaction expenses from the Companys revolving credit facility.
The Company realized a gain of $726 million on the sale of the Phoenix
Stations which is recorded in Other income, net in the accompanying consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2001.
WBOY-TV Acquisition and
Disposition. On April 30, 2001, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement
entered into with WBOY-TV, Inc., the Company acquired WBOY-TV, the NBC affiliate
serving the Clarksburg-Weston, West Virginia television market for $200
million the WBOY Acquisition plus a working capital adjustment
of $07 million and transaction expenses. The WBOY Acquisition was accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the purchase
price and related transaction expenses have been allocated to the acquired
assets and liabilities based upon their fair market values. The purchase
price plus the cost of transaction expenses were funded using the Companys
revolving credit facility. The Company 
48
HEARST-ARGYLE TELEVISION, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
later sold WBOY-TV on December 13, 2001 for $200 million
plus a working capital adjustment of $08 million less transaction expenses.
Investment in Internet
Broadcasting Systems, Inc. On December 2, 1999, the Company entered
into a series of agreements with Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc. IBS
and invested $20 million in exchange for an equity interest in IBS. With
IBS, the Company and other broadcasters have invested in the development
and management of local  websites. In May
2001, the Company invested an additional $6 million for a total investment
of $26 million in IBS. The following provides a description of the key agreements,
along with the associated accounting where appropriate:
Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.
This agreement was entered into between IBS and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company, as well as other investors. Pursuant to this agreement,
the Company initially invested $20 million in IBS. As of December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, the Company had an equivalent equity interest in IBS of approximately
24% in each year. Accordingly, this investment is accounted for using the
equity method. The Companys share in the results of IBS is included
in Equity in income loss of affiliates in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.
IBS/HATV LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement.
This agreement was entered into by the Company and IBS to establish the
IBS/HATV LLC, of which the Company owns 499% and IBS owns 501%. The IBS/HATV
LLC is controlled and managed by IBS and is the parent company of 24 wholly-owned
subsidiary limited liability companies established to own and operate the
websites for each of the Companys television stations. The term of
the agreement is indefinite until an agreement is reached by the parties
to terminate. Under this agreement, net losses incurred by the IBS/HATV
LLC are allocated 100% to IBS. Net income is to be allocated in proportion
to the ownership interests. Through September 30, 2002, the IBS/HATV LLC
incurred net losses since its inception in December 1999. In the fourth
quarter of 2002, the IBS/HATV LLC achieved profitability and the Company
began to record its 499% share of net income using the equity method. The
Companys share in the results of the IBS/HATV LLC is included in Equity
in income loss of affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statements
of income for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.
Website Development and Operating Agreement.
This agreement was entered into by the Company, IBS, and the IBS/HATV LLC.
The initial term of the agreement is six years, with additional three-year
renewal terms unless a party gives written notice of its intention not to
renew. Under this agreement, IBS designs, develops and operates each of
the Companys stations websites owned by the wholly-owned subsidiary
companies under the IBS/HATV LLC. The accounting for the activities under
this agreement is included in the accounts and financial results of the
IBS/HATV LLC.
Website License Agreement. This agreement
was entered into by the Company, IBS, and the IBS/HATV LLC and runs co-terminous
with the Website Development and Operating Agreement described above. Under
this agreement, the Company has granted to IBS a non-exclusive license to
use and display certain programming content and Company trademarks and logos
on the each of the websites owned by the wholly-owned subsidiary companies
under the IBS/HATV LLC.
In connection with the above
agreements, the Company is able to offer its customers advertising packages
containing both spot television as well as internet advertising. In the
sale of such packages, the Company acts as the sales agent to each of the
subsidiary companies under the IBS/HATV LLC. The revenue from spot advertising
revenues is recognized by the Companys stations, and the revenue from
internet advertising is recognized by the subsidiary companies under the
IBS/HATV LLC.
Investment in ProAct
Technologies Corporation. On March 22, 2000, the Company invested
$250 million in ProAct Technologies Corporation ProAct for
an equity interest in ProAct. ProAct is a provider of human resources and
benefits management solutions for employers and health plans. As this investment
represents less than a 20% interest in ProAct, the investment is accounted
for using the cost method. In March 2001, the Company wrote-down its investment
in ProAct by $188 million in order to approximate the investments
realizable value. The write-down is included in Other income, net in the
accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December
31, 2001. The Company has received revenue from ProAct relating to advertising
sales. See Note 14.
Investment in Geocast
Network Systems, Inc. In February 2001, the Company wrote-off its remaining
basis of $51 million of its total $100 million investment in Geocast Network
systems, Inc. Geocast after Geocasts Board of Directors
declined various strategic alternatives and decided to liquidate the company.
The write-down is included in Other income, net in the accompanying consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2001.
49
HEARST-ARGYLE TELEVISION, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
Investment in NBC/Hearst-Argyle
Syndication, LLC. On August 7, 2001, the Company contributed its production-and-distribution
unit to NBC/Hearst-Argyle Syndication, LLC in exchange for a 20% equity
interest in this entity. NBC/Hearst-Argyle Syndication, LLC is a limited
liability company formed by NBC Enterprises and the Company to produce and
syndicate first-run broadcast and original-for-cable programming. This investment
is accounted for using the equity method. The Companys share in the
results of NBC/Hearst-Argyle Syndication, LLC is included in Equity in income
loss of affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statements of income
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.
Investment in Capital
Trust. On December 20, 2001, the Company purchased all of the Capital
Trusts common stock valued at $62 million as part of the initial
capitalization of the Capital Trust, and the Company received $2000 million
in connection with the issuance of the Subordinated Debentures valued at
$2062 million to the Capital Trust. The Subordinated Debentures are presented
as Note payable to Capital Trust in the Companys consolidated balance
sheets. The Capital Trust does not hold any other significant assets other
than the $2062 million in note receivable from the Company for the Subordinated
Debentures. In accordance with the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company
does not consolidate the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Capital
Trust, in its consolidated financial statements. Therefore, this investment
is accounted for using the equity method. Since the only earnings attributable
to this investment are the Companys interest payments on the $62
million portion of the Subordinated Debentures, the Company has recorded
its share in the earnings of the Capital Trust as an offset to the interest
expense that the Company pays on the Subordinated Debentures. See Note 7.
4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
On January 1, 2002, the Company
adopted SFAS 142, which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be assessed
for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based test. The
Companys intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are licenses
to operate its television stations which have been granted by the Federal
Communications Commission FCC. SFAS 142 also requires that
intangible assets with determinable useful lives be amortized over their
respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144.
The Company completed its initial
goodwill impairment review during the first quarter of 2002 and its annual
goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002 using
a fair value approach in accordance with SFAS 142 and found no impairment
to the carrying value of the Companys goodwill or FCC licenses. In
2002, the Company made an adjustment of approximately $04 million to the
carrying value of goodwill to finalize certain purchase accounting adjustments.
The Company, as an FCC licensee,
enjoys an expectancy of continued renewal of its licenses, so long as it
continues to provide service in the public interest. The FCC has historically
renewed the Companys licenses in the ordinary course of business,
without compelling challenge and at little cost to the Company. Furthermore,
the Company believes that over-the-air broadcasting will continue as a video
distribution mode for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the cash flows
derived from the Companys FCC licenses are expected to continue indefinitely
and as such, and in accordance with SFAS 142, the life of the FCC license
intangible asset is deemed to be indefinite.
In December 2003, the Company
reversed a reclassification it had made in December 2001 related to a separately
identified intangible asset, advertiser client base. In December 2001, the
Company had reclassified the remaining net book value of the advertiser
client base $669 million to goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet.
In December 2003, the Company determined the advertiser client base should
continue to be separately identified from goodwill. Accordingly, in December
2003, the Company reversed its previous reclassification made in December
2001 and therefore the classification of the advertiser client base has
reverted to the Companys balance sheet presentation prior to December
2001. Since the advertiser client base is considered to be an intangible
asset with a determinable useful life under SFAS 142, it is required to
be amortized over its estimated useful life. Accordingly, the Company resumed
amortization and recorded a catch-up to amortization expense on the advertiser
client base of $71 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, bringing the
net book value of the advertiser client base to approximately $598 million
as of December 31, 2003.

Credit Facility
On April 12, 1999, the Company
retired its existing $1 billion revolving credit facility and replaced it
with two new revolving credit facilities the New Credit Facilities
with a consortium of banks led by JP Morgan Chase Bank formerly known as
The Chase Manhattan Bank Chase, Bank of New York, Toronto
Dominion and Bank of Montreal. The New Credit Facilities were structured
as a $1 billion revolver the $1 Billion Facility and a $250
million 364-day facility the $250 Million Facility. Management
elected not to renew the $250 Million Facility on April 10, 2000.
On August 15, 2001, the Company
exercised its contractual right to reduce the lender commitments of the
$1 Billion Facility to $750 million hereafter, the Credit Facility.
On December 24, 2003, the Company again exercised its contractual right
and further reduced the lender commitments to $500 million. The Credit Facility,
which was fully repaid as of December 31, 2003 and had an outstanding balance
of $91 million as of December 31 2002, will mature on April 12, 2004.
Outstanding principal balances
under the Credit Facility bear interest at either, at the Companys
option, LIBOR or the alternate base rate ABR, plus the applicable
margin. The applicable margin for ABR loans is zero. The
applicable margin for LIBOR loans varies between 075% and 125%
depending on the ratio of the Companys total debt to operating cash
flow leverage ratio. The ABR is the higher of i Chases
prime rate; ii 1% plus the secondary market rate for three month certificates
of deposit; or, iii 05% plus the rates on overnight federal funds transactions
with members of the Federal Reserve System. The Company is required to pay
an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the Credit Facility.
The commitment fee ranges from 02% to 03%. For the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the effective interest rate on borrowings from
the Credit Facility outstanding during the year was 38%, 41% and 53    respectively. The Credit Facility is a general unsecured obligation of the
Company.
Senior Notes
The Company issued $125 million
principal amount of 70% senior notes due 2007, priced at 99616% of par,
and $175 million principal amount of 75% debentures due 2027, priced at
98823% of par, on November 7, 1997 and $200 million principal amount of
70% senior notes due 2018, priced at 98887% of par, on January 13, 1998
collectively, the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are senior
and unsecured obligations of the Company. Proceeds from the Senior Notes
offerings were used to repay existing indebtedness of the Company. See discussion
of Private Placement Debt and Senior Subordinated Notes below.
During 2000, the Company repaid
i $280 million of its 75% Senior Notes due November 15, 2027, at a discounted
price of $248 million, and ii $227 million of its 70% Senior Notes
due January 15, 2018, at a discounted price of $196 million. The Company
wrote-off the pro-rata share of deferred financing fees related to the Senior
Notes which were repaid.
During 2001, the Company
repaid i $13 million of its 70% Senior Notes due January 15, 2018, at
a discounted price of $11 million, and ii $159 million of its 75% Senior
Notes due November 15, 2027, at a discounted price of $143 million. These
repayments were funded by the Credit Facility. The Company wrote-off the
pro-rata share of deferred financing fees related to the Senior Notes which
were repaid. The discounts from the repayments, net of the write-off of
the deferred financing fees, resulted in a gain of approximately $09 million,
before income tax expense, which was reclassified as Interest expense, net
in the accompanying consolidated statement of income in the year ended December
31, 2001, in accordance with SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.

Private Placement Debt
In connection with its acquisition
of KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California on January 1, 1999, the Company issued
$450 million in senior notes to institutional investors the Private
Placement Debt. Of the $450 million principal amount, $340 million
was issued on December 15, 1998 and $110 million was issued on January 14,
1999. The Private Placement Debt is a general unsecured obligation of the
Company with a maturity of 12 years, an average life of 10 years, and an
interest rate of 718% per annum. The Company used the proceeds from the
Private Placement Debt to partially fund the acquisition of KCRA-TV. The
Private Placement Debt matures in installments of $90 million per year beginning
in 2006.
Capital Lease Obligations
The Company has capitalized
the future minimum lease payments of equipment under leases that qualify
as capital leases. The Company had capital lease obligations of approximately
$05 million and $04 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The capital leases have terms which expire in various years through 2008.
Senior Subordinated Notes
In October 1995, Argyle Television,
Inc., which was merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hearst on August
29, 1997 hereafter the Hearst Transaction, issued $150 million
of senior subordinated notes the Senior Subordinated Notes,
which were due in 2005 and bore interest at 975% payable semi-annually.
The Senior Subordinated Notes were general unsecured obligations of the
Company. In December 1997 and February 1998, the Company repaid $45 million
and $1024 million, respectively. In July 2002, the Company repaid the remaining
balance of $26 million. In connection with the redemption, the Company
paid a premium of approximately $84,000, which has been included in Interest
expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the
year ended December 31, 2002.

Debt Covenants and Restrictions
The Companys debt obligations
contain certain financial and other covenants and restrictions on the Company.
Certain of the financial covenants include credit ratios such as leverage,
interest coverage and fixed charges coverage. However, such covenants do
not include any triggers explicitly tied to the Companys credit ratings
or stock price. The Company is in compliance with all such covenants and
restrictions as of December 31, 2003.
The Credit Facility does provide,
however, that all outstanding balances will become due and payable at such
time as Hearsts and certain of its affiliates equity ownership
in the Company becomes less than 35% of the total equity of the Company
and Hearst and such affiliates no longer have the right to elect a majority
of the members of the Companys Board of Directors.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company is not involved
in any derivative financial instruments. However, the Company may consider
certain interest rate risk strategies in the future. The Company may also
consider in the future certain interest rate swap arrangements or debt-for-debt
exchanges.

7. Note Payable to Capital Trust
On December 20, 2001, the Companys
wholly-owned unconsolidated subsidiary trust the Capital Trust
completed a $2000 million private placement with institutional investors.
The parent company, Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc., then issued subordinated
debentures of $2062 million the Subordinated Debentures to
the Capital Trust in exchange for $2000 million in net proceeds from the
private placement and 100% of the Capital Trusts common stock, valued
at $62 million. The Subordinated Debentures are presented as Note payable
to Capital Trust in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. See
Note 2 under New Accounting Pronouncements for a discussion
of de-consolidation of the Capital Trust, pursuant to FIN 46R. The Company
paid the Capital Trusts issuance costs of $52 million, resulting
in net proceeds to the Company of $1948 million. The Company utilized the
net proceeds to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility.
In connection with the private
placement, the Capital Trust issued 1,400,000 shares of Series A Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Securities due 2016 liquidation preference $50 per
redeemable convertible preferred security for an aggregate of $70,000,000,
and 2,600,000 shares of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities
due 2021 liquidation preference $50 per redeemable convertible preferred
security for an aggregate of $130,000,000, to institutional investors.
Hereafter, the Series A and the Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Securities are together referred to as the Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities. The investor group included Hearst Broadcasting,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hearst. Hearst Broadcasting, Inc. purchased
an aggregate of 300,000 shares of the Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Securities and an aggregate of 500,000 shares of the Series B Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Securities for a total of $40 million, or 20% of the
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities. Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc.,
the parent company of the Capital Trust, has made a full and unconditional
guarantee of the Capital Trusts payments on the Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities. See Note 15.
As part of the transaction,
the Company issued and sold to the Capital Trust, in exchange for the proceeds
from the sale of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities, $72,164,960
in aggregate principal amount of 75% convertible junior subordinated deferrable
interest debentures Series A, due 2016 the Series A Subordinated
Debentures and $134,020,640 in aggregate principal amount of 75%
convertible junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures Series B,
due 2021 the Series B Subordinated Debentures. Hereafter,
the Series A and the Series B Subordinated Debentures are together referred
to as the Subordinated Debentures.The Subordinated Debentures
issued to the Capital Trust by the parent company, Hearst-Argyle Television,
Inc., in the combined aggregate principal amount of $206,185,600 were issued
in exchange for i the receipt of the proceeds of $2000 million from the
issuance of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities; and ii $6,185,600
which was owed by the parent company to the Capital Trust for its purchase
of $6,185,600 of the Capital Trusts common stock, as part of the initial
capitalization of the Capital Trust see Note 3.
The Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities issued by the Capital Trust are effectively convertible,
at the option of the holder at any time, into shares of the Companys
Series A Common Stock, par value $0l per share through an exchange of such
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities for a portion of the Subordinated
Debentures of the corresponding series held by the Capital Trust. The conversion
terms are identical for all holders of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Securities, including Hearst. The Series A Subordinated Debentures are convertible
into the Companys Common Stock at an initial rate of 2005133 shares
of the Companys Common Stock per $50 principal amount of Series A
Subordinated Debentures equivalent to a conversion price of $249360 per
share of the Companys Common Stock and the Series B Subordinated
Debentures are convertible into the Companys Common Stock at an initial
rate of 1972262 shares of the Companys Common Stock per $50
54
HEARST-ARGYLE TELEVISION, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
principal amount of Series B Subordinated Debentures equivalent
to a conversion price of $253516 per share of the Companys Common
Stock. When the Subordinated Debentures are repaid or redeemed, the same
amount of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities will simultaneously
be redeemed with the proceeds from the repayment or redemption of the Subordinated
Debentures. The Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities mature
on December 31, 2016 with distributions payable thereon at a rate of 75%
per year. The Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities mature
on December 31, 2021 with distributions payable thereon at a rate of 75%
per year.
The Series A Subordinated Debentures
mature on December 31, 2016 and bear interest at a rate of 75% per year.
The Series B Subordinated Debentures mature on December 31, 2021 and bear
interest at a rate of 75% per year. The Company has the right to defer
interest on the Subordinated Debentures and therefore distributions on
the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities by extending the interest
payment period from time to time in accordance with and subject to the terms
of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities. Further, the Series
A Subordinated Debentures may be redeemed at the option of the Company or
at the direction of Hearst at any time on or after December 31, 2004 and
the Series B Subordinated Debentures may be redeemed at the option of the
Company or at the direction of Hearst at any time on or after December
31, 2006. The redemption prices per $50 principal amount of the Series

in 2011 and $50 thereafter to maturity. The redemption prices per $50 principal
amount of the Series B Subordinated Debentures range from $51875 in 2007,
declining to $50375 in 2011 and $50 thereafter to maturity.
Interest Expense, net Capital Trust
Interest expense, net 
Capital Trust was $150 million, $150 million and $05 million, respectively,
in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Interest expense, net
Capital Trust represents interest expense incurred by the Company
on the $2062 million of Subordinated Debentures issued by its wholly-owned
unconsolidated subsidiary trust the Capital Trust. Interest paid by the
Company to the Capital Trust was then utilized by the Capital Trust to make
dividend payments to the holders of the $2000 million of Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities issued by the Capital Trust in December 2001. In accordance
with FIN 46R, the Company does not consolidate the accounts of the Capital
Trust in its consolidated financial statements. The Company uses the equity
method of accounting to record the parent companys equity interest
in the earnings of the Capital Trust and accordingly has included such earnings
of $05 million, $05 million, and $002 million in Interest Expense, net

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
The deferred tax liabilities
primarily relate to differences between book and tax basis of the Companys
FCC licenses. In accordance with the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1,
2002, the Company no longer amortizes its FCC licenses, but instead tests
them for impairment annually. As the tax basis in the Companys FCC
licenses continues to amortize, the deferred tax liabilities will increase
over time.
The Company has net operating
loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $4376
million, of which approximately $2161 million expire between 2004 and 2014
and approximately $2215 million expire between 2015 and 2023. The valuation
allowance is the result of an evaluation of the uncertainty associated with
the realization of these net operating loss carryforwards.

Transaction, the Companys Certificate of Incorporation was amended
and restated pursuant to which, among other things, i the Companys
authorized common stock, par value $01 per share, was increased from 50
million to 200 million shares 100 million shares designated as Series A
Common Stock and 100 million shares designated as Series B Common Stock;
ii Series B Common Stock was authorized and thereafter 413 million shares
were issued to Hearst in connection with the transaction; and, iii the
Companys existing Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock received voting rights.
On March 17, 1999, the Company
amended and restated the Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number
of authorized shares of Series A Common Stock from 100 million to 200 million,
increasing the Companys total authorized shares of common stock to
300 million. Except as otherwise described below, the issued and outstanding
shares of Series A Common Stock and Series B Common Stock vote together
as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, with
each issued and outstanding share of Series A Common Stock and Series B
Common Stock entitling the holder thereof to one vote on all such matters.
With respect to any election of directors, i the holders of the shares
of Series A Common Stock are entitled to vote separately as a class to elect
two members of the Companys Board of Directors the Series A Directors
and ii the holders of the shares of the Companys Series B Common
Stock are entitled to vote separately as a class to elect the balance of
the Companys Board of Directors the Series B Directors; provided,
however, that the number of Series B Directors shall not constitute less
than a majority of the Companys Board of Directors.
All of the outstanding shares
of Series B Common Stock are held by a subsidiary of Hearst. No holder of
shares of Series B Common Stock may transfer any such shares to any person
other than to i Hearst; ii any corporation into which Hearst is merged
or consolidated or to which all, or substantially all, of Hearsts
assets are transferred; or, iii any entity controlled or consolidated
or to which all or substantially all of Hearsts assets are transferred;
or, iv any entity controlled by Hearst each a Permitted Transferee.
Series B Common Stock, however, may be converted at any time into Series
A Common Stock and freely transferred, subject to the terms and conditions
of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and to applicable securities
laws limitations.
In May 2001, the Companys
stockholders and Board of Directors approved the amendment and restatement
of the Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan.
The amendment increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under
the Stock Option Plan to 87 million shares of the Companys Series

In May 1998, the Companys
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of its
outstanding Series A Common Stock. Such repurchases may be effected from
time to time in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market
conditions and managements discretion. Between May 1998 and December
31, 2003, the Company has spent approximately $807 million to repurchase
approximately 32 million shares of Series A Common Stock at an average
price of $2524. There can be no assurance that such repurchases will occur
in the future or, if they do occur, what the terms of such repurchases will
be.
Hearst has also notified the
Company and the Securities and Exchange Commission of its intention to purchase
up to 20 million shares of the Companys Series A Common Stock from
time to time in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise. As
of December 31, 2003, Hearst had purchased approximately 193 million shares

in the Company was 654% and 656% as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
On December 3, 2003, the Companys
Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of $006
per share on the Companys Series A and Series B Common Stock in the
amount of $56 million. Included in this amount was $36 million payable

As of December 31, 2003, the
Company has reserved 613,338 shares of Series A Common Stock for future
grants under the Stock Option Plan.
The Company accounts for employee
stock-based compensation under APB 25 and related interpretations. Under
APB 25, because the exercise price of the Companys employee stock
options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant,
no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding
net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS 123 and has been determined
as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the
fair value method of SFAS 123. Under SFAS 123, options are valued at their
date of grant and then expensed over their vesting period. The fair value
of the Companys options was estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model for options granted in 2003, 2002 and
2001. The weighted average fair value of options granted was $871, $873
and $818 and 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The following assumptions
were used for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:

The Black-Scholes option valuation
model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options,
which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions
including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Companys
employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from
those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect
60
HEARST-ARGYLE TELEVISION, INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the
existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of
the fair value of its employee stock options.
See Note 2 under Stock-Based
Compensation for the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per
share had compensation expense been recorded based on the fair value method
under SFAS 123, as amended.
13. Stock Purchase Plan
In April 1999, the Company
implemented a non-compensatory employee stock purchase plan ESPP
in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 423. The ESPP allows employees
to purchase shares of the Companys Series A Common Stock, at 85% of
its market price, through after-tax payroll deductions. The Company reserved
and made available for issuance and purchases under the Stock Purchase Plan
5,000,000 shares of Series A Common Stock. Employees purchased 94,020 and
80,123 shares for aggregate proceeds of approximately $19 million and $16
million in the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
14. Related Party Transactions

As of December 31, 2003, Hearst owned approximately 376% of the Companys
Series A common stock and 100% of the Companys Series B common stock,
representing in the aggregate approximately 654% of the outstanding voting
power of the Companys common stock, except with regard to the election
of directors. With regard to the election of directors, Hearsts ownership
of the Companys Series B common stock entitles Hearst to elect 11
of the 13 directors of the Companys Board of Directors. During the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company entered into the
following transactions with Hearst or parties related to Hearst:

that more favorable terms would not be available from third parties.
Services Agreement. The Company
incurred expenses of approximately $37 million, $38 million and $39 million
in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, relating

$30 million, $30 million and $01 million in the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, to Hearst, since Hearst holds $40
million of the total $200 million Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities

From time to time, the Company
becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its
business. In the opinion of the Company, there are no legal proceedings
pending against the Company or any of its subsidiaries that are likely to
have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial
condition or results of operations.
The Company has guaranteed
the payments by its wholly-owned unconsolidated subsidiary trust the Capital
Trust on the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities in the amount
of $2000 million. See Note 7. The guarantee is irrevocable and unconditional,
and guarantees the payment in full of all i distributions on the Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Securities to the extent of available funds of the
Capital Trust; ii amounts payable upon redemption of the Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities to the extent of available funds of the Capital Trust;
and iii amounts payable upon a dissolution of the Capital Trust. The guarantee
is unsecured and ranks i subordinate to all other liabilities of the Company,
except liabilities that are expressly made pari passu; ii pari
passu with the most senior preferred stock issued by the Company, and
pari passu with any guarantee of the Company in respect of any preferred
stock of the Company or any preferred security of any of the Companys

16. Retirement Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits
Overview
The Company maintains seven
defined benefit pension plans, 12 employee savings plans, and other post-retirement
benefit plans for active, retired and former employees. In addition, the
Company participates in a multi-employer union pension plan that provides
retirement benefits to certain union employees. The seven defined benefit
pension plans are hereafter collectively referred to as the Pension
Plans.
Pension Plans and Other
Post-Retirement Benefits
Benefits under the Pension
Plans are generally based on years of credited service, age at retirement
and average of the highest five consecutive years compensation. The
cost of the Pension Plans is computed on the basis of the Project Unit Credit
Actuarial Cost Method. Past service cost is amortized over the expected
future service periods of the employees.
Pension Plan
Assets
The Pension Plans weighted
average asset allocations as of the measurement dates September 30, 2003
and 2002, by asset category, are as follows:

The assets of the Pension Plans
are invested with the objective of being able to meet current and future
benefit payment needs, while controlling pension expense volatility. Plan
assets are invested with a number of investment managers and are diversified
among equities, fixed income, real estate and other investments, as shown
in the table above. Approximately 80% of the assets of the Pension Plans
are invested in a master trust, which has a target allocation of approximately
70% equities and 30% fixed income. When adding the remaining 20% of the
assets of the Pension Plans which are outside of the master trust, the aggregate
target allocation is comparable to that of the master trust, but with a
slightly higher target allocation percentage for fixed income investments
approximately 68% equities and 32% fixed income. Each of the Pension Plans
employs active investment management programs, and each has an Investment
Committee which reviews the respective plans asset allocation on a
periodic basis and determines when and how to re-balance the portfolio when
appropriate. None of the Pension Plans has any dedicated target allocation
to the Companys Common Stock.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
To develop the expected long-term
rate of return on assets assumptions, the Company considered the current
level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government
bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other
asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for
future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class
was then weighted based on the aggregate target asset allocation to develop
the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The expected rate of return assumption is then adjusted to reflect investment
and trading expenses. Since the Companys investment policy is to actively
manage certain asset classes where the potential exists to outperform the
broader market, the expected returns for those asset classes were adjusted
to reflect the expected additional returns. The Company reviews the expected
long-term rate of return on an annual basis and revises it as appropriate.
The weighted-average assumptions
used for computing the projected benefit obligation for the Companys
post-retirement benefit plan as of the measurement dates of September 30,
2003 and 2002 are as follows:
Post-Retirement

For measurement purposes, in
determining the per capita cost of covered health care benefits, the Company
assumed annual rates of increase of 9% to 10% for employees under age 65.
These rates are assumed to decrease gradually to 5% by 2010 and remain at
that level thereafter. For employees age 65 and over, the Company assumed
annual rates of increase of 12%, decreasing gradually to 5% by 2013 and
remaining at that level thereafter.
The assumed health care cost
trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health
care plan. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend
rates would have the following effects:

Savings Plans
The Companys qualified
employees may contribute from 2% to 16% of their compensation up to certain
dollar limits to self-directed 401k savings plans. In certain 401k savings
plans, the Company matches in cash, one-half of the employee contribution
up to 6% of the employees compensation. The assets in the 401k savings
plans are invested in a variety of diversified mutual funds. The Company
contributions to the 401k savings plans in the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $24 million, $24 million and $21
million, respectively.
Multi-Employer Pension Plan
The Company participates in
a multi-employer pension plan for providing retirement benefits to certain
union employees. The Companys contributions to the multiemployer union
pension plan in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were approximately
$07 million each year. No information is available for each of the other
contributing employers for this plan.

The fair values of the Senior
Notes were determined based on the quoted market prices. The fair values
of the Credit Facility, the Private Placement Debt, and the Note Payable
to Capital Trust were determined using discounted cash flow models.
For instruments including cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other debt
the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity
of these instruments. In accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 107,
Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, the Company
believes it is not practicable to estimate the current fair value of the
related party receivables and related party payables because of the related
party nature of the transactions.

Per common share amounts for the quarters and
the full years have each been calculated separately. Accordingly, quarterly
amounts may not add to the annual amounts because of differences in the
average common shares outstanding during each period and, with regard to
diluted per common share amounts only, because of the inclusion of the effect
of potentially dilutive securities only in the periods in which such effect
would have been dilutive.
19. Subsequent Event
On January 23, 2004, the Company
entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with WMTW Broadcast Group, LLC
to acquire WMTW-TV, Channel 8, the ABC affiliate serving the Portland-Auburn,
Maine television market, for $375 million in cash. The transaction is conditioned
on approval by the Federal Communications Commission and other customary
closing conditions, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2004.
