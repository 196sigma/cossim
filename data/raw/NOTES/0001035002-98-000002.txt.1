ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Valero Energy Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 
Valero Energy Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of 
income, common stock and other stockholders' equity and cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements 
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Valero Energy 
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. RESTRUCTURING
In the discussion below and Notes that follow, the Company refers to 
Valero Energy Corporation Valero and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
Valero was formerly known as Valero Refining and Marketing Company prior to 
the Restructuring described below. Upon completion of the Restructuring, 
Valero Refining and Marketing Company was renamed Valero Energy Corporation.
Energy refers to Valero Energy Corporation and its consolidated 
subsidiaries, both individually and collectively, for periods prior to the 
Restructuring, and to the natural gas related services business of Energy for
periods subsequent to the Restructuring.
On July 31, 1997, pursuant to an agreement and plan of distribution 
between Energy and Valero the Distribution Agreement, Energy spun off 
Valero to Energy stockholders by distributing all of Valero $01 par 
value common stock Common Stock on a share for share basis to holders 
of record of Energy common stock at the close of business on such date 
the Distribution. Immediately after the Distribution, Energy merged 
its natural gas related services business with a wholly owned subsidiary 
of PG Corporation PG the Merger. The Distribution and the 
Merger collectively referred to as the Restructuring were approved by 
Energy stockholders at Energy annual meeting of stockholders held on 
June 18, 1997 and, in the opinion of Energy outside counsel, were tax-free
transactions. Regulatory approval of the Merger was received from the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the FERC on July 16, 1997. Upon 
completion of the Restructuring, Valero Refining and Marketing Company was
renamed Valero Energy Corporation and is listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange under the symbol VLO.
Immediately prior to the Distribution, the Company paid to Energy a 
$210 million dividend pursuant to the Distribution Agreement. In addition, 
the Company paid to Energy approximately $5 million in settlement of the 
intercompany note balance between the Company and Energy arising from certain
transactions during the period from January 1 through July 31, 1997.
In connection with the Merger, PG issued approximately 31 million 
shares of its common stock in exchange for the outstanding $1 par value 
common shares of Energy, and assumed $7857 million of Energy debt. 
Each Energy stockholder received 554 of a share of PG common stock 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PCG for each 
Energy share owned. This fractional share amount was based on the average 
price of PG common stock during a prescribed period preceding the closing 
of the transaction and the number of Energy shares issued and outstanding at 
the time of the closing.
Prior to the Restructuring, Energy, Valero, and PG entered into a tax 
sharing agreement Tax Sharing Agreement, which sets forth each party 
rights and obligations with respect to payments and refunds, if any, of 
federal, state, local or other taxes for periods before the Restructuring. 
In general, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Energy and Valero are each 
responsible for its allocable share of the federal, state and other taxes 
incurred by the combined operations of Energy and Valero prior to the 
Distribution. Furthermore, Valero is responsible for substantially all tax 
liability resulting from the failure of the Distribution or the Merger to 
qualify as a tax-free transaction, except that Energy will be responsible 
for any such tax liability attributable to certain actions taken by Energy 
and/or PG
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
Prior to the Restructuring, Valero was a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Energy. For financial reporting purposes under the federal securities laws, 
Valero is a successor registrant to Energy. As a result, for periods 
prior to the Restructuring, the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements include the accounts of Energy restated to reflect Energy 
natural gas related services business as discontinued operations. For 
periods subsequent to the Restructuring, the accompanying consolidated 
financial statements include the accounts of Valero and its consolidated 
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been 
eliminated in consolidation. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenues generally are recorded when products have been delivered.
Price Risk Management Activities
The Company enters into price swaps, options and futures contracts with 
third parties to hedge refinery feedstock purchases and refined product 
inventories in order to reduce the impact of adverse price changes on these 
inventories before the conversion of the feedstock to finished products and 
ultimate sale. Hedges of inventories are accounted for under the deferral 
method with gains and losses included in the carrying amounts of inventories
and ultimately recognized in cost of sales as those inventories are sold.
The Company also hedges anticipated transactions. Price swaps, options 
and futures contracts with third parties are used to hedge feedstock and 
product purchases, product sales and refining operating margins by locking 
in purchase or sales prices or components of the margins, including feedstock
discounts, the conventional crack spread and premium product differentials. 
Hedges of anticipated transactions are also accounted for under the deferral 
method with gains and losses on these transactions recognized in cost of 
sales when the hedged transaction occurs.
The above noted contracts are designated at inception as a hedge when 
there is a direct relationship to the price risk associated with the 
Company inventories, future purchases and sales of commodities used in
the Company operations, or components of the Company refining operating 
margins. If such direct relationship ceases to exist, the related contract 
is designated for trading purposes and accounted for as described below.
Gains and losses on early terminations of financial instrument contracts
designated as hedges are deferred and included in cost of sales in the 
measurement of the hedged transaction. When an anticipated transaction being 
hedged is no longer likely to occur, the related derivative contract is 
accounted for similar to a contract entered into for trading purposes.
The Company also enters into price swaps, options, and futures contracts 
with third parties for trading purposes using its fundamental and technical 
analysis of market conditions to earn additional revenues. Contracts entered
into for trading purposes are accounted for under the fair value method. 
Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized as gains or 
losses in cost of sales currently and are recorded in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets in Prepaid expenses and other and Accounts payable at 
fair value at the reporting date. The Company determines the fair value 
of its exchange-traded contracts based on the settlement prices for open 
contracts, which are established by the exchange on which the instruments 
are traded. The fair value of the Company over-the-counter contracts is 
determined based on market-related indexes or by obtaining quotes from 
brokers.
The Company derivative contracts and their related gains and losses 
are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements 
of Income as discussed above, depending on whether they are designated as a 
hedge or for trading purposes. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash 
Flows, cash transactions related to derivative contracts are included in 
changes in current assets and current liabilities.
Inventories
Refinery feedstocks and refined products and blendstocks are carried 
at the lower of cost or market, with the cost of feedstocks purchased for 
processing and produced products determined primarily under the last-in, 
first-out LIFO method of inventory pricing and the cost of feedstocks 
and products purchased for resale determined primarily under the weighted 
average cost method. The replacement cost of the Company LIFO inventories 
approximated their LIFO values at December 31, 1997. Materials and supplies
are carried principally at weighted average cost not in excess of market. 
Inventories as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 were as follows in thousands 
December 31,
1997      1996   
Refinery feedstocks          $102,677     $ 42,744 
Refined products and blendstocks    210,196      99,398 
Materials and supplies          56,482      17,729 
$369,355     $159,871    Refinery feedstock and refined product and blendstock inventory volumes 
totaled 157 million barrels MMbbls and 74 MMbbls as of December 31, 
1997 and 1996, respectively. See Note 7 for information concerning the 
Company hedging activities related to its refinery feedstock purchases 
and refined product inventories.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property additions and betterments include capitalized interest and 
acquisition costs allocable to construction and property purchases.
The costs of minor property units or components of property units, 
net of salvage, retired or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated 
depreciation under the composite method of depreciation. Gains or losses
on sales or other dispositions of major units of property are credited or 
charged to income.
Major classes of property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 1997 
and 1996 were as follows in thousands:
December 31,      
1997      1996    
Crude oil processing facilities      $1,522,409   $1,329,386 
Butane processing facilities         351,594    233,457 
Other processing facilities          80,197     80,000 
Other                     111,653     47,763 
Construction in progress            66,636     21,728 
$2,132,489   $1,712,334 
Provision for depreciation of property, plant and equipment is made 
primarily on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the 
depreciable facilities. During 1996, a detailed study of the Company 
fixed asset lives was completed by a third-party consultant for the 
majority of the Company then-existing processing facilities. As a 
result of such study, the Company adjusted the weighted-average 
remaining lives of the assets subject to the study, utilizing the 
composite method of depreciation, to better reflect the estimated periods 
during which such assets are expected to remain in service. The effect of 
this change in accounting estimate was an increase in income from continuing
operations for 1996 of approximately $36 million, or $08 per share. A 
summary of the principal rates used in computing the annual provision for 
depreciation, primarily utilizing the composite method and including 
estimated salvage values, is as follows                               Weighted
Range      Average 
Crude oil processing facilities   36% - 49%    46%

Other processing facilities         36%    36% 
Other               225% - 45%    225%  Deferred Charges and Other Assets
Catalyst and Refinery Turnaround Costs
Catalyst costs are deferred when incurred and amortized over the 
estimated useful life of that catalyst, normally one to three years. 
Refinery turnaround costs are deferred when incurred and amortized over 
that period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs.
Technological Royalties and Licenses
Technological royalties and licenses are deferred when incurred and 
amortized over the estimated useful life of each particular royalty or 
license.
Other Deferred Charges and Other Assets
Other deferred charges and other assets include the Company 20% 
interest in Javelina Company Javelina, a general partnership that 
owns a refinery off-gas processing plant in Corpus Christi. The Company 
accounts for its interest in Javelina on the equity method of accounting. 
Also included in other deferred charges and other assets are prefunded 
benefit costs and certain other costs.
Accrued Expenses  
Accrued expenses as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 were as 
follows in thousands:
December 31,
1997    1996
Accrued interest expense              $ 1,766   $ 5,088
Accrued taxes                    36,712    11,938

$60,979   $25,264
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments approximate 
fair value, except for certain long-term debt as of December 31, 1996 and 
financial instruments used in price risk management activities. See Notes 6 
and 7.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using 
the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, 
and related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock 
options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of 
the Company common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an 
employee must pay to acquire the stock. Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, 
issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB in October 
1995, encourages, but does not require companies to measure and recognize 
in their financial statements a compensation cost for stock-based employee 
compensation plans based on the fair value method of accounting set forth 
in the statement. See Note 13 for the pro forma effects on net income and 
earnings per share had compensation cost for the Company stock-based 
compensation plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123.
Earnings Per Share
In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, 
which became effective for the Company financial statements beginning 
with the period ending December 31, 1997. This statement supersedes APB 
Opinion No. 15, Earnings per Share, and related interpretations and 
establishes new standards for computing and presenting earnings per share, 
requiring a dual presentation for companies with complex capital structures.
In accordance with this new statement, the Company has presented basic 
and diluted earnings per share on the face of the accompanying income 
statements. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income 
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common 
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects 
the potential dilution of the Company Convertible Preferred Stock 
see Note 9 and outstanding stock options and performance awards granted 
to employees in connection with the Company stock compensation plans 
see Note 13. In determining basic earnings per share for the years 
ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, dividends on Energy preferred 
stock were deducted from income from discontinued operations as such 
preferred stock was issued in connection with Energy natural gas related 
services business. The weighted average number of common shares 
outstanding for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 was 
51,662,449, 43,926,026 and 43,651,914, respectively.
A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and 
diluted per-share computations for income from continuing operations is as 
follows dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts:

Statements of Cash Flows
In order to determine net cash provided by continuing operations, income 
from continuing operations has been adjusted by, among other things, changes 
in current assets and current liabilities, excluding changes in cash and 
temporary cash investments, current deferred income tax assets, short-term 
debt and current maturities of long-term debt. The changes in the Company 
current assets and current liabilities, excluding the items noted above, are 
shown in the following table as an increase/decrease in current assets and 
an increase/decrease in current liabilities. The Company temporary cash 
investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments which have a 
maturity of three months or less when acquired. Dollars in thousands.                       Year Ended December 31,

Income taxes               24,526   19,043  23,935   
Noncash investing and financing activities for 1997 included the 
issuance of Energy common stock to Salomon Inc Salomon as partial 
consideration for the acquisition of the stock of Basis Petroleum, Inc. 
Basis, and an $183 million accrual as of December 31, 1997 related 
to the Company estimate of a contingent earn-out payment in 1998 in 
conjunction with such acquisition. See Note 4. In addition, noncash 
investing and financing activities for 1997 included various adjustments 
to debt and equity, including the assumption of certain debt by PG that 
was previously allocated to the Company, resulting from the Merger discussed 
in Note 1.
New Accounting Standards
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive 
Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of 
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose 
financial statements and requires that all items that are required to be 
recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income 
be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same 
prominence as other financial statements. This statement requires that 
an enterprise classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature 
in a financial statement and display the accumulated balance of other 
comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional 
paid-in capital in the equity section of a statement of financial position.
Reclassification of prior period financial statements presented for 
comparative purposes is required. This statement becomes effective for 
the Company financial statements beginning in 1998 and requires that 
a total for comprehensive income be reported in interim period financial 
statements issued to shareholders. Based on current accounting standards, 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to impact the Company 
consolidated financial statements.
Also in June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about 
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 
establishes new standards for reporting information about operating 
segments in annual financial statements and requires selected operating 
segment information to be reported in interim financial reports issued to 
shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about 
products and services, geographic areas and major customers. This statement 
becomes effective for the Company financial statements beginning with the 
year ended December 31, 1998 at which time restatement of prior period 
segment information presented for comparative purposes is required. 
Interim period information is not required until the second year of 
application, at which time comparative information is required. The 
adoption of this statement is not expected to impact the Company 
consolidated financial statement disclosures.
In February 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132, Employers' Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. SFAS No. 132 standardizes
the disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
to the extent practicable, requires additional information on changes in 
the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets, and eliminates 
certain disclosures that are no longer useful. This statement becomes 
effective for the Company financial statement disclosures beginning in 
1998 and requires restatement of prior period disclosures presented for 
comparative purposes unless the information is not readily available.
The FASB had previously issued in February 1997 SFAS No. 128, Earnings 
per Share, discussed above and SFAS No. 129, Disclosure of Information 
about Capital Structure, both of which became effective for the Company 
financial statements beginning with the period ending December 31, 1997. 
As the purpose of SFAS No. 129 was primarily to consolidate certain disclosure 
requirements previously contained in other pronouncements with which the 
Company was already in compliance, the adoption of this statement had no 
effect on the Company accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Energy historical practice was to utilize a centralized cash management 
system and to incur certain indebtedness for its consolidated group at the 
parent company level rather than at the operating subsidiary level. 
Therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect, for 
periods prior to the Restructuring, the allocation of a portion of the 
borrowings under Energy various bank credit facilities, as well as a 
portion of other corporate debt of Energy, to the discontinued natural gas 
related services business based upon the ratio of such business' net assets, 
excluding the amounts of intercompany notes receivable or payable, to 
Energy consolidated net assets. Interest expense related to corporate 
debt was also allocated to the discontinued natural gas related services 
business for periods prior to the Restructuring based on the same net asset 
ratio. Total interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in the 
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income, including a portion of 
interest on corporate debt allocated pursuant to the methodology described 
above plus interest specifically attributed to discontinued operations, 
was $327 million for the seven months ended July 31, 1997, and
$581 million and $609 million for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 
1995, respectively.
Revenues of the discontinued natural gas related services business were 
$17 billion for the seven months ended July 31, 1997, and $24 billion and 
$14 billion for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. 
These amounts are not included in operating revenues as reported in the 
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
4. ACQUISITION OF BASIS PETROLEUM, INC.
Effective May 1, 1997, Energy acquired the outstanding common stock of 
Basis, a wholly owned subsidiary of Salomon. Prior to the Restructuring, 
Energy transferred the stock of Basis to Valero. As a result, Basis was a 
part of the Company at the time it was spun off to Energy stockholders 
pursuant to the Restructuring. The primary assets acquired in the Basis 
acquisition included petroleum refineries located in Texas at Texas City 
and Houston and in Louisiana at Krotz Springs, and an extensive wholesale 
marketing business. The acquisition has been accounted for using the 
purchase method of accounting and the purchase price was allocated to 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values,
pending the completion of an independent appraisal. The accompanying 
Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company include the results of 
the operations acquired in connection with the purchase of Basis for 
the months of May through December 1997.
Energy acquired the stock of Basis for approximately $470 million. 
This amount includes certain costs incurred in connection with the 
acquisition and is net of $95 million received from Salomon in 
December 1997 representing a final resolution between the parties relating 
to certain contingent environmental obligations for which Salomon was 
liable pursuant to the purchase agreement. The purchase price was paid, 
in part, with 3,429,796 shares of Energy common stock having a fair market 
value of $114 million, with the remainder paid in cash from borrowings 
under Energy bank credit facilities see Note 6. Pursuant to the 
purchase agreement, Salomon is also entitled to receive payments in 
any of the next 10 years if certain average refining margins during any of 
such years exceed a specified level. Any payments under this earn-out 
arrangement, which will be determined as of May 1 of each year beginning 
in 1998, are limited to $35 million in any year and $200 million in the 
aggregate and will be accounted for by the Company as an additional cost 
of the acquisition and depreciated over the remaining lives of the assets 
to which the additional cost is allocated. As of December 31, 1997, the 
Company accrued $183 million related to its estimate of the contingent
earn-out payment due in 1998. 
The following unaudited pro forma financial information of the Company 
assumes that the acquisition of Basis occurred at the beginning of each 
period presented. Such pro forma information is not necessarily indicative 
of the results of future operations. Dollars in thousands, except per share 
amounts.

5. SHORT-TERM DEBT 
The Company currently maintains seven separate short-term bank credit 
facilities under which amounts ranging from $160 million to $435 million 
may be borrowed. As of December 31, 1997, $122 million was outstanding 
under these short-term bank credit facilities at a weighted average 
interest rate of approximately 77%. Four of these credit facilities 
are cancelable on demand, and the others expire at various times in 1998. 
These short-term credit facilities bear interest at each respective bank 
quoted money market rate, have no commitment or other fees or compensating 
balance requirements and are unsecured and unrestricted as to use.
6. LONG-TERM DEBT AND BANK CREDIT FACILITIES
Long-term debt balances as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 were as

$ 430,183   $ 353,307 
Effective May 1, 1997, Energy replaced its existing unsecured 
$300 million revolving bank credit and letter of credit facility with a 
new five-year, unsecured $835 million revolving bank credit and letter 
of credit facility. The new credit facility was used to finance a portion 
of the acquisition cost of Basis see Note 4 and to fund a $210 million 
dividend paid by the Company to Energy immediately prior to the Distribution
see Note 1. The facility also provides continuing credit enhancement for 
the Company Refunding Bonds and Revenue Bonds as discussed below, and can 
be used to provide financing for other general corporate purposes. Energy 
was the borrower under the facility until the completion of the Restructuring
on July 31, 1997, at which time all obligations of Energy under the facility 
were assumed by the Company. In November 1997, the facility was amended to 
further enhance the Company financial flexibility. Among other things, 
the amendment extended the maturity to November 2002, eliminated provisions 
restricting availability under the facility, and eliminated several 
restrictive covenants.
Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either LIBOR plus 
a margin, a base rate, or a money market rate. In addition, various fees 
and expenses are required to be paid in connection with the credit facility, 
including a facility fee, a letter of credit issuance fee and a fee based on 
letters of credit outstanding. The interest rate and fees under the credit 
facility are subject to adjustment based upon the credit ratings assigned to 
the Company long-term debt. The credit facility includes certain 
restrictive covenants including a coverage ratio, a capitalization ratio, 
and a minimum net worth test. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had 
approximately $558 million available under this revolving bank credit 
facility for additional borrowings and letters of credit. The Company 
also has several uncommitted bank letter of credit facilities. As of 
December 31, 1997, such facilities totaled $305 million of which 
approximately $73 million was outstanding.
In April 1997, the Industrial Development Corporation of the Port of 
Corpus Christi issued and sold, for the benefit of the Company, 
$985 million of tax-exempt Revenue Refunding Bonds the Refunding Bonds, 
with credit enhancement provided through a letter of credit issued under the 
revolving bank credit facility described above. The Refunding Bonds were 
issued in four series with due dates ranging from 2009 to 2027. The 
Refunding Bonds bear interest at variable rates determined weekly, with 
the Company having the right to convert such rates to a daily, weekly or 
commercial paper rate, or to a fixed rate. The Refunding Bonds were issued 
to refund the Company $985 million principal amount of tax-exempt bonds 
which were issued in 1987. In May 1997, the Gulf Coast Industrial 
Development Authority issued and sold, for the benefit of the Company, 
$25 million of new Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds the Revenue Bonds 
which mature on December 1, 2031, with credit enhancement provided through 
a letter of credit issued under the Company revolving bank credit 
facility. Other terms and conditions of these bonds are similar to those 
of the Refunding Bonds. In January 1998, the Company Board of Directors 
approved the commencement of efforts to convert the interest rates on the 
Refunding Bonds and Revenue Bonds from variable rates to fixed rates. At 
the same time, the Board approved the issuance of an additional $25 million 
of tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds at a fixed interest rate and the 
issuance of up to $435 million of taxable industrial revenue bonds at 
variable interest rates, both of which are expected to mature in the 
year 2032. The $435 million of variable rate bonds will be supported 
by a letter of credit issued under the Company revolving bank credit 
facility. The above noted letters of credit associated with the 
$1235 million of outstanding Refunding Bonds and Revenue Bonds will be 
released upon conversion of the interest rates from variable to fixed. 
The interest rate conversion of the outstanding bonds and the issuance 
of the new bonds are expected to be completed by the end of the first 
quarter of 1998.
In December 1997, the Company issued $150 million principal amount of 
675% notes the Notes for net proceeds of approximately $156 million. 
The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated and rank equally with all other 
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company. The Notes were 
issued to the Valero Pass-Through Asset Trust 1997-1 the Trust, which 
funded the acquisition of the Notes through a private placement of 
$150 million principal amount of 675% Pass-Through Asset Trust Securities
PATS. The PATS represent a fractional undivided beneficial interest in 
the Trust. In exchange for certain consideration paid to the Trust, a third 
party has an option to purchase the Notes under certain circumstances at par 
on December 15, 2002, at which time the term of the Notes would be extended 
30 years to December 15, 2032. If the third party does not exercise its 
purchase option, then under the terms of the Notes, the Company would be 
required to repurchase the Notes at par on December 15, 2002.
The Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in its 
various debt facilities as of December 31, 1997.
Based on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1997, the Company 
has no maturities of long-term debt during the next five years except for 
$150 million due in November 2002 under its revolving bank credit and 
letter of credit facility. See above for maturities under the terms of 
the Notes.
The carrying amounts of the Company variable-rate industrial revenue 
bonds and revolving bank credit and letter of credit facility approximate 
fair value at December 31, 1997. The carrying amount of the Company 
675% Notes also approximates fair value at December 31, 1997 due to their 
issuance on December 12, 1997. As of December 31, 1996, based on the 
borrowing rates available to the Company for long-term debt with similar 
terms and average maturities, the estimated fair value of the Company 
long-term debt, including current maturities, was $4127 million.
7. PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 
Hedging Activities
The Company uses price swaps, options and futures to hedge refinery 
feedstock purchases and refined product inventories in order to reduce the 
impact of adverse price changes on these inventories before the conversion 
of the feedstock to finished products and ultimate sale. Swaps, options 
and futures contracts held to hedge refining inventories at the end of 
1997 and 1996 had remaining terms of less than one year. As of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, 14% and 13%, respectively, of the Company 
refining inventory position was hedged. As of December 31, 1997, 
$21 million of deferred hedge gains were included as a reduction of 
refining inventories, while as of December 31, 1996, $8 million of 
deferred hedge losses were included as an increase to refining inventories. 
The following table is a summary of the volumes and range of prices for the 
Company contracts held or issued to hedge refining inventories as of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996. Volumes shown for swaps represent notional 
volumes which are used to calculate amounts due under the agreements and 
do not represent volumes exchanged.                  1997            1996

The Company also hedges anticipated transactions. Price swaps, options 
and futures are used to hedge feedstock and product purchases, product sales
and refining operating margins for periods up to five years by locking in 
purchase or sales prices or components of the margins, including the resid 
discount, the conventional crack spread and premium product differentials. 
There were no significant explicit deferrals of hedging gains or losses 
related to these anticipated transactions as of either year end. The 
following table is a summary of the volumes and range of prices for the 
Company contracts held or issued to hedge feedstock and product purchases,
product sales and refining margins as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.

Trading Activities
The Company enters into transactions for trading purposes using its 
fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions to earn additional 
revenues. The types of instruments used include price swaps, 
over-the-counter and exchange-traded options, and futures. These 
contracts run for periods of up to 12 months. As a result, contracts 
outstanding as of December 31, 1997 will mature in 1998. The following

Market and Credit Risk
The Company price risk management activities involve the receipt or 
payment of fixed price commitments into the future. These transactions give 
rise to market risk, the risk that future changes in market conditions may 
make an instrument less valuable. The Company closely monitors and manages 
its exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies 
limiting net open positions. Concentrations of customers in the refining 
industry may impact the Company overall exposure to credit risk, in that 
the customers in such industry may be similarly affected by changes in 
economic or other conditions. The Company believes that its counterparties 
will be able to satisfy their obligations under contracts.
8. REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
On March 30, 1997, Energy redeemed the remaining 11,500 outstanding 
shares of its Cumulative Preferred Stock, $850 Series A Series A 
Preferred Stock. The redemption price was $104 per share, plus dividends 
accrued to the redemption date of $685 per share.
9. CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
In April 1997, Energy called all of its outstanding $3125 convertible 
preferred stock Convertible Preferred Stock for redemption on 
June 2, 1997. The total redemption price for the Convertible Preferred 
Stock was $521966 per share representing a per-share redemption price 
of $52188, plus accrued dividends in the amount of $0086 per share for 
the one-day period from June 1, 1997 to the June 2, 1997 redemption date. 
The Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into Energy common stock at 
a conversion price of $2703 per share equivalent to a conversion rate 
of approximately 185 shares of common stock for each share of Convertible 
Preferred Stock. Prior to the redemption, substantially all of the 
outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into 
shares of Energy common stock.
10. PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS
In connection with the Distribution, the Company Board of Directors 
declared a dividend distribution of one Preferred Share Purchase Right 
Right for each outstanding share of the Company Common Stock 
distributed to Energy stockholders pursuant to the Distribution. Except 
as set forth below, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase 
from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of the Company Junior 
Participating Preferred Stock, Series I, Junior Preferred Stock at 
a price of $100 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to adjustment.
Until the earlier to occur of i 10 days following a public announcement 
that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons an Acquiring 
Person has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding 
shares of the Company Common Stock, ii 10 business days or such later date
as may be determined by action of the Company Board of Directors following 
the initiation of a tender offer or exchange offer which would result in the 
beneficial ownership by an Acquiring Person of 15% or more of such outstanding
Common Stock the earlier of such dates being called the Rights Separation 
Date, or iii the earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights, the 
Rights will be transferred only with the Common Stock. The Rights are not 
exercisable until the Rights Separation Date. At any time prior to the 
acquisition by an Acquiring Person of beneficial ownership of 15% or more 
of the outstanding Common Stock, the Company Board of Directors may 
redeem the Rights at a price of $01 per Right. The Rights will expire 
on June 30, 2007, unless such date is extended or unless the Rights are 
earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company.
In the event that after the Rights Separation Date, the Company is 
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, or if 50% 
or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, each holder 
of a Right will have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at 
the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of 
common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction 
will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. In
the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons 
becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding Common 
Stock, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the
Acquiring Person which will thereafter be void, will thereafter have the 
right to receive upon exercise that number of shares of Common Stock having 
a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. 
At any time after the acquisition by an Acquiring Person of beneficial 
ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock and prior to the 
acquisition by such Acquiring Person of 50% or more of the outstanding 
Common Stock, the Company Board of Directors may exchange the Right 
other than Rights owned by such Acquiring Person which have become void, 
at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock, or one one-hundredth of 
a share of Junior Preferred Stock, per Right subject to adjustment. 
Until a Right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a 
stockholder of the Company including, without limitation, the right to 
vote or to receive dividends. 
The Rights may have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights will 
cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire 
the Company on terms not approved by the Company Board of Directors, 
except pursuant to an offer conditioned on a substantial number of Rights 
being acquired. The Rights should not interfere with any merger or other 
business combination approved by the Company Board of Directors since 
the Rights may be redeemed by the Company prior to the time that a person 
or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Common 
Stock.
11. INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION
Subsequent to the Restructuring, the Company operates in one industry 
segment encompassing the refining and marketing of premium, environmentally 
clean products such as reformulated gasoline, CARB Phase II gasoline, 
low-sulfur diesel and oxygenates. The Company also produces a substantial 
slate of middle distillates, jet fuel and petrochemicals. The Company 
operations consist primarily of four petroleum refineries located in Texas 
at Corpus Christi, Texas City and Houston, and in Louisiana at Krotz Springs 
which have a combined throughput capacity of approximately 530,000 BPD. 
The Company also has certain marketing operations located in Houston. The 
Company currently markets its products to wholesale customers in 32 states, 
including California and other states located in the Northeast, 
Midwest, Southeast and Gulf Coast, and selected export markets in 
Latin America. In 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company had no significant 
amount of export sales and no significant foreign operations. In 1997, 
no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company 
consolidated operating revenues, while in 1996 and 1995, approximately 11% 
and 17%, respectively, of the Company consolidated operating revenues were 
derived from a major domestic oil company.

reduce future federal income tax liabilities. The AMT credit carryforward 
has no expiration date. The Company has not recorded any valuation 
allowances against deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 1997.
The Company taxable years through 1993 are closed to adjustment by 
the Internal Revenue Service. The Company believes that adequate provisions 
for income taxes have been reflected in its consolidated financial statements.
13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Pension Plans
Prior to the Restructuring, Energy maintained a defined benefit pension 
plan. Pursuant to an Employee Benefits Agreement entered into between the 
Company and Energy in connection with the Restructuring, effective at the 
time of the Distribution, the Company became the sponsor of Energy pension 
plan and became solely responsible for i pension liabilities existing 
immediately prior to the time of the Distribution to, or relating to, 
individuals employed by Energy which became employees of PG after the 
Distribution, which liabilities will become payable upon the retirement of 
such individuals, ii all liabilities to, or relating to, former employees 
of Energy and the Company, and iii all liabilities to, or relating to,
current employees of the Company. Also pursuant to the Employee Benefits 
Agreement, the Company became the sponsor of Energy nonqualified 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP, which provided additional 
pension benefits to executive officers and certain other employees, and 
assumed all liabilities with respect to current and former employees 
of both Energy and the Company under such plan.  
The Company pension plan, which is subject to the provisions of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, is designed to provide 
eligible employees with retirement income. Participation in the plan 
commences upon attaining age 21 and the completion of one year of continuous 
service. A participant vests in plan benefits after five years of vesting 
service or upon reaching normal retirement date. Employees of the Company 
who were formerly employees of Basis commenced participation in the plan 
effective January 1, 1998 under the same service requirements as required 
for other Company employees. For such employees, prior employment with 
Basis is considered in determining vesting service, but credited 
service for the accrual of benefits did not begin until January 1, 1998.
The pension plan provides a monthly pension payable upon normal 
retirement of an amount equal to a set formula which is based on the 
participant 60 consecutive highest months of compensation during the 
latest 10 years of credited service under the plan. Contributions to the 
plan by the Company, when permitted, are actuarially determined in an amount 
sufficient to fund the currently accruing benefits and amortize any prior 
service cost over the expected life of the then current work force. The 
Company contributions to the pension plan and SERP in 1997, 1996 and 1995 
were approximately $88 million, $142 million and $43 million, 
respectively, and are currently estimated to be $11 million in 1998.
In connection with the Restructuring, Energy approved the establishment 
of a supplement to the pension plan the 1997 Window Plan which permitted 
certain employees to retire from employment during 1997.
The following table sets forth for the pension plans of the Company, 
including the SERP, the funded status and amounts recognized in the

The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the actuarial 
present value of the projected benefit obligation was 7% and 725% as of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The rate of increase in 
future compensation levels used in determining the projected benefit 
obligation as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 was 4% for nonexempt personnel 
and 4% and 3%, respectively, for exempt personnel. The expected long-term 
rate of return on plan assets was 925% as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for 
retired employees, referred to herein as postretirement benefits other than 
pensions. Substantially all of the Company employees may become eligible 
for those benefits if, while still working for the Company, they either reach
normal retirement age or take early retirement. Health care benefits are 
offered by the Company through a self-insured plan and a health maintenance 
organization while life insurance benefits are provided through an insurance 
company. The Company funds its postretirement benefits other than pensions 
on a pay-as-you-go basis.  Pursuant to the Employee Benefits Agreement, 
effective at the time of the Distribution, the Company became responsible 
for all liabilities to former employees of both Energy and the Company as 
well as current employees of the Company arising under Energy health care 
and life insurance programs. Employees of the Company who were formerly 
employees of Basis became eligible for postretirement benefits other than 
pensions under the Company plan effective January 1, 1998.
The following table sets forth for the Company postretirement benefits 
other than pensions, the funded status and amounts recognized in the Company
consolidated financial statements at December 31, 1997 and 1996 in thousands                               December 31,

For measurement purposes, the assumed health care cost trend rate was 5% 
in 1997, remaining level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate 
assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the obligation and 
periodic cost reported. An increase in the assumed health care cost trend 
rate by 1% in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of December 31, 1997 by $58 million and the aggregate of the 
service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit 
cost for the year then ended by $8 million. The weighted average discount 
rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 was 7% and 725%, respectively.
Profit-Sharing/Savings Plans
Prior to the Restructuring, Energy maintained a qualified profit-sharing 
plan the Thrift Plan. Effective at the time of the Distribution, the 
Company became the sponsor of the Thrift Plan and became solely responsible 
for all liabilities arising under the Thrift Plan after the time of the 
Distribution with respect to current Company employees and former employees 
of both Energy and the Company. Each Energy employee participating in the 
Thrift Plan prior to the Distribution who became a PG employee subsequent 
to the Distribution transferred their account balance to the PG thrift 
plan.  
The purpose of the Thrift Plan is to provide a program whereby 
contributions of participating employees and their employers are 
systematically invested to provide the employees an interest in the Company 
and to further their financial independence. Participation in the Thrift 
Plan is voluntary and is open to employees of the Company who become 
eligible to participate upon attaining age 21 and the completion of one 
year of continuous service. Employees of the Company who were formerly 
Basis employees became eligible to participate in the Thrift Plan on 
January 1, 1998 under the same service requirements as required for other 
Company employees, with service including prior employment with Basis. 
Basis previously existing 401k profit-sharing and retirement savings 
plan was maintained for such employees through December 31, 1997 and was 
merged into the Company Thrift Plan effective January 1, 1998.
Participating employees may contribute from 2% up to 22% of their total 
annual compensation, subject to certain limitations, to the Thrift Plan. 
Participants may elect to make such contributions on either a before-tax or 
after-tax basis, with federal income taxes on before-tax contributions being 
deferred until such time as a distribution is made to the participant. 
Participants' contributions to the Thrift Plan of up to 8% of their base 
annual compensation are matched 75% by the Company, with an additional match 
of up to 25% subject to certain conditions. Participants' contributions in 
excess of 8% of their base annual compensation are not matched by the 
Company. Up until termination of the VESOP see below in 1997, the Company 
made contributions to the Thrift Plan to the extent 75% of participants' base
contributions from 2% up to 8% of total base salary exceeded the amount 
of the Company contribution to the VESOP for debt service. Subsequent 
to the VESOP termination, all Company contributions were made to the Thrift 
Plan. Company contributions to the Thrift Plan were $2,253,000 in 1997. 
There were no Company contributions to the Thrift Plan in 1996 or 1995.
In 1989, Energy established the Valero Employees' Stock Ownership Plan 
VESOP which was a leveraged employee stock ownership plan. Pursuant to 
a private placement in 1989, the VESOP issued notes in the principal amount 
of $15 million. The net proceeds from this private placement were used 
by the VESOP trustee to fund the purchase of Energy common stock. During 
1991, Energy made an additional loan of $8 million to the VESOP which was 
also used by the trustee to purchase Energy common stock. The 1989 and 
1991 VESOP loans are referred to herein as the VESOP Notes. In connection
with effecting the Restructuring, on April 11, 1997, Energy Board of 
Directors approved the termination of the VESOP and subsequently directed 
the VESOP trustee to sell a sufficient amount of Energy common stock held 
in the VESOP suspense account to repay the outstanding amount of VESOP Notes 
and allocate the remaining stock in the suspense account to the accounts of 
the VESOP participants. The VESOP Notes were repaid in full in May 1997, 
after which 226,198 remaining shares of Energy common stock were allocated
to all VESOP participants.
As noted above, prior to termination of the VESOP, the Company annual 
contribution to the Thrift Plan was reduced by the Company contribution to 
the VESOP for debt service. During 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company 
contributed $586,000, $3,372,000 and $3,170,000, respectively, to the VESOP,
comprised of $58,000, $525,000 and $678,000, respectively, of interest on the
VESOP Notes and $541,000, $3,072,000 and $2,918,000, respectively, of 
compensation expense. Compensation expense was based on the VESOP debt 
principal payments for the portion of the VESOP established in 1989 and on 
the cost of the shares allocated to participants for the portion of the 
VESOP established in 1991. Dividends on VESOP shares of common stock were 
recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. Dividends on allocated shares
of common stock were paid to participants. Dividends paid on unallocated 
shares were used to reduce the Company contributions to the VESOP during 
1997, 1996 and 1995 by $13,000, $225,000 and $426,000, respectively. 
VESOP shares of common stock were considered outstanding for earnings per 
share computations. As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the number of 
allocated shares was 1,052,454 and 940,470, respectively, the number of 
committed-to-be-released shares was 62,918 for both years, and the number 
of suspense shares was 583,301 and 772,055, respectively.
Stock Compensation Plans
Prior to the Restructuring, Energy maintained various stock 
compensation plans. In connection with the Restructuring, all stock 
options held by Energy employees under any of such stock compensation plans 
that were granted prior to January 1, 1997 became 100% vested and immediately
exercisable upon the approval of the Restructuring by Energy stockholders 
on June 18, 1997. For all options still outstanding at the time of the 
Distribution, pursuant to the Employee Benefits Agreement, each option 
to purchase Energy Common Stock held by a current or former employee of 
the Company was converted into an option to acquire shares of Company Common 
Stock, and each option held by a current or former employee of Energy 
natural gas related services business was converted into an option to 
acquire shares of PG common stock. In each case, the number of options 
and related exercise prices were converted in such a manner so that the 
aggregate option value for each holder immediately after the Restructuring 
was equal to the aggregate option value immediately prior to the 
Restructuring. The other terms and conditions of any such converted 
option remained essentially unchanged. All restricted stock issued 
pursuant to Energy stock compensation plans became fully vested either 
upon the approval of the Restructuring by Energy stockholders on 
June 18, 1997 or upon the completion of the Restructuring on July 31, 1997.  
As of December 31, 1997, the Company had various fixed and 
performance-based stock compensation plans. The Company Executive 
Stock Incentive Plan the ESIP, which was maintained by Energy prior 
to the Restructuring, authorizes the grant of various stock and 
stock-related awards to executive officers and other key employees. 
Awards available under the ESIP include options to purchase shares 
of Common Stock, restricted stock which vests over a period determined 
by the Company compensation committee, and performance shares which 
vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal. A total of 
2,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock may be issued under the ESIP, of 
which no more than 1,000,000 shares may be issued as restricted stock. 
Under the ESIP, 6,250 shares of restricted stock were granted during the 
period August 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997 at a weighted average 
grant-date fair value of $3178 per share and 24,563 performance shares 
were granted during the period January 1, 1997 through July 31, 1997 at 
a weighted average grant-date fair value of $3458 per share. The Company 
also has a non-qualified stock option plan the Stock Option Plan which, 
at the date of the Restructuring, replaced three non-qualified stock option 
plans previously maintained by Energy. Awards under the Stock Option Plan 
are granted to key officers, employees and prospective employees of the 
Company. A total of 2,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock may be 
issued under the Stock Option Plan. The Company also maintains an 
Executive Incentive Bonus Plan, under which 200,000 shares of Company 
Common Stock may be issued, that provides bonus compensation to key 
employees of the Company based on individual contributions to Company 
profitability. Bonuses are payable either in cash or in whole or in 
part in Company Common Stock. No grants of Common Stock were made under 
this plan in 1997. The Company also has a non-employee director stock 
option plan, under which 200,000 shares of Company Common Stock may be 
issued, and a non-employee director restricted stock plan, under 
which 100,000 shares of Company Common Stock may be issued. During the 
period August 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997, 9,336 shares were granted 
under the non-employee director restricted stock plan at a weighted average 
grant-date fair value of $2894 per share.
Under the terms of the ESIP, the Stock Option Plan and the non-employee 
director stock option plan, the exercise price of the options granted will 
not be less than the fair market value of Common Stock at the date of grant.
Stock options become exercisable pursuant to the individual written agreements 
between the Company and the participants, generally in three equal annual 
installments beginning one year after the date of grant, with unexercised 
options expiring ten years from the date of grant. A summary of the status 
of the Company stock option plans, including options granted under the 
ESIP, the Stock Option Plan, the non-employee director stock option plan 
and Energy previously existing stock compensation plans, as of 
December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, and changes during the years then ended 
is presented in the table below. Note: Shares outstanding at July 31, 1997 
prior to the Restructuring differs from shares outstanding at August 1, 1997 
after the Restructuring because the August 1 amount: i excludes options 
held by current or former employees of Energy natural gas related services 
business which were converted to PG options and ii reflects the 
conversion of Energy options held by current or former employees of the 
Company to an equivalent number of Company options.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of 
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following 
weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 1997, 1996 and 1995, 
respectively: risk-free interest rates of 63 percent, 64 percent and 
67 percent; expected dividend yields of 15 percent, 19 percent and 28 
percent; expected lives of 32 years, 31 years and 32 years; and expected 
volatility of 262 percent, 255 percent and 295 percent.
For each share of stock that can be purchased thereunder pursuant to a 
stock option, the Stock Option Plan provides, and the predecessor stock 
option plans of Energy provided, that a SAR may also be granted. A SAR is
a right to receive a cash payment equal to the difference between the fair 
market value of Common Stock on the exercise date and the option price of 
the stock to which the SAR is related. SARs are exercisable only upon the 
exercise of the related stock options. At the end of each reporting 
period within the exercise period, the Company recorded an adjustment to 
compensation expense based on the difference between the fair market value 
of Common Stock at the end of each reporting period and the option price 
of the stock to which the SAR was related. During the January 1, 1997 
through July 31, 1997 period prior to the Restructuring, 88,087 SARs 
were exercised at a weighted-average exercise price of $1452 per share, 
and no SARs related to Company Common Stock remained outstanding as of 
July 31, 1997. During the August 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997 
period subsequent to the Restructuring, no SARs were granted.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations 
in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been 
recognized for its fixed stock option plans. The after-tax compensation 
cost reflected in net income for stock-based compensation plans was 
$46 million, $26 million and $17 million for 1997, 1996 and 1995, 
respectively. Of these amounts, $21 million, $14 million and 
$9 million related to the discontinued natural gas related services 
business. Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based 
compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant 
dates for 1997, 1996 and 1995 awards under those plans consistent with 
the method of SFAS No. 123, the Company net income and earnings per 
share for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 would have 
been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below  
Year Ended December 31, 
1997    1996   1995  
Net Income                As Reported   $96,096   $72,701   $59,838
Pro Forma    $92,304   $70,427   $58,373
Earnings per share            As Reported   $ 177   $ 140   $ 110
Pro Forma    $ 170   $ 135   $ 107
Earnings per share - assuming dilution  As Reported   $ 174   $ 142   $ 117
Pro Forma    $ 167   $ 138   $ 114  
Because the SFAS No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to 
awards granted prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation
cost may not be representative of that to be expected in future years. 
14. LEASE AND OTHER COMMITMENTS 
The Company has long-term operating lease commitments in connection 
with land, office facilities and equipment, and various facilities and 
equipment used in the storage, transportation and production of refinery 
feedstocks and/or refined products. Long-term leases for land have 
remaining primary terms of up to 267 years, while long-term leases for 
office facilities have remaining primary terms of up to 45 years. The 
Company long-term leases for production equipment, feedstock and refined 
product storage facilities and transportation assets have remaining primary 
terms of up to 141 years and in certain cases provide for various 
contingent payments based on, among other things, throughput volumes in 
excess of a base amount. 
Future minimum lease payments and minimum rentals to be received under
subleases as of December 31, 1997 for operating leases having initial or 
remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows 
in thousands:
1998                       $23,779
1999                       22,654
2000                       16,492

Less future minimum rentals to be received
under subleases                 1,354
$96,776
Consolidated rental expense under operating leases for continuing 
operations amounted to approximately $39,805,000, $26,739,000, and 
$24,177,000 for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Such amounts are 
included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in cost of 
sales and operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses 
and include various month-to-month and other short-term rentals in 
addition to rents paid and accrued under long-term lease commitments.
The Company has a product supply arrangement which requires the
payment of a reservation fee of approximately $104 million annually 
through August 2002.
15. LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES 
Litigation Relating to Operations of Basis Prior to Acquisition
Basis was named as a party to numerous claims and legal proceedings 
which arose prior to its acquisition by the Company. Pursuant to the 
stock purchase agreement between Energy, the Company, Salomon, and Basis, 
Salomon assumed the defense of all known suits, actions, claims and 
investigations pending at the time of the acquisition and all obligations, 
liabilities and expenses related to or arising therefrom. In addition, 
Salomon agreed to assume all obligations, liabilities and expenses related 
to or resulting from all private third-party suits, actions and claims which 
arise out of a state of facts existing on or prior to the time of the 
acquisition including superfund liability, but which were not pending 
at such time, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations. In 
certain pending matters, the plaintiffs are requesting injunctive relief 
which, if granted, could potentially result in the operations acquired in 
connection with the purchase of Basis being adversely affected through 
required reductions in emissions, discharges, or refinery throughput, 
which could be outside Salomon indemnity obligations. As discussed in 
Note 4, the Company and Salomon reached an agreement in December 1997 
whereby Salomon paid the Company $95 million in settlement of certain 
of Salomon contingent environmental obligations assumed under the stock
purchase agreement. This settlement did not affect Salomon other 
indemnity obligations described in this paragraph.
Litigation Relating to Discontinued Operations
Energy and certain of its natural gas related subsidiaries, as well as 
the Company, have been sued by Teco Pipeline Company Teco regarding the 
operation of the 340-mile West Texas pipeline in which a subsidiary of Energy
holds a 50% undivided interest. In 1985, a subsidiary of Energy sold a 50% 
undivided interest in the pipeline and entered into a joint venture through 
an ownership agreement and an operating agreement, each dated 
February 28, 1985, with the purchaser of the interest. In 1988, Teco 
succeeded to that purchaser 50% interest. A subsidiary of Energy has 
at all times been the operator of the pipeline. Notwithstanding the written 
ownership and operating agreements, the plaintiff alleges that a separate, 
unwritten partnership agreement exists, and that the defendants 
have exercised improper dominion over such alleged partnership affairs. 
The plaintiff also alleges that the defendants acted in bad faith by 
negatively affecting the economics of the joint venture in order to provide 
financial advantages to facilities or entities owned by the defendants and by 
allegedly usurping for the defendants' own benefit certain opportunities 
available to the joint venture. The plaintiff asserts causes of action for 
breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, tortious interference with business 
relationships, professional malpractice and other claims, and seeks 
unquantified actual and punitive damages. Energy motion to compel 
arbitration was denied, but Energy has filed an appeal. Energy has also 
filed a counterclaim alleging that the plaintiff breached its own 
obligations to the joint venture and jeopardized the economic and 
operational viability of the pipeline by its actions. Energy is seeking 
unquantified actual and punitive damages. Although PG previously acquired 
Teco and now ultimately owns both Teco and Energy after the Restructuring, 
PG Teco acquisition agreement purports to assign the benefit or 
detriment of this lawsuit to the former shareholders of Teco. Pursuant 
to the Distribution Agreement by which the Company was spun off to Energy 
stockholders in connection with the Restructuring, the Company has agreed to 
indemnify and hold harmless Energy with respect to this lawsuit to the 
extent of 50% of the amount of any final judgment or settlement amount 
not in excess of $30 million, and 100% of that part of any final judgment 
or settlement amount in excess of $30 million.
General
The Company is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings 
arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it is 
unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to 
which the Company is a party would have a material adverse effect on the 
Company financial statements; however, due to the inherent uncertainty 
of litigation, the range of possible loss, if any, cannot be estimated 
with a reasonable degree of precision and there can be no assurance 
that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have 
an adverse effect on the Company results of operations for the interim 
period in which such resolution occurred.
