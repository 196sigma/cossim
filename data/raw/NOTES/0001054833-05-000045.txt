Item 8: Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Coventry Health Care, Inc.: We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coventry Health Care, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at a2. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein. We
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of Coventry Health Care, Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations for the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 15, 2005 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon. ERNST YOUNG LLP Baltimore, Maryland

2004 Significant Accounting
Policies Principles
of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are 100% owned. All significant inter-company
transactions have been eliminated. Use
of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those amounts. Reclassifications -
Certain 2003 and 2002 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2004
presentation. Stock
Split - On December 23, 2003, the Companys Board of Directors approved a
three-for-two stock split of the Companys common stock. The stock split,
in the form of a stock dividend, was distributed January 30, 2004 for stockholders of
record on January 9, 2004. The stock split is reflected retroactively in the
Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for all periods
presented. 
46 Table of Contents Significant
Customers - The Companys commercial business is diversified across a large
customer base and there are no commercial groups that make up 10% or more of
Coventrys managed care premiums. The Company received 109%, 108% and 123% of its
managed care premiums for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
from the federal Medicare program throughout its various markets. The Company also
received 117%, 118% and 131% of its managed care premiums for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, from its state-sponsored Medicaid programs
throughout its various markets. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the State of
Missouri accounted for over half the Companys Medicaid premiums. Cash
and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market
funds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The Company considers all highly
liquid securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents reported in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value. Investments
- - The Company accounts for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115 - Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company invests primarily in fixed
income securities and classifies all of its investments as available-for-sale. Investments
are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are
other-than-temporary. In making that determination, the Company considers all available
evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is
not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables;
the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost;
the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer;
the Companys intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value;
elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal;
rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and
expected cash flows of a debt security. 
Temporary
declines in value of investments classified as available-for-sale are netted with
unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of
stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to
be other-than-temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included
in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a
specific identification basis. Investments
with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are classified
as short-term investments and generally consist of corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury notes
and commercial paper. Long-term investments have original maturities in excess of one year
and primarily consist of fixed income securities. Other
Receivables - Other receivables include interest receivables, pharmacy rebate
receivables, receivables from providers and suppliers and any other receivables that do
not relate to premiums. Property
and Equipment - Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the
related assets or, if shorter, over the terms of the respective leases. Long-term
Assets - Long-term assets primarily include assets associated with the Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan SERP and deferred tax assets. Business
Combinations, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles - The Company accounts
for business combinations, goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with SFAS No. 141
- - Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142 - Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. Acquired intangible assets are separately recognized upon meeting
certain criteria. Such intangible assets include, but are not limited to, trade and
service marks, non-compete agreements, customer lists and licenses. Goodwill and other
intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for
impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. The Company uses three approaches to
identifying the fair value of its goodwill and other intangible assets: the market
approach, the market capitalization approach and the income approach. The market approach
estimates a businesss fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies.
The market capitalization approach is based on market value of the Companys total
shares outstanding. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future
cash flows. As impairment charges occur, write-down charges will be recorded in the period
in which the impairment took place. See Note C to consolidated financial statements for
disclosure related to intangible assets. 
47 Table of Contents Medical
Liabilities and Expense - Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but
not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. The estimated
claims incurred but not reported are based on historical data, current enrollment, health
service utilization statistics and other related information. In determining medical
liabilities, the Company employs standard actuarial reserve methods that are specific to
each markets membership, product characteristics, geographic territories and
provider network. The Company also considers utilization frequency and unit costs of
inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and other medical expenses, as well as claim payment
backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements. The Company also establishes reserves,
if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract
maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future
premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. These accruals are continually
monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are
reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by
changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term. The
following table shows the components of the change in medical liabilities for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively:

Acquisition
balances represent medical liabilities as of the applicable acquisition date. Subsequent
changes in estimates related to the acquired balances are recorded as adjustments to the
settlement account with the acquired entitys previous owner. The
negative amounts noted as prior year medical costs are favorable adjustments
for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted
above, these favorable changes from original estimates occur due to changes in
medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. Other
Long-term Liabilities - Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of liabilities
associated with the SERP and the deferred tax liability associated with the net unrealized
gains on investments. Revenue
Recognition - Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which
members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on a per subscriber contract rate and
the subscribers in the Companys records at the time of billing. Premium billings are
generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings
may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive
terminations, additions, or other changes. The Company also receives premium payments from
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS on a monthly basis for
its Medicare membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled
with CMS and such reconciliations could result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums collected in advance are
recorded as deferred revenue. Employer contracts are typically on an annual basis, subject
to cancellation by the employer group or by the Company upon 30 days notice. Based
on information received subsequent to premium billings being sent, historical trends, bad
debt write-offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, the Company estimates, on a
monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future retroactivity and adjusts its revenue and
reserves accordingly. 
48 Table of Contents Premiums
for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the Office of
Personnel Management OPM on a periodic basis. Such audits are usually a
number of years in arrears. Adjustments are recorded as additional information regarding
the audits and reviews becomes available. Any differences between actual results and
estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. The
Company enters into performance guarantees with employer groups where the Company
guarantees that it will meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could
involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy and
telephone on-hold time. Under these performance guarantees, the Company could be at risk
for not maintaining the standards agreed upon in the contracts. The risk level varies by
agreement with penalties based on a variety of calculations including per member per
month, percentage of premium, or percentage of administration fees. Performance levels are
evaluated at least quarterly. The Company estimates its potential exposure and records the
appropriate reserves. Stock-based
Compensation - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees
under Accounting Principles Board APB No. 25 - Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and complies with the disclosure requirements for
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123 -
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and SFAS No. 148 -
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure.

December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB
Statement No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No.
123. SFAS No. 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No.
25, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach
in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No.
123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma
disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS
No. 123R must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in
periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company expects to
adopt SFAS No. 123R on July 1, 2005 using the modified-prospective method. Under
the modified-prospective method, compensation cost is recognized beginning on the adoption
date based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted
after the effective date and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards
granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested
on the effective date. As
permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to
employees using APB No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, has recognized no
compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No.
123Rs fair value method will have an effect on its results of operations, although
it will have no material effect on its overall financial position. The effect of adoption
of SFAS No. 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of
share-based payments granted in the future. However, had the Company adopted SFAS No.
123R in prior periods using the Black-Scholes method of valuation, the effect of that
standard would have approximated the effect of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure
of pro forma net income and earnings per share above. SFAS No. 123R also requires the
benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a
financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current
literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net
financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what
those amounts will be in the future as it is dependent upon, among other things, when
employees exercise stock options, the amounts of operating cash flows that would have
been recognized under SFAS No. 123 in prior periods for such excess tax benefits were
$158 million, $156 million, and $129 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. See
Note G to consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to stock-based
compensation. Contract
Acquisition Costs - Costs related to the acquisition of customer contracts, such as
commissions paid to outside brokers, are expensed as incurred. Income
Taxes - The Company files a consolidated federal tax return for the Company and its
subsidiaries. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109 -
Accounting for Income Taxes. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are
determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax
reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in
effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. See Note F to consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to income
taxes. Earnings
Per Share - Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share assume the exercise
of all options and warrants and the vesting of all restricted stock using the treasury
stock method. B. ACQUISITIONS During
the three years ended December 31, 2004, the Company completed several business
combinations and membership purchases. The Companys business combinations are all
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating
results of each acquisition have been included in the Companys consolidated
financial statements since their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for
each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable
intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the
purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The
purchase price of the Companys membership purchases is allocated to identifiable
intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of ten to twenty years. 
50 Table of Contents The
following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the
three years ended December 31, 2004. The purchase price of each business combination
includes the payment for net worth and estimated transition costs. The estimated
transition costs may be adjusted as actual expenses are incurred, thereby affecting the
final purchase price of the acquisition. In addition, most of the Companys
acquisition agreements contain a provision for a final retroactive balance sheet
settlement which may result in adjustments to the purchase price. The purchase price,
inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements to date and transaction cost
adjustments, is presented below in thousands:

INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill
and other intangible assets consist of costs in excess of the fair value of the net
tangible assets of subsidiaries or operations acquired through December 31, 2004. Goodwill As
described in the Companys segment disclosure, assets are not allocated to specific
products, and, accordingly, goodwill can not be reported by segment. The Company has
completed its impairment test of goodwill and has determined that there was no impairment
of goodwill as of October 1, 2004, the Companys annual impairment test date. The

Company considers all of its investments as available-for-sale securities and,
accordingly, records unrealized gains and losses, except for those determined to be
other-than-temporary impairments, as other comprehensive income in the stockholders
equity section of its consolidated balance sheets. The

The
securities referenced in this table do not meet the criteria for an
other-than-temporarily impaired investment. These securities have an investment
grade credit rating. The current unrealized loss is the result of interest rate increases
and not unfavorable changes the credit ratings associated with these securities. These
investments are not in high risk industries or sectors and the Company intends to hold
these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value. 
54 Table of Contents F. INCOME TAXES At
December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $53 million of federal and $93 million of
state tax net operating loss carryforwards. The net operating losses were primarily
acquired through various acquisitions. The net operating loss carryforwards can be used to
reduce future taxable income until they expire through the year 2024. The

The
valuation allowance at December 31, 2003 for deferred tax assets was due to the
Companys belief that the realization of the deferred tax asset resulting from net
operating losses associated with certain acquisitions was unlikely. There is no valuation
allowance at December 31, 2004 because now that these acquired companies are consistently
profitable, the Company believes that the realization of the deferred tax asset is more
likely than not. G. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Stock-Based
Compensation As
of December 31, 2004, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Amended and Restated
2004 Stock Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan under which shares of the
Companys common stock were authorized for issuance to key employees, consultants and
directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. The
Stock Incentive Plan is authorized to grant either incentive stock options or nonqualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards at
the discretion of the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors. At
the annual meeting of shareholders held on June 3, 2004, the Companys shareholders
voted to increase the shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the Stock
Incentive Plan from an aggregate of 165 million shares to an aggregate of 225 million
shares. Shares available for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan were 47 million and
18 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Stock Options Under
the Stock Incentive Plan, the terms and conditions of option grants are established on an
individual basis with the exercise price of the options being equal to not less than 100%
of the fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Options generally become
exercisable after one year in 25% increments per year and expire ten years from the date
of grant. At December 31, 2004, the Stock Incentive Plan had outstanding options
representing 66 million shares of common stock.

The
weighted-average grant date fair values for options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were
$2007, $1069 and $1044, respectively. Restricted Stock Awards During
2004, the Company awarded 563,000 shares of restricted stock. The weighted average fair
value, at the measurement date, of the restricted stock awards was $5278. The fair value
of the restricted shares is amortized over various vesting periods through 2008. The
Company recorded compensation expense related to restricted stock grants, including
restricted stock granted in prior periods of approximately $155 million, $96 million and
$57 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
deferred portion of the restricted stock is reported as a reduction to additional paid in
capital and was $372 million at December 31, 2004. Employee
Stock Purchase Plan The
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, implemented in 1994,
allows substantially all employees who meet length of service requirements to set aside a
portion of their salary for the purchase of the Companys common stock. At the end of
each plan year, the Company issues the stock to participating employees at an issue price
equal to 85% of the lower of the stock price at the end of the plan year or the average
stock price, as defined. The Company has reserved 14 million shares of stock for this
plan and has issued 25,900, 25,700 and 16,500 shares in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Remaining shares available for issuance under the ESPP were 12 million as of December 31,
2004. 
57 Table of Contents Employee
Retirement Plans As
of December 31, 2004, the Company had two defined contribution retirement plans qualifying
under the Internal Revenue Code Section 401k: the Coventry Health Care, Inc. Retirement
Savings Plan the Savings Plan and the Mid-America Health Partners Inc.
401k and Investment Plan the MAH Plan. All employees of Coventry Health
Care, Inc. and employees of its subsidiaries can elect to participate in the Savings Plan.
T. Rowe Price is the custodial trustee of all Savings Plan assets, participant loans and
the Coventry Health Care, Inc. common stock in the Savings Plan. Under
the Savings Plan, participants may defer up to 15% of their eligible compensation, limited
by the maximum compensation deferral amount permitted by applicable law. The Company makes
matching contributions in the Companys common stock equal to 100% of the
participants contribution on the first 3% of the participants eligible
compensation and equal to 50% of the participants contribution on the second 3% of
the participants eligible compensation. Participants will vest in the Companys
matching contributions in 50% increments annually on their anniversary date over a period
of two years of service with the Company. Effective January 1, 2004, the Savings Plan was
amended to permit divestiture, whereby employees with three or more years of service were
eligible to sell the employer match portion of the Coventry common stock in their
accounts, during certain times of the year, and transfer the proceeds to other Coventry
401k funds of their choosing. All costs of the Savings Plan are funded by the Company
and participants as they are incurred. Several
acquisitions have been completed since the adoption of the Savings Plan. Pursuant to
specific terms of each acquisitions respective merger agreement, the surviving
entity 1 became an adopting employer of the Savings Plan, and/or 2 commenced
participation in the Savings Plan following approval by the Companys Board of
Directors.    Merged/Acquired Entity

upon participation in the Savings Plan, all participant account balances included in the
assets of the former qualified retirement plan were rolled over into the Savings Plan and
employees were permitted to commence participation in the Savings Plan, except for
participants of the former Mid-America Health Partners. All employees of the former
Mid-America Health Partners were eligible to participate in the Savings Plan effective
December 2, 2002; however their balance in the MAH Plan remained in the MAH Plan. The MAH
Plan was terminated effective December 1, 2002 and the MAH Plan assets will remain until
the earlier of i termination of employment with Coventry or one of its affiliates; or
ii receipt of the Internal Revenue Service determination letter approving the
termination of the MAH Plan. No contributions were made to the MAH Plan after December 1,
2002. The MAH Plan assets are held by Fidelity Management Trust Company, the funding agent
of the assets held under the terms of the Plan and Trust. All participants in the MAH Plan

The Altius Plan assets were held by Reliance Trust Company, the funding agent of the
assets held under the terms of the Plan and Trust. All participants in the Altius Plan
were 100% vested in employer matching contributions as of September 1, 2003. All costs of
the Altius Plan were funded by the Company and participants as they were incurred. Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan As

Plan the SERP, currently known as the Coventry Health Care, Inc.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Under the SERP, participants may defer up to 15%
of their base salary and up to 100% of any bonus awarded. The Company makes matching
contributions equal to 100% of the participants contribution on the first 3% of the
participants compensation and 50% of the participants contribution on the
second 3% of the participants compensation. Participants vest in the Companys
matching contributions ratably over two years. All costs of the SERP are funded by the
Company as they are incurred. The
cost, principally employer matching contributions, of the Savings Plan and the SERP
charged to operations for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $75 million, $73 million and $54
million, respectively. 
58 Table of Contents H. SENIOR NOTES On
February 1, 2002, the Company completed a transaction to sell $1750 million original
8125% senior notes due February 15, 2012 in a private placement. These senior notes were
then registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The proceeds from the sale of
senior notes were used to purchase, from Principal Health Care, Inc., 71 million shares
of Coventry common stock and a warrant exercisable, at that time, for 31 million shares
of Coventry common stock. The aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and
the warrant was $1761 million. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August
15 each year. In
August 2003, the Company repurchased a portion of its senior notes with a face value of
$45 million and a weighted average premium of 89%. The Company recorded a loss on the
repurchase in accordance with SFAS No. 145 which requires gains and losses on
extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations. The
loss of $05 million was included as additional senior notes interest expense. The
carrying value of the senior notes is equal to the face value and the fair value is based
on the quoted market prices. As of December 31, 2004, the carrying value was $1705
million and the fair value was $1852 million. As of December 31, 2003, the carrying value
was $1705 million and the fair value was $1897 million. The
senior notes contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding incurring additional
debt, limiting dividends or other restricted payments, and restricting transactions with
affiliates, sales of assets and consolidations or mergers. The Company has complied with
all covenants under the senior notes. I. COMMITMENTS AND

finance the acquisition of First Health Group Corporations outstanding common stock,
refinance the existing indebtedness of First Health and pay related transaction fees and
expenses. See Note P to consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to
subsequent events. Leases The
Company operates primarily in leased facilities with original lease terms of up to ten
years with options for renewal. Through its acquisitions, the Company has office equipment
leases with terms of approximately three years. Total
rent expense was $190 million, $174 million and $152 million, for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
59 Table of Contents Legal
Proceedings In
the normal course of business, the Company has been named as a defendant in various legal
actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by the Company, medical
malpractice actions, employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary
damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be
brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2004 may result in the
assertion of additional claims. The Company maintains general liability, professional
liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that it believes are
appropriate, with varying deductibles for which it maintains reserves. The professional
liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through its captive
subsidiary. Coventry
Health Care, Inc. is a defendant in the provider track in the Managed Care Litigation
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami
Division, Multi-District Litigation MDL, styled In re: Managed Care
Litigation, MDL No. 1334. This lawsuit was filed by a group of physicians as a class
action against Coventry and twelve other companies in the managed care industry. The
plaintiffs have alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act RICO, conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting a scheme to
violate RICO. In addition to these federal law claims, the complaint includes state law
claims for breach of contract, violations of various state prompt payment laws and
equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The trial court has dismissed
several of the state law claims and ordered that all physicians who have an arbitration
provision in their provider contracts must submit their direct RICO claims and all of
their remaining state law claims to arbitration. As a consequence of this ruling, all the
plaintiffs who have arbitration provisions voluntarily dismissed all of their claims that
are subject to arbitration. The trial court however has ordered that the plaintiffs
claims of conspiracy, conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting violations of
RICO are not subject to arbitration. The defendants appeal to the 11th Circuit
challenging the trial courts arbitration decision was denied. The trial court has
certified various subclasses of physicians; however, Coventry is not subject to the class
certification order because the motion to certify was filed before Coventry was joined as
a defendant. The plaintiffs have now filed a motion to certify various subclasses as to
Coventry. Coventry has filed its opposition to that motion which remains pending before
the trial court. The defendants who were subject to the class certification order filed an
appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals has overturned the class
certification order as to the plaintiffs state law claims but affirmed the
certification with respect to the plaintiffs federal law claims. The U.S. Supreme
Court has denied the defendants petition to review the 11th Circuits class
certification decision. Two defendants have entered into settlement agreements with the
plaintiffs. Both settlement agreements have been filed with the Court and have received
final approval. This MDL lawsuit has triggered the filing of copycat class action
complaints by other health care providers such as chiropractors, podiatrists,
acupuncturists and other licensed health care professionals. Each of these actions has
been transferred to the MDL and has been designated as tag-along actions.
The court has entered an order which stays all proceedings in the tag-along actions
until all pre-trial proceedings in the MDL action have been concluded. Although the
Company can not predict the outcome, management believes that the MDL lawsuit and
tag-along actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position
or its results of operations. Management also believes that the claims asserted in these
lawsuits are without merit, and the Company intends to defend its position. Several
companies in the insurance industry have received subpoenas for information from the New
York Attorney General and the Connecticut Attorney General with respect to an industrywide
investigation into certain insurance brokerage practices, including broker compensation
arrangements, bid quoting practices and potential antitrust violations. Coventry has not
been served with any such subpoenas. As
a consequence of the Attorney General investigations in New York and Connecticut,
Coventry, like most other companies in the insurance industry, has received Letters of
Inquiry from the departments of insurance in several states in which it does business.
These Letters, which are very similar, if not identical, seek information regarding broker
compensation arrangements, bid quoting practices and conduct which may potentially
constitute antitrust violations. Coventry has provided the information requested by these
Letters and currently does not anticipate any additional follow up or requests for
additional information. Capitation
Arrangements A
small percentage of the Companys membership is covered by global capitation
arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of
premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the globally capitated members. Under
some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk
sharing and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit the
Companys exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose the Company to
risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider
organization. In addition to global capitation arrangements, the Company has capitation
arrangements for ancillary services, such as mental health care. The Company is ultimately
responsible for the coverage of its members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the
extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise
is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, the Company will
be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, the Company may have to incur costs
in excess of the amounts it would otherwise have to pay under the original global or
ancillary capitation arrangements. Medical costs associated with capitation arrangements
made up approximately 71%, 99%, and 89% of the Companys total medical costs for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Membership associated with
global capitation arrangements was approximately 127,000, 145,000 and 116,000 as of
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
60 Table of Contents Federal
Employees Health Benefits Program The
Company contracts with the Office of Personnel Management OPM to provide
managed health care services under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program
FEHBP. These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations
establish premium rating arrangements for this program. The OPM conducts periodic audits
of its contractors to, among other things, verify that the premiums established under its
contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under FEHBP.
The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that
participate in the program. HealthAmerica
Pennsylvania, Inc. HealthAmerica, the Companys Pennsylvania HMO
subsidiary, received audit reports from the OPM that questioned approximately $311
million of subscription charges that were paid to HealthAmerica under the FEHBP for
contract years 1993 - 1999. In the fourth quarter of 2003, HealthAmerica settled this
dispute with the OPM and the U.S. Department of Justice. The final settlement payment of
$290 million was fully reserved by HealthAmerica and therefore had no impact on 2003
earnings, the regulated capital of HealthAmerica, or its consolidated stockholders
equity. J. CONCENTRATIONS OF
CREDIT RISK The
Companys financial instruments that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of
cash equivalents, investments in fixed income securities and accounts receivable. The
Company invests its excess cash in state and municipal bonds, U.S. Treasury and agency
securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt and other
securities. Investments in marketable securities are managed within guidelines established
by the Board of Directors, which require investment-grade fixed income securities and
limit the amount that may be invested in any one issuer. The fair value of the
Companys financial instruments is equivalent to their carrying value and, although
there is some credit risk associated with these instruments, the Company believes this
risk to be minimal. Concentration
of credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to the large number of customers
comprising the Companys customer base and their breakdown among geographical
locations. The Company believes the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides
for estimated losses as of December 31, 2004. The Company has a risk of incurring losses
if such allowances are not adequate. K. STATUTORY INFORMATION The
Companys HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory
agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent
may receive from its regulated entities. During 2004, the Company received $1736 million
in dividends and $126 million for note repayments from its regulated subsidiaries. The
National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC has proposed that
states adopt risk-based capital RBC standards that, if adopted, would
generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other
risk-bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of
capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business
operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care
organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and
reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower
for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital
can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. The
Companys health plans are required to submit an RBC report to the NAIC and their
domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. Regulators
will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory
actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan
explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to
the health plan being placed under regulatory control The
majority of states in which the Company operates health plans have adopted an RBC policy
that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company
Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. The Company has adopted
an internal policy to maintain all of its regulated subsidiaries statutory capital
and surplus at or above 250% of their RBC and a level of 300% in aggregate referred to
below as 300% of RBC. Some states in which the Companys regulated
subsidiaries operate require deposits to be maintained with the respective states
departments of insurance. The table below summarizes the Companys statutory reserve
information as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 in millions except percentage data.

The
increase in capital and surplus for the Companys regulated subsidiaries is a result
of income from 2004 offset by dividends paid to the parent company. Excluding
funds held by entities subject to regulation, the Company had cash and investments of
approximately $3831 million and $2095 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003, respectively. The increase in non-regulated cash and investments is primarily a
result of dividends received from subsidiaries mentioned above and ordinary operating
activities offset by stock repurchases made and payments for acquisitions. During the year
ended December 31, 2004, Coventry made capital contributions of approximately $200
million to the Companys HMO subsidiaries. Of this total, $160 million was made to
the Companys newly formed Michigan subsidiary to meet statutory capital
requirements. L. OTHER INCOME Other
income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 includes investment income,
net of fees, of approximately $441 million, $402 million and $409 million,
respectively. M. SHARE REPURCHASE
PROGRAM The
Companys Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase up to 10% of its
outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing
prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. As a part of this
program, the Company purchased 33million shares of its common stock in 2002 at an
aggregate cost of $655million, no shares in 2003 and 20million shares during
the first quarter of 2004 at an aggregate cost of $846million. The total remaining
common shares the Company is authorized to repurchase under the program is approximately
18million as of December31, 2004. Excluded from these amounts are shares
purchased in exchange for employee payroll taxes on vesting of restricted stock awards as
these purchases are not part of the program. N. SEGMENT INFORMATION The
Company has three reportable segments: Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products. The
products are provided to a cross section of employer groups and individuals throughout the
Companys health plans. Commercial products include HMO, PPO and POS products. HMO
products provide comprehensive health care benefits to members through a primary care
physician. PPO and POS products permit members to participate in managed care but allow
them the flexibility to utilize out-of-network providers in exchange for increased
out-of-pocket costs. The Company provides comprehensive health benefits to members
participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs and receives premium payments from federal
and state governments.

January 28, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of First Health Group Corporation
First Health. First Health is a full service national health benefits
services company, headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois, that serves the group health,
workers compensation and state public program markets. Each outstanding share of
First Health common stock was converted into a right to receive $9375 cash and 01791
shares of Coventry common stock. As a result of the merger, the Company paid $8632
million in cash and issued approximately 165 million shares of its common stock to
stockholders of First Health. In
connection with the acquisition, Coventry entered into new senior, unsecured credit
facilities consisting of a $300 million five-year term loan, all of which was drawn at
closing, and a $150 million five-year revolving credit facility, of which $65 million was
drawn at closing. Loans
under the new senior credit facilities bear interest at a margin or spread in excess of
either 1 the one-, two-, three- or six-month rate for the Eurodollar deposits the
Eurodollar Rate or 2 the greater of the federal funds rate plus 05% or the
prime rate of the Administrative Agent ABR, as selected by the Company. The
margin or spread depends on the debt ratings assigned to the new credit facilities and the
Companys consolidated leverage ratio and varies from 075% to 2% for Eurodollar Rate
loans and from 0% to 1% for ABR loans. Commitment fees will accrue and be payable
quarterly in arrears at an initial rate of 0375% per annum, and subsequently at a rate
ranging from 025% to 05% depending on the debt ratings assigned to the new credit
facilities and the Companys consolidated leverage ratio, multiplied by the daily
average undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility. The
Credit Agreement contains covenants, including, among other things, covenants that
restrict the Companys ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to: incur
additional indebtedness; incur guarantee obligations; create or permit liens on assets,
engage in mergers or consolidations; dispose of assets; pay dividends or other
distributions, purchase or redeem the Companys equity securities or those of its
subsidiaries and make other restricted payments; make loans, advances or other investments
including acquisitions; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; agree with
others to limit their ability to grant liens on assets; agree with others to limit the
ability of the Companys subsidiaries to pay dividends or other restricted payments
or to make loans or transfer assets to the Company or another of its subsidiaries. The new
senior credit facilities also require compliance with specified financial ratios and
tests, including a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a
minimum net worth requirement. Coventry
also closed the private placement of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5 7/8%
senior notes due 2012 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6 1/8% senior notes
due 2015. These senior notes have since been registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The senior notes are general unsecured obligations of Coventry and rank equal
in right of payment to all of Coventrys existing and future senior debt, including
its existing 8125% senior notes due 2012 and its new credit facilities. The
Indentures under which the notes have been issued, among other things, restrict the
Companys ability and the ability of the Companys restricted subsidiaries to:
make investments; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other
distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock; create liens; incur
dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and merge or consolidate
with other entities. From and after the date on which the notes receive investment grade
ratings from two designated rating agencies, certain covenants related to the notes will
terminate. Coventry
used the proceeds from the new credit facilities and senior notes, together with
approximately $221 million of cash on hand, to fund the First Health acquisition,
including the repayment of First Healths outstanding bank debt and related
transaction expenses. Item 1: Business

Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Coventrys
management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under
the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. 
64 Table of Contents Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; 2 provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the
Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and 3 provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may
deteriorate. Coventrys
management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO,
Internal Controls - Integrated Framework, and believes that the COSO framework
is a suitable framework for such an evaluation. Management has concluded that the
Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2004. Ernst
Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the
Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, has
issued an attestation report on managements assessment of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting which is included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K. Disclosure Controls and
Procedures We
have performed an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule
13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , under the supervision
and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.
Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting There
have been no significant changes in our internal controls over the financial reporting
during the quarter ended December 31, 2004 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Coventry Health Care, Inc. We
have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Coventry Health Care,
Inc. the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion. A companys internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, inreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the

of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. In
our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the Companys consolidated balance sheets as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, and our report dated February 15, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion.
