ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors
SPACEHAB, Incorporated and Subsidiaries     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
SPACEHAB, Incorporated and subsidiaries the Company as of June 30, 1999 and
1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June
30, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SPACEHAB,
Incorporated and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended June 30, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.                               /s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1   DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY
SPACEHAB, Incorporated the Company is the first company to
commercially develop, own and operate habitable modules that provide
space-based laboratory research facilities and cargo services aboard
the U.S. Space Shuttle system. The Company currently owns and operates
three pressurized laboratory and logistics supply modules, which
significantly enhance the capabilities of the Space Shuttle fleet. The
Company is currently constructing a new research module with associated
double module hardware. The Company modules are unique to the Space
Shuttle fleet.
To date, the Company has successfully completed thirteen
missions aboard the Space Shuttle and substantially all of the
Company revenue has been generated under contracts with NASA. The
Company contracts are subject to periodic funding allocations by
NASA. NASA funding is dependent on receiving annual appropriations
from the United States government. During the years ended June 30,
1999, 1998 and 1997, approximately 80%, 68% and 88% of the Company
revenues were generated under U.S. Government contracts.
On February 12, 1997, the Company acquired the assets and
certain of the liabilities of Astrotech Space Operations, L.P.
Astrotech, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, a provider of
commercial satellite launch processing services and payload processing
facilities in the United States. These services are provided at the
Astrotech facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida and Vandenberg Air
Force Base in California, and are provided to launch service providers
on a fixed-price basis. Additionally, Astrotech provides management and
consulting services to the Boeing Company for its Sea Launch program at
the Boeing facility in Long Beach, California.
On July 1, 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Johnson Engineering Corporation JE. JE
performs several critical services for NASA including flight crew
support services, operations, training and fabrication of mockups at
NASA Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory and at NASA Space Vehicle Mockup
Facility, where astronauts train for both Space Shuttle and ISS
missions. JE also designs and fabricates flight hardware, such as
flight crew equipment and crew quarters' habitability outfitting as
well as providing stowage integration services. JE is also responsible
for configuration management of the ISS.
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
SPACEHAB, Incorporated and its wholly owned subsidiaries Astrotech and
JE. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For purposes of its consolidated statements of cash flows, the
Company considers short-term investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
primarily made up of commercial paper investments recorded at cost,
which approximates market value.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. All furniture,
fixtures and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets                    25
27
which is generally five years. The Company payload processing
facilities are depreciated using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives ranging from sixteen to forty-three years.
Through June 30, 1997, the Company flight modules were
depreciated over a ten-year period using the straight-line method.
Effective July 1, 1997, the Company extended the estimated useful lives
of its space modules through 2012. This change in accounting estimate
is treated prospectively and was based on then currently available
information from NASA, which estimated the duration of the Space
Shuttle program through at least 2012. As a result of this change in
estimate, the Company net income increased by $62 million for FY
1998.
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets
and for Long-lived Assets to be Disposed Of Statement 121. Statement
121 requires that long-lived assets to be held and used, including
goodwill, be reviewed by the Company for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted net
cash flows associated with the asset are less than the asset carrying
amount. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the
carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.
GOODWILL
The excess of the cost over the fair value of net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired in purchase business
combinations has been assigned to goodwill. Goodwill is being amortized
on a straight-line basis over twenty to twenty-five years.
INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES
The Company generally uses the equity method of accounting for
its investments in, and earnings of, investees. In accordance with the
equity method of accounting, the carrying amount of such an investment
is initially recorded at cost and is increased to reflect the Company
share of the investee income and is reduced to reflect the Company
share of the investee losses. For those investments for which the
Company has provided substantially all of the investee funding, the
Company uses the modified equity method of accounting whereby 100% of
the investee current period earnings or losses are recognized.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation Statement
123, which encourages, but does not require, the recognition of
stock-based employee compensation at fair value. The Company has
elected to continue to account for stock-based employee compensation
using the intrinsic value method as prescribed in Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for options to
purchase common stock granted to employees is measured as the excess,
if any, of the fair value of common stock at the date of the grant over
the exercise price an employee must pay to acquire the common stock.
Warrants to purchase common stock granted to other than
employees as consideration for goods or services rendered are
recognized at fair value.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Prior to the REALMS contract note 10, the Company recognized
revenue upon completion of each module flight. Total contract price was
allocated to each flight based on the amount of services the Company
provided on the flight relative to the total services provided for                    26
28
all flights under contract. Obligations associated with a specific
mission, e.g., integration services, were also recognized upon
completion of the mission. Costs directly related to specific missions
were deferred until the respective missions were completed.
For all other contract awards for which the capability to
successfully complete the contract can be reasonably assured and costs
at completion can be reliably estimated at contract inception, revenue
recognition under the percentage-of-completion method is being used
based on costs incurred over the period of the contract. Revenue
provided by Astrotech payload processing services is recognized
ratably over the occupancy period of the satellite while in the
Astrotech facilities. Revenue provided by JE is primarily based on
cost-plus award fee contracts, whereby revenue is recognized to the
extent of costs incurred plus estimates of award fee revenues using the
percentage-of-completion method. Award fees, which provide earnings
based on the Company contract performance as determined by NASA
evaluations, are recorded when the amounts can be reasonably estimated,
or are awarded. Changes in estimated costs to complete, provisions for
contract losses and estimated amounts recognized as award fees are
recognized in the period they become known.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and
liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
In December 1997, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per
Share, Statement 128. Statement 128 supersedes Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 15, Earnings per Share APB 15 and its related
interpretations, and promulgates new accounting standards for the
computation and manner of presentation of the Company earnings loss
per share. The Company has restated previously reported annual earnings
per share data in accordance with the provisions of Statement 128 note
14. The Company does not believe that the adoption of Statement 128
had a material impact on the computation or manner of presentation of
its earnings loss per share data as currently or previously presented
under APB 15.
Basic earnings loss per share are calculated by dividing net
income loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period.
The computation of diluted earnings loss per share includes
all common stock options and warrants and other common stock, to the
extent dilutive, that potentially may be issued as a result of
conversion privileges, including the convertible subordinated notes
payable note 8.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
During fiscal year 1999, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income SFAS No. 130. SFAS No.                    27
29
130 requires the display of comprehensive income, which includes
unrealized gains or losses on investments and accumulated foreign
currency translation adjustments, if any. There were no such components
of other comprehensive income for the years ended June 30, 1999, 1998
or 1997.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported
periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain FY 1997 and 1998 amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the fiscal 1999 consolidated financial statement
presentation.
3  STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Cash paid for interest costs was approximately $54 million,
$34 million and $13 million for the years ended June 30, 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively. The Company capitalized interest of
approximately $25 million, $20 million and $03 million during the
years ended June 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, related to the
module improvements and building in progress.
The Company paid income taxes of approximately $04 million, $19
thousand and $24 million for the years ended June 30, 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively.

5  ACQUISITIONS
JOHNSON ENGINEERING
On July 1, 1998, the Company paid approximately $247 million,
including transaction costs, to acquire all of the capital stock of JE.
The business combination has been accounted for using the purchase
method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Business
Combinations, APB Opinion 16. The purchase price has been allocated
to the assets and liabilities acquired based on estimates of fair value
as of the date of acquisition. Based on the allocation of the net
assets acquired, goodwill of approximately $234 million was recorded.
Such goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25
years. The purchase price has been allocated as follows in thousands

ASTROTECH
The Company paid $201 million, including transaction costs,
to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain of the
liabilities of Astrotech. The purchase was effective on February 12,
1997. The business combination was accounted for using the purchase
method. The purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities
acquired based on estimates of fair value as of the date of
acquisition. Based on the allocation of the net assets acquired,
goodwill of approximately $35 million was recorded and is being
amortized on a straight line basis over twenty years.
6  LOANS PAYABLE UNDER CREDIT AGREEMENT
Prior to an August 1996 amendment, the Company credit
agreement consisted of a $65 million term loan bearing interest at 1
percent per month and a $55 million non-interest-bearing term loan
with several insurance companies. In addition, a revolving credit
commitment with a subcontractor and former shareholder provided a
maximum outstanding balance of $60 million and bore interest at a rate
of 1 percent per month.
In August 1996, the Company credit agreement was amended.
Under the amendment, the revolving credit commitment with a
subcontractor and former shareholder was canceled. In exchange for the
full satisfaction of the Company term loans with the various
insurance companies, the Company paid the insurance companies $25
million and agreed to pay an additional $20 million under a new
non-interest-bearing term loan. As of June 30, 1999, the remaining
balance due under the term loan is due in installments of $033 million
on each of August 1, 1999, 2000 and 2001. As a result of this amended
and restated agreement, the Company recognized an extraordinary gain of
$33 million, net of income taxes and other related expenses of $08
million and $01 million, respectively, during the year ended June 30,
1997.
In conjunction with a payment of certain principal of notes
payable due to Alenia Spazio S.p.A. in December 1998, see note 7, the
annual interest rate on the outstanding balances was amended to be at
825 percent per year. Aggregate interest cost incurred on the debts
due under the various credit agreements was approximately $40 thousand
, $0 and $01 million for the years ended June 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997
respectively.
7  NOTES PAYABLE TO SHAREHOLDER
The Company issued subordinated notes for a portion of the
amount due to Alenia Spazio S.p.A. Alenia, a shareholder, under a
previously completed construction contract for the Company flight
modules. In December 1998, the Company amended its agreement with
Alenia Spazio S.p.A. relative to the subordinated notes payable with an
outstanding principal balance of $119 million due in August 2001. In
exchange for payment of $40 million of principal, Alenia agreed to
waive the interest payment due for the quarter ended December 31, 1998
and to reduce                    30
32
the annual interest rate on the subordinated notes from 12 to 10
percent on the outstanding balance as of January 1, 1999. In addition,
Alenia may elect to convert, in whole or part, the remaining principal
amount into SPACEHAB equity, on terms and conditions to be agreed with
SPACEHAB.
The subordinated notes had aggregate outstanding balances of
$79 million and $119 million at June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The notes currently bear interest at an annual rate of 10 percent. No
amount of principal or accrued interest on the notes is due until all
amounts under the amended and restated credit agreement due to the
various insurance companies note 6 are repaid. As such, all principal
payments are due under these notes on August 1, 2001. However, during
fiscal 1998, the Company began paying interest quarterly. The Company
paid $04 million of interest during the year ended June 30, 1999 and
intends to continue to pay interest quarterly.
Interest cost converted to additional principal on the notes to
Alenia was approximately $0 and $07 million for the years ended June
30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
8  OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT
CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE
On August 12, 1992, the Company issued a subordinated promissory
note to an investment bank in the amount of $09 million, carrying
interest at LIBOR plus 3 percent, and maturing six months after the
payment of all other indebtedness due under the amended and restated
credit agreement and the subordinated notes to Alenia. The note was
convertible at the option of the holder into 75,000 shares of the
Company common stock at any time prior to maturity. On October 25,
1996, the investment bank exercised its option to convert the note into
the Company common stock.
CREDIT FACILITIES
On June 16, 1997, the Company entered into a $100 million line
of credit agreement with a financial institution. Outstanding balances
on the line of credit accrue interest at either the lender prime rate
or a LIBOR-based rate. Certain assets of the Company collateralize this
loan. The term of the agreement is through October 1999. Through June
30, 1999, the Company has not drawn against the line of credit.
On July 14, 1997, the Company subsidiary, Astrotech, entered
into another credit facility for loans of up to $150 million with a
financial institution. The term of the agreement is through July 13,
2002. This loan is collateralized by the assets of Astrotech and
certain other assets of the Company, and is guaranteed by the Company.
Interest accrues at LIBOR plus three percent. Principal and interest
are payable on a quarterly basis. In April 1999, the Company borrowed
an additional $10 million under this credit facility with the same
terms, conditions and expiration date of the original loan. Principal
payments of $31 million are due in FY 2000, 2001, and 2002 and
principal payments of $08 million are due in FY 2003. At June 30,
1999, the Company had an outstanding balance of $102 million under
this credit facility and accrued interest of $02 million.
COVENANT CHANGES
For the period ended June 30, 1999, the Company was in breach of
certain loan covenants of the term loan and line of credit facility.
The covenants had been negotiated prior to the acquisition of JE. While
the Company had not drawn against the line of credit, covenant waivers
were requested and received, for the year ended June 30, 1999, from
both lending institutions. The Company believes it will be in
compliance with the covenants on a going forward basis.                    31
33
CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES
In October 1997, the Company completed a private placement
offering for $633 million of aggregate principal of unsecured 8
percent Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007. Interest is payable
semi-annually. The notes are convertible into the common stock of the
Company at a rate of $13625 per share. This offering provided the
Company with net proceeds of approximately $599 million to be used for
capital expenditures associated with the development and construction
of space related assets and for other general corporate purposes.
9  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated
fair values of the Company financial instruments as of June 30, 1999
and 1998 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments in

The fair value of the Company long-term debt is based on quoted
market price or is estimated based on the current rates offered to the
Company for debt of similar remaining maturities and other terms. The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair market
value because of the relatively short duration of these instruments.
10  NASA CONTRACTS
MIR SPACE STATION CONTRACT
On July 14, 1995, NASA and the Company completed final
negotiations to provide the Company flight modules and related
integration services over four missions to the Russian Space Station
Mir. The contract was subsequently amended which resulted in a total
contract value of $915 million and the addition of three missions.
During the years ended June 30, 1998 and 1997, the Company
recognized $390 million and $417 million, respectively, of revenue
under the Mir contract. Work under the Mir contract, as amended, was
completed with its final mission in June 1998.
RESEARCH AND LOGISTICS MODULE SERVICES CONTRACT
On December 21, 1997, the Company entered into the Research and
Logistics Module Services REALMS Contract to provide to NASA its
flight modules and related integration services over three missions at
an aggregate fixed price of $449 million. This contract provides for
NASA to use the flight modules for both science and logistics missions.
During 1999, NASA                    32
34
exercised an additional option mission and change orders thereby
increasing the contract value to $682 million.
During the years ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, the Company
recognized $282 million and $143 million of revenue, respectively,
under this contract.
FLIGHT CREW SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT FCSD
JE primarily operates under NASA FCSD Contract which is
currently a $3263 million multi task cost plus-award and incentive fee
contract. The contract commenced in May 1993 and will conclude in April
2001. NASA has the option to exercise a one year extension. JE performs
several critical services for NASA including flight crew support
services, operations, training and fabrication of mockups at NASA
Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory and at NASA Space Vehicle Mockup
Facility, where astronauts train for both Space Shuttle and ISS
missions. JE also designs and fabricates flight hardware, such as
flight crew equipment and crew quarters habitability outfitting as well
as providing stowage integration services. JE is also responsible for
configuration management of the ISS.
11  STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
On March 26, 1999, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan designed to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent
a potential acquirer from gaining control of the Company without
offering a fair price to all of the Company stockholders. A dividend
of one preferred share purchase right a Right was declared on every
share of Common Stock outstanding on April 9, 1999. Each Right under
the Plan entitles the holder to buy one one-thousandth of a share of a
new series of junior participating preferred stock for $35. If any
person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of
common stock with certain limited exceptions, then each Right not
owned by the 15 percent stockholder will then entitle its holder to
purchase, at the Right then current exercise price, common shares
having a market value of twice the exercise price. In addition, if
after any person has become a 15 percent stockholder, and is involved
in a merger or other business combination transaction with another
person, each Right will entitle its holder other than the 15 percent
stockholder to purchase, at the Right then current exercise price,
common shares of the acquiring company having a value of twice the
Right then current exercise price. The rights were granted to each
shareholder of record on April 9, 1999. At any time before a person or
group acquires a 15% position, SPACEHAB generally will be entitled to
redeem the Rights at a redemption price of $001 per Right. The Rights
will expire on April 9, 2009.
12   COMMON STOCK OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS
NON-QUALIFIED OPTIONS
Non-qualified options are granted at the sole discretion of the
Board of directors. Prior to the adoption of the 1994 Stock Incentive
Plan the 1994 Plan, stock options granted to the Company officers
and employees were part of their employment contract or offer. The
number and price of the options granted was defined in the employment
agreements and such options vest incrementally over a period of four
years and generally expire within ten years of the date of grant.
300,000 options were granted in fiscal year 1999 in connection with the
acquisition of JE.
THE 1994 PLAN
Under the terms of the 1994 Plan, the number and price of the
options granted to employees is determined by the Board of Directors
and such options vest, in most cases, incrementally over a period of
four years and expire no more than ten years after the date of grant.                    33
35
THE DIRECTORS' STOCK OPTION PLAN
Prior to an amendment on October 21, 1997, each nonemployee
member of the Board of Directors was annually granted options to
purchase 5,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices equal to the
fair market value on the date of grant. Subsequent to the amendment,
each nonemployee member of the Board of Directors received a one-time
grant of an option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock. Further,
each new nonemployee director after the amendment date shall receive a
one-time grant of an option to purchase 10,000 shares. In addition,
effective as of the date of each annual meeting of the Company
stockholders on or after the effective date, each nonemployee director
who is elected or continues as a member of the Board of Directors of
the Company shall be awarded an option to purchase 5,000 shares of
common stock. Options under the Director Plan vest after one year and
expire seven years from the date of grant.
1997 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
During the year ended June 30, 1998, the Company adopted an
employee stock purchase plan that permits eligible employees to
purchase shares of common stock of the Company at prices no less than
85 percent of the current market price. Eligible employees may elect to
participate in the plan by authorizing payroll deductions from one
percent to ten percent of gross compensation for each payroll period.
On the last day of each quarter, each participant contribution
account is used to purchase the maximum number of whole and fractional
shares of common stock determined by dividing the contribution
account balance by the lesser of 85 percent of the price of a share
of common stock on the first day of the quarter or the last day of a
quarter. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be
purchased under the plan is 1,500,000. Through June 30, 1999, 73,614
shares have been issued under the plan.                    34

The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations
in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, as all options have been
granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value as of the
date of grant, no compensation cost has been recognized under these
plans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Had
compensation cost been determined consistent with Statement 123, the
Company net income and earnings per common share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands, except
per share data                                   Years ended June 30,

The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions used for grants in fiscal years
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively: 00 percent dividend growth;
expected volatility ranging from 35 percent to 40 percent; risk-free
interest rates ranging from 568 percent to 671 percent; and expected
lives ranging from three to seven years.
The effects of compensation cost as determined under Statement
123 on net income in fiscal years 1999, 1998 and 1997 may not be
representative of the effects on pro forma net income in future
periods.                    36

WARRANTS
The Company also has 53,000 currently exercisable warrants
outstanding to purchase the Company common stock at $900 per share,
with an expiration date of June 2002. The fair market value of these
warrants was recognized at issuance. All such warrants were issued at
exercise prices equivalent to, or in excess of, the determined fair
market value of the Company common stock at the date of issuance.

Net deferred tax liabilities                  $ 2,842     $ 2,527
As of June 30, 1998, current deferred tax assets of $151,000 are
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
accompanying balance sheet.
The net changes in the total valuation allowance for the years
ended June 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were an increase of $02 million and
decreases of $47 million and $21 million, respectively.
At June 30, 1999, the Company had accumulated net operating
losses of $197 million available to offset future regular taxable
income. These operating loss carryforwards expire between the years
2007 and 2019. Utilization of these net operating losses may be subject
to limitations in the event of significant changes in stock ownership
of the Company.
Additionally, the Company has approximately $22 million and $33
million of research and experimentation and alternative minimum tax
credit carryforwards, respectively, available to offset future regular
tax liabilities. The research and experimentation credits expire
between the years 2000 and 2008; the alternative minimum tax credits
carryforward indefinitely.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets are realizable. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected
future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. Based upon the level of projected future regular taxable
income over the periods, which the deferred tax assets are deductible,
management believes that the Company will realize the benefits of these
deductions. As of June 30, 1999, the Company provided a valuation
allowance of $169 thousand against deferred tax assets. The amount of
the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be
reduced if estimates of future regular taxable income during the
carryforward period are reduced.                    38

14  NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
In December 1997, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings
Per Share, which established new guidelines for the calculations of
earnings loss per share. Earnings loss per share for all prior
periods have been restated to reflect the provisions of this Statement.

common stock, at prices ranging from $750 to $2400 per share were
outstanding for the years ended June 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
These were not included in the computations of diluted earnings per
share because the options' and warrants' exercise prices were greater
than the average market price of the common shares during the years
ended June 30, 1998 and 1997.
All options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock were
excluded from the computations of diluted earnings loss per share for
the year ended June 30, 1999, because the impact of such options and
warrants is anti-dilutive.  15  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan, which
covers all employees and officers. For the years ended June 30, 1999,
1998 and 1997, the Company contributed $08 million, $01 million and
$01 million, respectively, to the plan. The Company has the right, but
not the obligation, to make contributions to the plan in future years
at the discretion of the Company Board of Directors.                    39

16  COMMITMENTS
INTEGRATION AND OPERATIONS CONTRACTS
On August 13, 1997, the Company initiated a letter agreement
with The Boeing Company, a major subcontractor, for standard
integration and operation services to the Company for future missions
that were not already provided for under its contract for missions to
the Mir Space Station. In August 1998, this letter agreement became a
cost plus incentive fee contract whereby Boeing will provide
integration and operations services required to successfully complete
four research missions one single module mission and three double
module missions and five logistics double module missions.
Additionally, there are several tasks that are separately priced to
yield a contract value of up to $423 million. As of June 30, 1999,
$162 million has been incurred under this commitment.
MODULE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS
During fiscal year 1997, the Company entered into a $368
million cost-plus-fee contract with Boeing to construct a new research
module with associated double module hardware. The Company has taken
initial delivery of the module and is in the process of completing its
construction which is expected to be completed in the middle of fiscal
year 2000. The Company has incurred approximately $329 million in
construction costs through June 30, 1999.
During FY 1999, the Company entered into a $46 million letter
agreement with Boeing to initiate activities to support the fabrication
of a double docking module. The letter contract period of performance
is through August 1999. The Company plans to extend the letter
agreement. The Company has incurred $10 million in costs through June
30, 1999.
JOINT VENTURE
During June 1998, the Company entered into a joint venture
agreement with Guigne Technologies Limited for the purpose of
developing, fabricating, marketing and sales of SpaceDRUMSTM
services. In accordance with the joint venture agreement, the Company
has agreed to contribute, in exchange for a 50 percent interest in
SpaceDRUMSTM, an aggregate of $20 million of working capital to the

satellite manufacturing and launch services industry. Astrotech
currently provides launch site preparation of flight ready satellites
to major U.S. space launch companies and satellite manufacturers. JE,
acquired in July 1998, is primarily engaged in providing engineering
services and products to the Federal Government and NASA, primarily
under the Flight Crew Systems Development Contract FCSD. SPACEHAB was
founded to commercially develop space habitat modules to operate in the
cargo bay of the Space Shuttles. SPACEHAB provides access to the
modules and integration and integration and operations support services
for both NASA and commercial customers.
The Company chief operating decision maker utilizes both
revenue and income before taxes, including allocated interest based on
