To the Share Owners of APAC TeleServices, Inc.: 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of APAC TELESERVICES,

1995 and the related statements of income, share owners' equity and cash
flows for the three years ended December 29, 1996, December 31, 1995 and
January 1, 1995. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of APAC
TeleServices, Inc. as of December 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the three years ended

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies of APAC TeleServices, Inc. the Company
are as follows: 
a Fiscal Year. The Company has a 52/53 week fiscal year that ends on the
Sunday closest to December 31.
b Industry Information. The Company provides high volume telephone-based
sales, marketing and customer management solutions for corporate clients
operating in the telecommunications, insurance, financial services, parcel
delivery, utilities and entertainment industries throughout the United
States. The nature of the industry is such that the Company is dependent on
several large clients for a significant portion of its annual revenues. The
Company had two, two and one clients that each accounted for more than ten
percent of the Company net revenue for the fiscal years ended December 29,
1996, December 31, 1995 and January 1, 1995, respectively. For the periods
ended a December 29, 1996, such two clients accounted for 39% and 18% of
the Company net revenue, b December 31, 1995, such two clients accounted
for 16% and 14% of the Company net revenue, and c January 1, 1995, such
client accounted for 24% of the Company net revenues, respectively. The
loss of one or more of these major clients could have a materially adverse
effect on the Company business.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in
banks and overnight securities.
d Short-term Investments. The Company invests excess operating cash in
instruments with maturities of 12 months or less. The Company intends to hold
such investments, which may consist of short-term municipal preferred
securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury and Agency securities,
repurchase agreements and others, to maturity. At December 31, 1995, short-
term investments consisted of municipal preferred securities with maturities
of less than 50 days. The market value of such investments including
interest was equal to the original cost basis.
e Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized and charged to
expense through depreciation. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
as incurred. Upon sale or retirement, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is recorded
in the statement of income. Depreciation is determined using the straight-
line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for
income tax reporting purposes over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or the
lease term. 
f Capitalized Software Costs. The Company capitalizes the cost of third-
party computer software purchased for internal use and costs related to the
installation of such software. These costs are amortized over their
estimated useful life of approximately five years.
The Company also capitalizes certain software costs incurred while providing
services to its customers in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Costs associated with the
planning and design phase of the software development, including coding and
testing activities necessary to establish technological feasibility, are
expenses as incurred. Once technological feasibility has been determined,
additional costs incurred in development, including coding, testing and
product quality assurance, are capitalized when material. During the year
ended December 29, 1996, the Company capitalized approximately $1,280,000 of
such costs, which are amortized over the period in which revenues directly
attributable to such costs are expected to be generated.
g Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue on programs as
services are performed for its clients, generally based upon hours incurred.
h Deferred Preoperating Costs. The Company has entered into contracts to
provide telephone-based services for periods of up to five years. The
Company has incurred preoperating costs directly associated with these
contracts. Preoperating costs include payroll and other costs associated
with hiring and training new personnel dedicated to providing service under
the contracts during their term. The costs are amortized over a 12-month
period beginning on the date the facility to which they relate is staffed and
ready for operation.
i Concentration of Credit Risk. Concentration of credit risk is limited
to trade accounts receivable and is subject to the financial conditions of
certain major clients described in Industry Information above. The Company
does not require collateral or other security to support clients'
receivables. The Company conducts periodic reviews of its clients' financial
conditions and vendor payment practices to minimize collection risks on trade
accounts receivable.
j Management Estimates. Management has made certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent liabilities during the preparation of the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
However, management does not believe they would have a material effect on
operating results.
k Net Income Per Share. Pro forma and actual net income per share amounts
are computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and
common share equivalents outstanding during each period presented after
retroactive adjustments for stock splits and all stock options granted within
one year of the Company inial public offering. Supplementary pro forma net
income per common share and common share equivalents would not have been
materially different than that reflected on the accompanying statements of
income for the year ended December 31, 1995.
l Training costs. The Company maintains ongoing training programs for its
employees. The cost of this training is expenses as incurred. In addition,
certain contracts require clients to reimburse the Company for specific
training. These costs are billed to clients as incurred.
m Accounting of Stock-Based Compensation. The Company currently utilizes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 in its accounting for stock
options. In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 Statement 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The accounting method as provided
in the pronouncement is not required to be adopted; however, it is
encouraged. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
Statement No. 123. 2. INCOME TAXES 
Prior to the initial public offering of the Company common shares
completed on October 16, 1995, the Company included its income and expenses
with those of its share owners for Federal and certain state income tax
purposes an S Corporation election. Accordingly, the statements of income
for the fiscal year ended January 1, 1995 did not include a provision for
Federal income taxes. In connection with the Company initial public
offering in October 1995, the Company terminated its S Corporation election
and accordingly recorded a deferred income tax liability and corresponding
income tax expense of $3,780,000, arising from a change in the Company tax
status and a change from the cash basis to the accrual basis of accounting
for income tax purposes. Beginning October 16, 1995, the Company provides
for deferred income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting. 
This method requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the
tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax
rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and
liabilities.
In connection with the initial public offering, the Company and certain of
its share owners entered into a tax agreement. The agreement provides that
the Company will indemnify such share owners against additional income taxes
resulting from adjustments made as determined by an appropriate tax
authority to the taxable income reported by the Company as an S Corporation
for the periods prior to the initial public offering, but only to the extent
those adjustments result in a decrease in income taxes otherwise payable by
the Company.
The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 29, 1996 and
December 31, 1995 consists of the following:                            1996      1995
Current:
Federal                   $15,772,000  $  920,000

and actual effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 1995,
is as follows:                                          1995

tax purposes for all periods presented.
The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as
of December 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995 are as follows                                      1996     1995

and December 31, 1995 has been recorded as the Company believes it is more
likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. 3. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
At December 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995, property and equipment along
with corresponding estimated useful lives consist of the following                                              ESTIMATED
1996       1995      LIFE

included above is $4,426,032 at December 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995.
At December 29, 1996, the Company had fixed asset purchase commitments of
approximately $4,800,000 related to investments in Customer Contact Centers.
The Company reviews intangible assets and other long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts
may not be recoverable. To date, no such events or changes in circumstances
have occurred. If such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company
will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset or acquired business are less than
the carrying value of the related asset. The impairment loss would adjust
the asset to its fair value. 4. DEBT 
In June 1996, the Company entered into a new unsecured line-of-credit
facilities agreement the Credit Facility with a syndicate of banks, and
terminated all prior line-of-credit facilities. The Company has two separate
line-of-credit facilities in place. The credit lines consist of a revolving
facility of $20,000,000 the Revolving Facility and a $20,000,000
revolving credit facility which may be converted into a term loan the
Convertible Revolving Facility. As of December 29, 1996, the Company had
borrowings totaling $15,900,000 under the Credit Facility, which the Company
has classified as current indebtedness, as amounts outstanding fluctuate
based upon the working capital position of the Company. The effective
interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility was 825%
at December 29, 1996.
The Revolving Facility matures in May 1999, with two one-year renewal
options which are subject to the lender acceptance. At December 29, 1996,
the Company had $14,100,000 of unused availability under the Revolving
Facility.
The Convertible Revolving Facility expires in May 2000, unless converted to
a term loan. At any time during the term of the Convertible Revolving
Facility, the Company may elect to convert all or part of the outstanding
draws into a term loan which matures in quarterly installments beginning on
the last day of the calendar quarter during which the term loan was made and
terminates the earlier of the third anniversary of the relevant commencement
date or May 31, 2001. The minimum amount which can be converted at any one
time is $1,000,000. As of December 29, 1996, the Company had $10,000,000 of
unused availability under the Convertible Revolving Facility and has not
elected to convert any of the outstanding balance under this facility to a
term loan.
The Company has several interest rate options available under the Credit
Facility. The options include a domestic rate, an adjusted LIBOR rate, a
treasury rate and a fixed rate. The actual interest rate charged is based on
the existing market rate at the time the rate is selected by the Company,
plus a specified level of basis points, depending on the maintenance of
certain financial covenants. At December 29, 1996, the Company effective
borrowing rate using the adjusted LIBOR rate would have been 56%. The
Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants, and is
restricted in its ability to pay dividends on common shares under terms of
the Credit Facility. At December 29, 1996, the Company was in compliance
with all financial covenants.
In August 1995, the Company refinanced its line-of-credit facilities with a
syndicate of banks. Proceeds from refinancing were used to retire
outstanding credit facilities in the amount of $11,787,520. At December 31,
1995, the Company had no borrowings under these lines of credit. Long-term debt at December 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995 consists of the
following:                                           1996     1995  
Industrial Revenue Bonds, collateralized by a building, payable in varying
monthly installments through June 2008, bearing interest at 70%
adjustable semiannually thereafter to 71% of the average yield rate of U.S.
Treasury Bonds with a floor of 70% 70% in 1996 and 1995         $ 1,397,974  $ 1,466,412
Capital lease obligations, secured by related equipment, payable in varying
monthly installments through 1998, with a weighted average interest rate of

The Company leases its Customer Contact Centers and administrative offices. 
Rent expense for the fiscal years ended December 29, 1996, December 31, 1995
and January 1, 1995 was $3,186,855, $1,567,493 and $1,011,185, respectively. 
Minimum future rental payments at December 29, 1996 are as follows

Total                $10,038,283 6. SHARE OWNERS' EQUITY 
Effective March 31, 1994, the Company authorized and issued a 60,000-for-1
stock split of common shares. On September 8, 1995, the Company completed a
33-for-1 stock split. On May 15, 1996, the Company completed a 2-for-1
stock split in the form of a stock dividend. All per share information
included in these financial statements has been adjusted to reflect these
splits retroactively.
On October 16, 1995, the Company issued 6,600,000 common shares in
connection with an initial public offering. 
At December 29, 1996, the Company had reserved 5,915,034 common shares for
issuance in connection with the exercise of stock options or purchases under
the Company employee stock purchase plan.
As of December 31, 1995, the Company had accrued distributions of
$2,809,000, based upon the undistributed taxable income attributable to the
Company tax status as an S Corporation prior to the initial public
offering. These distributions were paid in fiscal 1996 to the Company S
Corporation share owners of record prior to its initial public offering upon
the Company filing of its corporate income tax returns.
7. STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has granted options to purchase common shares under several
plans. In 1995, the Company adopted an Incentive Stock Plan and a Nonemployee
Director Stock Option Plan. Officers, key employees and non-employee
consultants may be granted non-qualified stock options, incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and stock awards under
the Incentive Stock Plan. A committee of the Board of Directors administers
the Incentive Stock Plan and is authorized to determine the key employees to
whom, and the times at which, the options and other benefits are to be
granted, the number of shares subject to each option, the applicable vesting
schedule, and the exercise price provided that the exercise price may not be
less than 100% and 85% of the fair market value of the common shares at the
date of grant for incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options,
respectively. The Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan provides for annual
grants of non-qualified stock options to each non-affiliated director of the
Company. The option will allow such directors to purchase 5,000 common
shares at an amount equal to the fair market value of the common shares on
the date of grant. These options vest equally over a three year period.
Options under both plans expire at periods between ten and fifteen years
after issuance.
On May 26, 1995, the Company granted an officer an option to purchase
565,034 common shares at an aggregate price of $1,764,705, with an average
exercise price of $312 per share. Upon sale of all or substantially all of
its assets or stock prior to May 1998, the officer has the right to sell this
option back to the Company for an amount determined with reference to the
amount received in such sale. The option vests 20% on May 31 of each year
through 2000 and has a term of 10 years. The weighted average fair value of
this option at the date of grant was $183 per share, based upon the
assumptions described below using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. At
December 29, 1996, 113,007 of these options were vested.
Stock option activity for the Company stock options plans for the years
ended December 29, 1996, and December 31, 1995, is as follows                           INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN

Had the Company accounted for its stock options in accordance with Statement
123, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share would have been
approximately $29,830,000 and $063 In 1996, and $7,310,000 and $018 In
1995, respectively. The pro forma disclosure is not likely to be indicative
of pro forma results which may be expected in future years because of the
fact that options vest over several years, compensation expense is recognized
as the options vest and additional awards may also be granted. 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
At December 29, 1996 and December 31, 1995, the Company had guaranteed the
repayment of approximately $773,000 and $974,000, respectively, of the
remaining outstanding community college bond obligations, which were issued
in connection with various job training agreements. At December 29, 1996,
the Company estimates that the deposits made into escrow will be adequate to
cover the cost of the maturing bonds. 9. BENEFIT PLANS
In October 1995, the Company adopted a 401k savings plan. Employees
meeting certain eligibility requirements, as defined, may contribute up to
15% of pretax gross wages, subject to certain restrictions. The Company
makes matching contributions of 25% of the first 6% of employee wages
contributed to the plan. Company matching contributions vest 20% per year
over a five year period. For the years ended December 29, 1996 and December
31, 1995 the Company made matching contributions of approximately $102,000
and $16,000 to the plan, respectively.
In 1996, share owners of the Company adopted an employee stock purchase
plan. The plan is administered by the compensation committee and permits
eligible employees to purchase an aggregate of 600,000 common shares at 85%
of the lesser of the current market closing price of the Company common
shares at the beginning or end of a quarter. Employees may annually purchase
common shares up to the lesser of 15% of their gross wages or $25,000. 
During 1996, 12,059 common shares were issued to employees under this plan. 10. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
The Company paid distributions in the amount of $2,809,000 in 1996 to its S
Corporation share owners of record prior to the Company initial public
offering. Such payment related to share owner tax obligations and
undistributed S Corporation taxable income.
Several share owners of the Company sold an aggregate of 6,770,000 and
4,600,000 common shares in February 1996 and October 1996, respectively, in
an underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration rights agreement
which was entered into by the Company and such share owners prior to the
Company initial public offering. Costs of the February 1996 offering
totalling $360,000 have been included as selling, general and administrative
expense during the year ended December 29, 1996. The selling share owners of
the October 1996 public offering have agreed to reimburse the Company for
costs it incurred on their behalf. At December 29, 1996, the Company has a
receivable from these share owners totaling $300,000. 11. BUSINESS COMBINATION
In January 1996, the Company hired The Shechtman Group, a management
consulting firm, to provide leadership consulting services. On November 29,
1996, the Company issued 54,440 common shares in exchange for a 100% equity
interest in The Shechtman Group. This transaction has been accounted for as
a pooling of interests. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
The chief executive officer and managing director of The Shechtman Group is
also a director of the Company. 12. QUARTERLY DATA UNAUDITED                     First     Second     Third     Fourth      Full
