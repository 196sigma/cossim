To Manhattan Associates, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MANHATTAN
ASSOCIATES, INC. a Georgia corporation AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31,
2000 and 2001 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Manhattan Associates, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

DECEMBER 31, 1999, 2000 AND 2001
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
Manhattan Associates, Inc. Manhattan or the Company is a provider of
technology-based solutions to improve supply chain effectiveness and
efficiencies within the extended supply chain. The Company solutions are
designed to optimize the receipt, storage, assembly and distribution of
inventory and the management of equipment and personnel within a distribution
center, and to enhance collaboration between the distribution center and its
trading partners. The Company solutions consist of software, including, a
comprehensive suite of robust and modular software products; services, including
design, configuration, implementation and training services, plus customer
support services and software enhancements subscriptions; and hardware.
The Company operations are principally in North America and Europe. Its
European operations are conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Manhattan Associates, Ltd and Manhattan Associates Europe, B.V. in the United
Kingdom and the Netherlands, respectively. The Company occasionally sells its
products in other regions, such as Australia, Latin America and the Far East
through its direct sales channel as well as various reseller channels.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into
United States dollars in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52 Foreign
Currency Translation. Revenues from international customers were denominated in
the respective local currencies and translated using the average monthly
exchange rates for the year. The effect on the statements of operations related
to transaction gains and losses is insignificant for all years presented. All
balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect
at the balance sheet date and the effect of changes in exchange rates from year
to year is insignificant.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and
cash equivalents and short-term investments with two financial institutions. The
Company sales are primarily to companies located in the United States and
Europe. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and does not require collateral. Accounts receivable are due
principally from large U.S. companies under stated contract terms. The Company
provides for estimated credit losses at the time of sale.
Our top five customers in aggregate accounted for 21%, 22% and 10% of total
revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively. Sales to one customer the significant customer accounted for
approximately 10% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001. Most of
45
MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
the revenue from the significant customer in 2001 arose from purchases of
hardware. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2000 or
1999. Accounts receivable from the significant customer on December 31, 2001 was
approximately $43 million. On January 22, 2002, the significant customer for
2001 filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
As a result of the filing, the uncertainties around the bankruptcy proceedings
and the ultimate timing of payment, we recorded an allowance of $43 million in
2001 to effectively defer revenues arising in the fourth quarter of 2001 from
the significant customer, but unpaid at the time of the bankruptcy declaration.
The allowance includes approximately $23 million of software fees, $16 million
of fees for professional services and $04 million of hardware. Additionally, we
billed the significant customer approximately $09 million for professional
services during January 2002 prior to the Chapter 11 filing. These accounts
receivable will be evaluated for collectibility in the first quarter of 2002.
Marketable Securities
The Company investment in marketable securities consists of debt
instruments of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies and corporate
commercial paper. These investments are categorized as available-for-sale
securities and recorded at fair market value, as defined by SFAS No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Unrealized
holding gains and losses are reflected as a net amount in a separate component
of shareholders' equity until realized. For the purposes of computing realized
gains and losses, cost is identified on a specific identification basis. At
December 31, 2000 and 2001, the cumulative unrealized gain on short-term
investments was $4,000 and $73,000, respectively. The following is a summary of
the available-for-sale securities in thousands                                   DECEMBER 31,

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and
other financial instruments included in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets approximate their fair values principally due to the short-term
maturities of these instruments.
Risks Associated with Single Business Line, Technological Advances, and
Hardware Revenue
The Company currently derives a substantial portion its revenues from sales
of its software and related services and hardware. Any factor adversely
affecting the markets for distribution management center
46
MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
solutions could have an adverse effect on the Company business, financial
condition, and results of operations.
The markets for supply chain collaboration and distribution center
management solutions are subject to rapid technological change, changing
customer needs, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry
standards that may render existing products and services obsolete. As a result,
the Company position in these markets could be eroded rapidly by unforeseen
changes in customer requirements for application features, functions, and
technologies. The Company growth and future operating results will depend, in
part, upon its ability to enhance existing applications and develop and
introduce new applications that meet changing customer requirements, that
respond to competitive products and that achieve market acceptance.
The Company resells a variety of hardware products developed and
manufactured by third parties. Revenue from such hardware sales can amount to a
significant portion of the Company total revenue in any period. As the market
for distribution of hardware products becomes more competitive, the Company
customers may find it attractive to purchase such hardware directly from the
manufacturer of such products, with a resultant decrease in the Company
revenues from hardware.
Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue consists of revenues from the licensing of software;
fees from consulting, implementation and training services collectively,
professional services, plus customer support services and software upgrades;
and sales of complementary radio frequency and computer equipment.
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Position No.
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended by Statement of
Position No. 98-9, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions SOP 98-9. Under SOP 97-2, the Company recognizes software
license revenue when the following criteria are met: 1 a signed contract is
obtained; 2 delivery of the product has occurred; 3 the license fee is fixed
or determinable; 4 collectibility is probable; and 5 remaining obligations
under the license agreement are insignificant. SOP 98-9 requires recognition of
revenue using the residual method when 1 there is vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple-element
arrangement that is not accounted for using long-term contract accounting; 2
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more
of the delivered elements in the arrangement; and 3 all revenue-recognition
criteria in SOP 97-2 other than the requirement for vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement are
satisfied. SOP 98-9 was effective for transactions entered into after March 15,
1999, and the Company adopted the residual method for such arrangements at that
time. For those contracts that contain significant future obligations, license
revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method.
The Company services revenue consists of fees generated from professional
services, customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions
related to the Company software products. Professional services are typically
contracted for under separate service agreements. Fees from professional
services performed by the Company are generally billed on an hourly basis, and
revenue is recognized as the services are performed. Professional services are
sometimes rendered under fixed-fee based contracts, but only in instances when
the scope of the project is reasonably quantifiable. Revenue related to
fixed-fee based contracts is recognized on a percent complete basis based on the
hours incurred. Revenue related to customer support services and software
enhancement subscriptions are generally paid in advance and recognized ratably
over the term of the agreement, typically 12 months.
Hardware revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware
products, developed and manufactured by third parties, that are integrated with
and complementary to the Company software solutions. As part of a complete
x-SCE solution the Company customers frequently purchase hardware from
47
MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
the Company in conjunction with the licensing of software. These products
include computer hardware, radio frequency terminals networks, bar code printers
and scanners, and other peripherals. Hardware revenue is recognized upon
shipment to the customer. The Company generally purchases hardware from its
vendors only after receiving an order from a customer. As a result, the Company
does not maintain significant hardware inventory.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue represents amounts collected prior to complete performance
of professional services, customer support services and software enhancement
subscriptions and significant obligations under license agreements. The Company
expects to complete such services or obligations within the next twelve months.
Returns and Allowances
The Company has not experienced significant returns or warranty claims to
date and, as a result, has not recorded a provision for the cost of returns and
product warranty claims at December 31, 2000 or 2001.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment consists of furniture, computers, other office
equipment, purchased software for internal use, and leasehold improvements
recorded at cost. The Company depreciates the cost of furniture, computers,
other office equipment, purchased software and web site development on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives three years for computer
equipment and software, five years for office equipment, seven years for
furniture. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of its useful
life or the term of the lease. Included in computer equipment and software is a
capital lease of approximately $670,000 and $447,000, net of depreciation, as of
December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense
for property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001
was approximately $3,213,000, $4,315,000 and $5,719,000, respectively, and was
included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements
of income.
Property and equipment, at cost, consist of the following in thousands                                 DECEMBER 31,

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include acquired software, goodwill and capitalized
development costs. The assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
a period of 3 to 10 years. Total amortization expense related to goodwill and
acquired software was approximately $1,102,000, $1,165,000 and $5,240,000 for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, and is included
separately in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Total
amortization expense related to capitalized software development costs was
approximately $822,000, $620,000 and $406,000 for the years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, and is included in cost of software fees in
the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
During 1999, the Company expensed approximately $300,000 of capitalized software
development costs and approximately $495,000 of acquired software and goodwill
due to impairment of certain assets, respectively.
Intangible Assets consist of the following in thousands                                 DECEMBER 31,

Software Development Costs
Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred. The
Company determines the amount of development costs capitalizable under the
provisions of SFAS No. 86, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to Be
Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Computer software development costs are
charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is
established, after which remaining software production costs are capitalized in
accordance with SFAS No. 86. The Company has defined technological feasibility
as the point in time at which the Company has a detailed program design or a
working model of the related product, depending on the type of development
efforts. For the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company
capitalized approximately $909,000, $0 and $0 of internal research and
development costs. Amounts capitalized include salaries, other payroll-related
costs, contract labor and other direct expenses. During 2001, payments of
approximately $717,000 were made to an outside research and development
organization to internationalize PkMS into Japanese, German, French and Spanish.
The payments have been classified as Other Assets and will be amortized over a
three-year period beginning in January 2002.
Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
The Company periodically reviews the values assigned to long-lived assets,
including property and intangible assets, to determine whether events and
circumstances have occurred which indicate that the remaining estimated useful
lives may warrant revision or that the remaining balances may not be
recoverable. In such reviews, undiscounted cash flows associated with these
assets are compared with their carrying value to determine if a write-down to
fair value is required. Management believes the long-lived and intangible assets
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are fairly valued.
Segment Information
The Company operates in a single segment as defined by SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. See Note
9 for discussion of foreign operations.
Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share

Stock-Based Compensation Plan
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plan for stock issued
to employees under Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, accordingly, records deferred
compensation for options granted at an exercise price below the fair value of
the underlying stock. The deferred compensation is presented as a component of
equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is amortized over the
periods to be benefited, generally the vesting period of the options. Effective
in fiscal year 1996, the Company adopted the pro forma disclosure option for
stock-based compensation issued to employees of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.
Comprehensive Income
In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. This statement establishes the rules for the reporting of comprehensive
income and its components. The Company comprehensive income includes net
income, foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses
on short-term investments.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications were made to the prior years' financial
statements to conform to the 2001 presentation.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This Statement
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts,
collectively referred to as derivatives, and for hedging activities. It requires
that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. The
Company adopted the new statement on January 1, 2001. The adoption of this
Statement did not have a significant impact on the Company financial
statements.
In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities -- a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125. This
Statement revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other
transfers of financial assets and collateral. This statement is effective for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities
occurring after March 31, 2001. The adoption of this Statement did not have a
significant impact on the Company financial statements.
50
MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations. This Statement requires that the purchase method of
accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001
and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method. The adoption of this Statement
did not have a significant impact on the Company financial statements.
Also in July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This Statement requires that
goodwill and certain intangible assets, including those recorded in past
business combinations, no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be tested
for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January
1, 2002 and as a result, we will cease to amortize approximately $213 million
of goodwill during 2002. We had recorded approximately $30 million of
amortization on these amounts during 2001 and would have recorded approximately
$30 million of amortization during 2002. In lieu of amortization, we are
required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in 2002 and an
impairment review at least annually thereafter.
In November 2001, the FASB issued a Staff Announcement Topic D-103 Topic
D-103, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred. Topic D-103 establishes that reimbursements
received for out-of-pocket expenses should be reported as revenue in the
statement of operations. During 2001, we classified reimbursed out-of-pocket
expenses as a reduction of operating expenses. We adopted this guidance
effective January 1, 2002. Our adoption of Topic D-103 will result in increased
services revenue and increased costs of services revenue. Our results of
operations for prior periods will be reclassified to conform to the new
presentation. The total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to expense was
$40 million, $55 million and $51 million for 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. Our adoption of Topic D-103 will not affect our net income or loss
in any past or future periods.
2. INCOME TAXES
The Company is subject to future federal and state income taxes and has
recorded net deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the difference between the financial accounting and the tax
bases of assets and liabilities. Significant components of the Company
deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 are as
follows                                  DECEMBER 31,

$730,000, $13,522,000 and $9,049,000 for 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. As a
result of these income tax benefits, the Company has refundable income taxes of
$1,624,000 at December 31, 2001. The refundable income taxes represent refunds
to be received for taxes paid in 1998 and 1999.
As a result of the tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options,
the Company has federal net operating loss carry-forwards NOLs of
approximately $23,504,000 available to offset future income in those respective
taxing jurisdictions. The federal NOLs expire in 2021. The NOLs may be subject
to certain limitations in the event of a change in ownership. In addition, the
Company has $1,396,000 of research and development tax credit carryforwards that
expire in 2018 to 2021.

3. STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Manhattan Associates LLC Option Plan the LLC Option Plan became
effective on January 1, 1997. The LLC Option Plan is administered by a committee
appointed by the Board of Directors. The aggregate number of shares reserved for
issuance under the LLC Option Plan was 5,000,000 shares. The options are granted
at terms determined by the committee; however, the options cannot have a term
exceeding ten years. Options granted under the LLC Option Plan have vesting
periods ranging from immediately to six
52
MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
years. Subsequent to February 28, 1998, no additional options could be granted
pursuant to the LLC Option Plan.
Prior to the establishment of the LLC Option Plan, the Company issued
options to purchase 661,784 shares of common stock to certain employees. These
grants contain provisions similar to options issued under the LLC Option Plan.
The Company 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan was
adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by the shareholders in February
1998. The Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock
options. Optionees have the right to purchase a specified number of shares of
common stock at a specified option price and subject to such terms and
conditions as are specified in connection with the option grant. The Stock
Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. The committee has the authority to adopt, amend and repeal the
administrative rules, guidelines and practices relating to the Stock Incentive
Plan generally and to interpret the provisions thereof. Options granted under
the Stock Incentive Plan cannot have a term exceeding ten years and typically
vest over a period of three to six years.
As of December 31, 2001, the Stock Incentive Plan provides for issuance of
up to 10,659,453 shares of common stock subject to adjustment in the event of
stock splits and other similar events, less the number of shares issued under
the LLC Option Plan, in the form of stock options and other stock incentives.
The number of shares available for issuance under the Plan is automatically
adjusted, without shareholder approval, on the first day of each fiscal year,
beginning with the 2000 fiscal year, by a number of shares such that the total
number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan equals the sum of i the
aggregate number of shares previously issued under the Plan and the Manhattan
Associates, LLC Option Plan; ii the aggregate number of shares subject to then
outstanding stock incentives granted under the Plan and the Manhattan
Associates, LLC Option Plan; and iii 5% of the number of shares of common
stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year. However, no more
than 1,000,000 of the shares available for grant each year shall be available
for issuance pursuant to incentive stock options, and no more than 10,000,000
shares resulting from such automatic adjustments may ever be issued during the
term of the Plan.

The Company recorded deferred compensation of $580,000 on options granted
during 1998, as the exercise price was less than the deemed fair value of the
underlying common stock. The Company amortizes deferred compensation over a
period not to exceed six years. The Company recognized compensation expense of
$148,000, $85,000 and $82,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and
2001, respectively, and had deferred compensation expense of $193,000 and
$105,000 at December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is
required by SFAS No. 123, which also requires that the information be determined
as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock option grants under the
fair value method required by SFAS No. 123. The fair value of each option grant
has been estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option

vesting period of the options.
The weighted average fair market values of options at the date of grant for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $590, $3307 and $2237,
respectively.
