29 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
CENTRAL PARKING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Central
Parking Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1999 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended September 30, 2000. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. Separate
financial statements of Allright Holdings, Inc. also included in the 1998
restated consolidated financial statements were audited by other auditors whose
report dated October 9, 1998, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
statements and referred to a business combination effective October 31, 1996
which resulted in new basis of accounting for the assets and liabilities of
Allright Holdings, Inc., the successor company. Our opinion, insofar as it
relates to the amounts included for Allright Holdings, Inc., is based solely on
the report of the other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other
auditors, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Central Parking
Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1999 and 2000, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended September 30, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

35 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the
preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows     A ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Central Parking Corporation CPC is a United States company
chartered in the State of Tennessee. The consolidated financial statements
include accounts of Central Parking Corporation and its subsidiaries the
Company or Central Parking including Central Parking System, Inc. CPS
and its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries; Kinney System Holdings, Inc. and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries Kinney; Central Parking System of the United
Kingdom, Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiary CPS-UK; Central Parking System
Realty, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Realty; Allright Holdings,
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Allright, including Edison Parking
Management, L.P. Edison, a 50% owned partnership under Allright control. The
results of operations of the remaining 50% of Edison are eliminated as a
minority interest. Central Parking Finance Trust was established during the year
ended September 30, 1998. All significant inter-company transactions have been
eliminated.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated
to reflect the impact of the merger between Central Parking and Allright, which
was consummated on March 19, 1999. The transaction constituted a tax-free
reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests under
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 16. Business Combinations.
Accordingly, Central Parking financial statements have been restated to
reflect the combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows of
Central Parking and Allright as if Allright had been part of Central Parking
since Allright inception date of October 31, 1996. Prior to the consummation
of the merger, Allright fiscal year end was June 30. In recording the merger,
Allright historical consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended June 30, 1998, have been combined with the Company consolidated
financial statements as of and for the Company fiscal years ended 1998. As a
result of conforming Allright fiscal year with that of the Company, the
historical results of operations of Allright for the three-month period ended
September 30, 1998 have been recorded directly to the Company consolidated
shareholders' equity. In addition, the consolidated income tax provision has
been restated on a combined basis. The impact of the restatement was to decrease
net earnings by $533 thousand in 1998. There were no material transactions
between Central Parking and Allright prior to the Merger.
The Company provides parking consulting services and manages parking
facilities throughout the world, principally in the United States and United
Kingdom. The Company manages and operates owned or leased parking facilities,
manages and operates parking facilities owned or leased by third parties, and
provides financial and other advisory services to clients.
B REVENUES
Parking revenues include the parking revenues from leased and owned
locations. Management contract revenues represent revenues both fixed and
performance based fees from facilities managed for other parties, and
miscellaneous management fees for accounting, insurance and other ancillary
services such as consulting and transportation management services. Parking
revenues, fixed fee management contract revenues and miscellaneous management
fees are recognized when earned. Management contract revenues related to
performance based arrangements are accrued when it is deemed probable that such
amounts will be received.
Management accounts payable reflected on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets is reflected net of cash. Such cash balances belong to the owners
of the various managed facilities, but they are held by the Company and are used
to pay expenses of the managed facilities and ultimately to settle the balance
due to the owners of the managed facilities.
C CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers
cash and cash equivalents to include cash on hand, in banks, and short-term,
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.                    35
36     D INVESTMENTS
Investment securities consist of debt obligations of states and
political subdivisions and are classified into one of three categories, as
follows: i held-to-maturity debt securities, ii trading securities, and
iii securities available-for-sale. Classification of a debt security as
held-to-maturity is based on the Company positive intent and ability to hold
such security to maturity. At September 30, 1999 and 2000, all of the Company
investment securities were classified as held-to-maturity. Such securities are
stated at amortized cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts, unless there is a decline in value which is considered to be other
than temporary, in which case the cost basis of such security is written down to
fair value and the amount of the write-down is reflected in earnings.
E PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT, AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS
Property, equipment, computer software, computer hardware, and
leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided
principally on a straight-line basis over a period of one to fifteen years for
furniture, fixtures, and equipment, over three years for computer software, over
five years for computer hardware, and over thirty to forty years for buildings.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining base lease term or the
estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter.
F INVESTMENT IN PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES
The Company has a number of joint ventures to operate and develop
parking garages through either corporate joint ventures, general partnerships,
limited liability companies, or limited partnerships. The financial results of
the Company joint ventures are generally accounted for under the equity method
and are included in equity in partnership and joint venture earnings in the
accompanying consolidated statements of earnings with the exception of Edison,
which is consolidated into the Company financial statements, with the
remaining 50% eliminated through minority interest.
G INVESTMENT IN EDISON PARKING MANAGEMENT, L.P.
On June 1, 1997, Allright acquired a 50 percent controlling interest in
Edison. Edison assets include management contracts contributed by the limited
partner, Park Fast Parking Management, L.P. Park Fast, a third party. These
management contracts were recorded at their estimated fair market value and are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which
average 12 years.
In conjunction with the Company merger with Allright, Allright
entered into a restructuring agreement whereby Allright loaned an additional
$99 million to the limited partner and amended certain other related
agreements. In addition, the parties agreed that the limited partner capital
account would be increased to $294 million as of the effective date of the
restructuring, which coincided with the consummation date of the merger with
Allright. As a result of this increase in the limited partner capital account,
the Company recorded a $70 million charge to operations concurrent with the
merger. Such charge is reflected in merger costs in the accompanying
consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal 1999.
H CONTRACT AND LEASE RIGHTS
Contract and lease rights consist of capitalized payments made to third
parties which provide the Company the opportunity to manage or lease facilities.
Contract and lease rights are allocated among respective locations and are
amortized principally on a straight-line basis over the terms of related
agreements which range from five to thirty years, or an estimated term
considering anticipated terminations and renewals.
I GOODWILL
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value
of net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
periods to be benefited, ranging from five to thirty years. The Company assesses
the recoverability of this intangible asset by determining whether the
amortization of the goodwill balance over its remaining life can be recovered
through undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation. The
amount of goodwill impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted
future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the Company
average cost of funds. The assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be
impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved.                    36
37     J OTHER ASSETS
Other assets is comprised of a combination of the cash surrender value
of key man life insurance policies, security deposits, key money deposits with
clients, deferred issuance costs related to the sale of Preferred Securities
discussed in Note 10, deferred debt issuance costs related to the Company
credit facilities, and non-compete agreements. Key money represents deposits and
prepayments tendered to clients at the inception of long-term relationships, and
is amortized over the life of the applicable lease. Non-compete agreements are
amortized over the life of the agreement, or the economic useful life whichever
is shorter. Deferred issuance costs related to the Preferred Securities are
amortized over the 30-year life of the underlying subordinated debentures.
Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the related debt.
K LEASE TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED BALANCES
The Company accounts for operating lease obligations and sublease
income on a straight-line basis. Contingent or percentage payments and receipts
are recognized when operations indicate such amounts will be paid or received.
Lease obligations paid in advance are included in prepaid rent. The difference
between actual lease payments and straight-line lease expenses over the lease
term is included in accrued expense or deferred rent, as appropriate. Rent
expense for all operating leases and rental income from subleases are reflected
in cost of parking, or general and administrative expenses.
In connection with its acquisitions, the Company revalued certain
leases to estimated fair market value at the time of the respective acquisition.
Favorable operating leases of entities acquired represent the present value of
the excess of the current market rental over the contractual lease payments.
Unfavorable operating leases of entities acquired represent the present value of
the excess of the contractual lease payments over the current market rental.
Such write-ups and write-downs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
remaining life of the underlying lease, or 30 years, whichever is shorter.
Favorable and unfavorable lease rights are reflected on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets in contract and lease rights and other liabilities,
respectively.
L PROPERTY-RELATED GAINS LOSSES, NET
Property-related gains losses, net reflected on the accompanying
consolidated statements of earnings include i realized gains and losses on the
sale of owned parking facilities assets, ii impairment of long-lived assets,
and iii costs incurred to terminate an existing parking facility lease prior
to its contractual termination date.
M IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. This Statement requires that
long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets
are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by
which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the
fair value less the costs to sell.
The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of long-lived
assets to determine if the net book values of such assets continue to be
recoverable over the remainder of the original estimated useful life. In
performing this review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash
flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
If the sum of the expected net future cash flows undiscounted and without
interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment
loss is recognized based on the estimated diminution of value. If the assets
involved are to be held and used in the operations of the Company, consideration
is also given to actions or remediations the Company might take in order to
achieve the original estimates of cash flows.
N INCOME TAXES
The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company
uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. Work opportunity tax credits are
accounted for by the flow-through method, which recognizes the credits as
reductions of income tax expense in the year utilized. The Company does not
provide for federal income taxes on the accumulated earnings considered
permanently reinvested in foreign subsidiaries.                    37
38     O PRE-OPENING EXPENSES
The direct and incremental costs of hiring and training personnel
associated with the opening of new parking facilities and the associated
internal development costs are expensed as incurred.
P PER SHARE AND SHARE DATA
Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity.
Q FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial position and results of operations of the Company
foreign subsidiaries and equity method joint ventures are measured using local
currency as the functional currency. Translation adjustments arising from the
differences in exchange rates from period to period are generally included in
the currency translation adjustment in shareholders' equity.
R FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company discloses the fair values of on- and off-balance sheet
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value. Fair
value disclosures exclude certain financial instruments such as trade
receivables and payables when carrying values approximate the fair value. Fair
value disclosures are not required for employee benefit obligations, lease
contracts, and all non-financial instruments such as land, buildings and
equipment. The fair values of the financial instruments are estimates based upon
current market conditions and quoted market prices for the same or similar
instruments as of September 30, 2000. Book value approximates fair value for
substantially all of the Company assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet
derivatives that fall under the fair value disclosure requirements.
S STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Company applies the intrinsic value based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board opinion No. 25 APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock options. As such, compensation expense would be
recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying
stock exceeded the exercise price.
T BUSINESS CONCENTRATION
Approximately 41% of the Company total revenues for fiscal year 2000
were attributable to parking and management contract operations geographically
located in the Northeastern area of the United States. See also Note 18.
U RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company utilizes a combination of indemnity and self insurance
coverages up to certain maximum losses for liability, health and workers'
compensation claims. The accompanying consolidated balance sheets reflect the
estimated losses related to such risks. These policies have deductibles which
must be met before the insurance companies are required to reimburse the Company
for costs and liabilities related to covered claims.
V USE OF ESTIMATES
Management of the Company has made certain estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities to prepare these
consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
W RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No.
133 established reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. Under SFAS No. 133,
the Company would recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities,
measured at fair value, in the statement of financial position. In July 1999,
SFAS No. 137 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -
Deferral of Effective Date of FASB No. 133, An Amendment of FASB Statement No.
133 was issued deferring the effective date of SFAS 133 to fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000.                    38
39     The Company must adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138,
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,
an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, on October 1, 2000. On adoption, the
provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 must be applied prospectively. It is
estimated that adoption of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138 will result in the
Company recording a net transition loss of $402 thousand, net of related income
tax of $268 thousand, in accumulated other comprehensive income at October 1,
2000. Further, the adoption of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS 138 will result in the
Company reducing derivative instrument assets by $282 thousand and recording
$387 thousand of derivative instrument liabilities.
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 16, 1998. SOP 98-1 defines which costs incurred to
develop or purchase internal use software should be capitalized and which should
be expensed. The Company adopted this SOP in fiscal 2000. Such adoption did not
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB
101. SAB 101 establishes specific criteria for revenue recognition. The
Company must adopt the provisions of SAB 101 no later than the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2001. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether this SAB will
have a material impact on the Company revenue recognition and presentation
policies.
X RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. Certain reclassifications have been made to
Allright historical financial statements to conform to the Company
presentation.
2 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
ALLRIGHT MERGER
On March 19, 1999, Central Parking completed a merger with Allright,
pursuant to which approximately 70 million shares of Central Parking common
stock and approximately 05 million options and warrants to purchase common
stock of Central Parking, were exchanged for all of the outstanding shares of
common stock and options and warrants to purchase common stock of Allright. The
transaction has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests under APB Opinion
No. 16. Accordingly, Central Parking consolidated financial statements have
been restated to reflect the combined results of operations, financial position
and cash flows of Central Parking and Allright as if Allright had been part of
Central Parking since October 31, 1996, the date of Allright inception.
The Company incurred merger costs of approximately $410 million and
$37 million in fiscal 1999 and 2000, respectively, in connection with the
merger with Allright. These costs, which are directly attributable to the merger
and incremental to the combining companies, are recognized when incurred and are
reflected in the accompanying statement of earnings as merger costs. Included in
these costs are approximately $220 million for professional fees; comprised of
investment banking, legal, accounting, and consulting fees; $124 million
related to employment agreements and severance contracts; $70 million related
to the restructuring agreement with the limited partner of Edison See Note
1g; and the balance of $33 million in travel, supplies, printing, and other
out of pocket costs. In connection with the merger, Allright entered into
certain employment and management continuity agreements with certain employees.
See Note 14.
Following are the results of operations for the separate companies
prior to the merger and the combined amounts presented in the consolidated
financial statements in thousands                           YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

40     PURCHASE ACQUISITIONS
NATIONAL GARAGES, INC.
On December 1, 1997, Allright purchased substantially all of the assets
of National Garages, Inc. National, a privately owned parking company based
in Detroit, which operated facilities located primarily in the Midwestern United
States. The purchase price of approximately $37 million was paid in cash and
financed through working capital and $22 million in debt under Allright
previous revolving line of credit.
KINNEY SYSTEM HOLDING CORP.
On February 12, 1998, Central Parking acquired Kinney System Holding
Corp Kinney, a privately held parking company headquartered in New York
City, for approximately $2088 million, including $1718 million in cash and
$370 million 882,422 shares in Central Parking common stock. In connection
with this transaction, Central Parking assumed $103 million in capital leases,
refinanced $242 million in existing Kinney debt and assumed $46 million of
Kinney debt. Central Parking financed the Kinney acquisition through borrowings
under the Company credit facility, and ultimately from the issuance of Central
Parking common stock and Central Parking obligations pursuant to the Trust
Issued Preferred Securities. Kinney operated parking facilities' in the New York
City metropolitan area, Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations are
included in the Company consolidated financial statements from February 12,
1998. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired of
$1976 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 30 years.
In connection with the Kinney acquisition, the remaining 50% interest
in Spectrum Parking Associates Spectrum was acquired for $36 million. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations are
included in the Company consolidated financial statements from February 13,
1998. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired of
$22 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 18 years.
CENTRAL PARKING SYSTEM OF LOUISIANA, INC.
Central Parking had historically owned 50% of Central Parking System of
Louisiana CPS-Louisiana and on March 30, 1998, purchased the remaining 50%
from Property Service Corporation for $25 million in Central Parking common
stock 52,631 shares. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and,
accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to CPS-Louisiana assets and
liabilities. The excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired
of $25 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 years.
TURNER PARKING SYSTEM, INC.
On April 1, 1998, Central Parking purchased substantially all of the

and limit the amount of dividends paid. On December 28, 1999 the Company entered
into an amendment and waiver to the New Credit Facility agreement relating to

variable rate debt and reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. On
October 27, 1999, the Company entered into a $25 million interest rate swap for
a term of four years, cancelable after two years at the option of the
counterparty, under which the Company will pay to the counterparty a fixed rate
of 616%, and the counterparty will pay to the Company a variable rate equal to
LIBOR. The transaction involved an exchange of fixed rate payments for variable
rate payments and does not involve the exchange of the underlying nominal value.
On March 31, 2000, June 29, 2000, and again on September 29, 2000, the Company

first two cap agreements and 85% for the last cap agreement and each has a term
consistent with the New Credit Facilities. The Company paid a total of $646
thousand for the three $25 million cap agreements. The cost of the instruments
is being amortized over the terms of the agreements.

Company is the sole shareholder purchased the Black Angus Garage, a multi-level
structure with 300 parking stalls, located in New York City, for $196 million.
$133 million of the purchase was financed through a five-year note bearing
interest at one month floating LIBOR plus 1625 basis points. Under terms of the
note payable, the Company monthly principal and interest payments approximate                    46
47 210 thousand. The $127 million principal balance remaining at the end of the
five-year loan term will be due in full. To fix the interest rate, the Company
entered into a five-year LIBOR swap, yielding an effective interest cost of
891% for the five-year period. The parent company has guaranteed $1 million of
the debt, which otherwise would have no recourse except to the LLC. The
remainder of the purchase price was financed from borrowings from the New Credit
Facility.
On May 12, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement effective June
1, 2000, to acquire certain contract and lease rights for approximately $143
million. The transaction was financed by the seller with a two-year obligation
due June 2002 at an interest rate of 732% and is backed by a letter of credit
in the amount of $15 million. Interest is payable monthly.
The Company also has several notes payable outstanding totaling $67
million at September 30, 2000. These notes are secured by real estate and
equipment and bear interest at rates ranging from 61% to 100%.
The Company had previously established a credit facility the Previous
Credit Facility providing for an aggregate availability of up to $300 million,
consisting of a five-year $200 million revolving credit facility, including a
sub-limit of $25 million for standby letters of credit, and a $100 million term
loan. The $100 million term loan was repaid with proceeds from securities
offerings completed in March 1998, and the remaining balance of the revolving
credit facility was repaid with proceeds from the New Credit Facility.
In October 1996, Allright entered into a credit agreement for the
purpose of financing the purchase of Allright Corporation CFSB Term Loan.
Additionally, in October 1996, Allright defeased all of its Industrial
Development Revenue Bonds IRBs in the amount of $179 million and recorded an
extraordinary loss of $10 million, net of tax. At September 30, 2000,
approximately $102 million of the IRB remain outstanding in a trust secured
by U.S. Treasury Bills which were used to defease these instruments. The CFSB
Term Loan was repaid upon consummation of the merger of Allright and the Company
from proceeds of the New Credit Facility, described above. In connection with
the repayment of such amounts, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss of
$10 million, net of tax in fiscal 1999.
Allright had a revolving line of credit Permitted Acquisition Loan
with a maximum borrowing capacity of $75 million, maturing October 30, 1999.
Allright also had a revolving line of credit and letter of credit agreement
revolver with a maximum borrowing capacity of $51 million, maturing October
1, 1999. The revolver and permitted acquisition facilities were terminated in
conjunction with the merger.

In connection with the Kinney acquisition, the Company assumed an
agreement whereby a parking structure and the corresponding land upon which it
sits are leased under a long-term arrangement. The parking structure is
accounted for as a capital lease, and the underlying land is accounted for as an
operating lease. The original agreement called for lease payments over a
twenty-year term at a 174% interest rate. In connection with purchase
accounting, the carrying value of the related obligation was recorded at fair
value. The carrying amount of the capital lease obligation at September 30, 2000
was $62 million, bearing interest at a rate of 80% per annum and requiring
monthly payments of approximately $177,000 per month. The operating lease
requires a payment of approximately $183,000 per month. The lease agreements run
through December 2003.                    47

49     Weighted average common shares used for the computation of basic
earnings per share excludes certain common shares issued pursuant to the
Company restricted stock plan and deferred compensation agreement, because
under the related agreements the holders of restricted stock will forfeit such
shares if certain employment or service requirements are not met. The effect of
the conversion of the company-obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of the
subsidiary trust has not been included in the diluted earnings per share
calculation since such securities were anti-dilutive for all periods. At
September 30, 2000, such securities were convertible into 2,000,000 shares of
common stock. Options to acquire 60,585, 481,573 and 992,352 shares of common
stock were excluded from the 1998, 1999 and 2000 diluted earnings per share
calculations, respectively, because they were antidilutive.
12 OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS

on leased premises under operating leases expiring at various dates through
2101. Lease agreements provide for minimum payments or contingent payments based
upon a percentage of revenue or, in some cases, a combination of both types of
arrangements. Certain locations additionally require the Company and its
subsidiaries to pay real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses.

As of September 30, 2000, the Company has federal net operating loss
carry forwards of approximately $421 million, state and city net operating loss
carry forwards of approximately $561 million, and foreign net operating loss
carry forwards of approximately $05 million which expire between 2002 and 2014.
The ability of the Company to fully utilize these net operating losses is
limited due to changes in ownership of the companies which generated these
losses. These limitations have been considered in determining the deferred tax
asset valuation allowance shown above. Management believes that it is more
likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to
realize deferred tax assets after giving consideration to the valuation
allowance. The valuation allowance has been provided for loss carry forwards for
which recoverability is deemed to be uncertain. The valuation allowance
decreased $21 million in fiscal 2000, of which $558 thousand was credited to
goodwill as that amount related to net operating losses acquired in purchase
acquisitions.
14 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS
A STOCK PLANS
In August 1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved a
stock plan for key personnel, which included a stock option plan and a
restricted stock plan. Under this plan, incentive stock options, as well as
nonqualified options and other stock-based awards, may be granted to officers,
employees and directors. A total of 3,817,500 common shares have been reserved
for issuance under these two plans combined. Options representing 1,521,154
shares are outstanding under the stock option plan at September 30, 2000.
Options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the
date of grant and generally expire ten years after the date of grant. At
September 30, 2000, 281,958 shares had been issued through the restricted stock
plan. Expense related to the vesting of restricted stock is recognized by the
Company over the vesting period.
In August 1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders also approved a
stock plan for directors. This plan provides for the grant, upon each director
initial election, of options to purchase 11,250 shares to each non-employee
director. In addition, each non-employee director who has served for a minimum
of six months on the last day of each fiscal year will receive additional
options to purchase 4,500 shares on that date. A total of 475,000 shares have
been reserved for issuance under the plan. Options to purchase 204,750 shares
are outstanding under this plan at September 30, 2000.
The Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which began April
1, 1996, under which 450,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance. The plan allows participants to contribute up to 10% of their normal
pay as defined in the Plan to a custodial account for purchase of the
Company common stock. Participants may enroll or make changes to their
enrollment annually, and they may withdraw from the plan at any time by giving
the Company written notice. Employees purchase stock annually following the end
of the plan year at a price per share equal to the lesser of 85% of the closing
market price of the common stock on the first or the last trading day of the
plan year. At September 30, 2000, 247,900 shares had been issued under this
plan.                    51

for fiscal 2000, risk free interest based on the treasury bill rate of 10 year
instruments at the date of grant, and an expected life of ten years for all
grants.
B PROFIT-SHARING AND 401K PLAN
The Company has the Profit-Sharing and 401k Savings Plan that allows
eligible participants to make pretax contributions, receive Company 401k match
contributions and to participate in Company profit-sharing contributions. An
employee 18 years or older may become a participant in the Plan after one year
of continuous service, if the employee was employed prior to reaching age 65.
Participants' contributions, Company 401k contributions, and
investment earnings thereon immediately vest. Company profit-sharing
contributions vest after two years of continuous service at a rate of 20% per
year so that the participant is fully vested at the end of seven years.
Employer expense associated with this plan was $28 million, $23
million, and $25 million in years 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.
C INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS
The Company has incentive compensation agreements with certain key
employees. Participating employees receive an annual bonus based on the
profitability of the operations for which they are responsible. Incentive
compensation expense is accrued during the year based upon management estimate
of amounts earned under the related agreements. Incentive compensation under all
such agreements was approximately $58 million, $50 million, and $64 million
in years 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.
D DEFERRED COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS
The Company has a deferred compensation agreement with the President
and Chief Operating Officer of the Company in which the officer is entitled to
receive upon retirement, payments in an aggregate amount equal to 5% of the
increase in the Company cumulative after tax profits since September 30, 1983.
Upon the closing of the Company initial public offering, the Company and the
officer modified the existing agreement by issuing to the officer 267,750 shares
of restricted common stock under the Company restricted stock plan. Further,
the officer may be entitled to receive additional shares of restricted common
stock until his normal retirement or, if earlier, the date of termination of his
employment, in an amount determined by a formula based upon the Company
performance over such period. If the officer voluntarily terminates his
employment with the Company before his normal retirement, or if the Company
terminates his employment for cause, all shares of stock received and to be
received under the restricted stock plan are to be forfeited. The market value
of the restricted stock at the date of issuance was $670,000 greater than the
Company deferred compensation liability. Accordingly, the Company recorded
deferred compensation expense in its shareholders' equity, which is being
amortized ratably over the remaining expected term of the officer employment.
If it is determined that additional shares are to be issued under the agreement,
the Company will recognize compensation expense, spread ratably over the
remaining expected term of the officer employment, equivalent to the market
value of such shares, subject to future market fluctuations prior to the
issuance of such shares.
The Company has a deferred compensation agreement that entitles the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to annual payments of $500 thousand for a
period of ten years following his termination, for any reason other than death,
in exchange for a covenant not to compete. Thereafter, the officer is entitled
to annual payments of $300 thousand until his death and, in the event his wife
survives him, she is entitled to annual payments of $300 thousand until her
death. The Company recognizes annual compensation expense pursuant to this
agreement equivalent to the increase in the actuarially determined future
obligation under the agreement.
Compensation expense associated with these agreements was approximately
$330 thousand, $370 thousand and $255 thousand in fiscal years 1998, 1999 and
2000, respectively.
Agreements with certain former key executives of Allright provide for
aggregate annual payments ranging from $20 thousand to $144 thousand per year
for periods ranging from 10 years to life, beginning when the executive retires
or upon death or disability. Under certain conditions, the amount of deferred
benefits can be reduced. Life insurance contracts with a face value of
approximately $92 million have been purchased to fund, as necessary, the                    53
54 benefits under these agreements. The cash surrender value of the life insurance
contracts is approximately $15 million and $18 million at September 30, 1999
and September 30, 2000, respectively, and is included in other non-current
assets. The plan is a nonqualified plan and is not subject to ERISA funding
requirements. Deferred compensation costs for 1998, 1999 and 2000 were $494
thousand, $557 thousand and $159 thousand, respectively. At September 30, 2000,
the Company had recorded a liability of $67 million for accrued pension costs
associated with this plan. The weighted average discount rate and rate of
increase in future compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligations was 8%.
E DEFERRED UNIT PLAN
On December 19, 1996, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of
the Company Deferred Stock Unit Plan. Under the plan, certain key employees
have the opportunity to defer the receipt of certain portions of their cash
compensation, instead receiving shares of common stock following certain periods
of deferral. The plan is administered by a committee, appointed by the board of
directors of the Company consisting of at least two non-employee outside
directors of the Company.
The Company reserved 375,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1996
Deferred Stock Unit Plan. Participants may defer up to 50% of their salary. As
of September 30, 2000 $14 million of compensation has been deferred under this
plan.
F EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
In connection with the Allright merger, Allright and the Company
entered into various employment agreements with employees of Allright. These
agreements included a retention payments to be made at the closing date of the
merger if the individuals were still employees at such date, b two-year
employment agreements, 50% of each employee benefit thereunder to be paid at
the closing date of the merger and the other 50% to be paid two years after such
date, assuming the individuals were still employed with the Company, and c
continuity benefits which were to be paid six months after the closing date of
the merger, assuming the individuals were still employed at such date. As of
September 30, 2000, payments made under these agreements total $93 million.
Accrued and unpaid amounts related to the second installment of the two-year
employment agreements totaled $929 thousand at September 30, 2000. Expenses
associated with the two-year agreements have been recognized in fiscal 1999 and
2000 in the amounts of $317 thousand and $612 thousand, respectively.
15 RELATED PARTIES
The Company leases two properties from an entity 50% owned by the
Company chairman for $290 thousand per year for a 10-year term and pays
percentage rent to the entity. Total rent expense, including percentage rent,
was $442 thousand, $531 thousand, and $434 thousand in 1998, 1999 and 2000,
respectively. The Company will receive 25% of the gain in the event of a sale of
these properties during the term of the lease pursuant to the lease agreements.
Management believes that such transactions have been on terms no less favorable
to the Company than those that could have been obtained from unaffiliated
persons.
In connection with the acquisition of Kinney, the Company entered into
a consulting agreement with a director of the Company. The Company paid $200
thousand to the director pursuant to this agreement during fiscal 2000.
Additionally, the Company has entered into a limited partnership agreement with
the same director whereby the director has agreed to seek new business
opportunities in the form of leases and management contracts and renewals of
existing leases and contracts as requested by the Company. During the fiscal
years ended September 30, 1999 and 2000, the Company recognized expense of $418
thousand and $220 thousand, respectively, in connection with this agreement.
During fiscal 2000, a former director of the Company exercised a
purchase option on a property owned by the Company. The purchase price was $83
million. The Company recognized a gain of $27 million in connection with the
sale of the property.
16 CONTINGENCIES
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, which
arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate liability with respect to those proceedings and claims will not
materially affect the financial position, operations, or liquidity of the
Company. The Company maintains liability insurance coverage for individual
claims in excess of various dollar amounts, subject to annual aggregate limits.
In connection with the initial formation of Allright and its
acquisition of Allright Corporation predecessor company, Nedinco Delaware
Incorporated Nedinco and Hang Lung Development Company Ltd. agreed to
indemnify Allright for certain costs and liabilities incurred in connection with                    54
55 or arising out of Allright Corporation operations prior to October 31, 1996.
A $219 million letter of credit supports this indemnification.

18 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company business activities consist of domestic and foreign
operations. Foreign operations are conducted in the United Kingdom, Canada,
Spain and Ireland. The Company also conducts business through joint ventures in
Mexico, Germany, Poland and Chile. Revenues attributable to foreign operations
were less than 10% of consolidated revenues for each of fiscal years 1998, 1999
and 2000. In 2000, the United Kingdom and Canada account for 700% and 297% of
total foreign revenues, respectively. Therefore, the Company includes all
foreign operations in a single reporting segment.

The Company is managed based on segments administered by senior vice
presidents. These segments are generally organized geographically, with
exceptions depending on the needs of specific regions. The following is a
summary of revenues, costs, and other expenses by segment for the years ended
September 30, 1999 and 2000 in thousands. It is impractical for the Company to
report such segment information for fiscal 1998 due to the numerous acquisitions
in that period, the Allright merger, and the Company computer conversions in
1999. During fiscal year 2000, the Company realigned certain locations among
segments. All prior years segment data has been reclassified to conform to the
new segment alignment.                    55
