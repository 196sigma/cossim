ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Core Molding Technologies, Inc.
Columbus, Ohio
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Core
Molding Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in
the Index at . These financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Core Molding Technologies, Inc.
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries after elimination of all
material intercompany accounts, transactions and profits. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition - Revenue from product sales is recognized at the time
products are shipped and title transfers. Allowances for returned products and
other credits are estimated and recorded as revenue is recognized. Tooling
revenue is recognized when the customer approves the tool and accepts ownership.
Progress billings and expenses are shown net as an asset or liability on the
Company balance sheet. Tooling in progress can fluctuate significantly from
period to period and is dependent upon the stage of tooling projects and the
related billing and expense payment timetable for individual projects and
therefore does not necessarily reflect projected income or loss from tooling
projects. At December 31, 2005 the Company has recorded a net liability related
to tooling in progress of $1,148,000, which represents approximately $11,164,000
of progress tooling billings and $10,016,000 of progress tooling expenses. At
December 31, 2004 the Company has recorded a net asset related to tooling in
progress of $701,000, which represents approximately $3,001,000 of progress
tooling billings and $3,702,000 of progress tooling expenses.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash is held primarily in one bank.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in,
first-out or market. The Company had recorded an allowance for slow moving and
obsolete inventory of $490,000 at December 31, 2005 and $670,000 at December 31,
2004.                                        29         CORE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Property, Plant and Equipment - Property, plant and equipment are recorded
at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. The carrying amount of long-lived assets is
evaluated annually to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or to
the unamortized balance is warranted.
Ranges of estimated useful lives for computing depreciation are as follows             
Land improvements      20 years
Building and improvements  20-40 years
Machinery and equipment   3-15 years
Tools, dies and patterns  3-5 years   Depreciation expense was $2,158,000, $2,041,000 and $2,153,000 for 2005,
2004, and 2003. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately $0, $0 and $33,000 of
interest costs were capitalized in property, plant and equipment.
Deferred Gain - Deferred gains resulted from sales leaseback transactions
that occurred in 1997 and 1998 and are being amortized over the lease period.
Long-Lived Assets - Long-lived assets consist primarily of property and
equipment, goodwill and a customer list. The recoverability of long-lived assets
is evaluated by an analysis of operating results and consideration of other
significant events or changes in the business environment. The Company evaluates
whether impairment exists for property and equipment and the customer list on
the basis of undiscounted expected future cash flows from operations before
interest. For goodwill, the Company evaluates annually on December 31st whether
impairment exists on the basis of estimated fair value of the associated
reporting unit. If impairment exists, the carrying amount of the long-lived
assets is reduced to its estimated fair value, less any costs associated with
the final settlement. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
there was no impairment of the Company long-lived assets.
Self-Insurance - The Company is self-insured with respect to its Columbus,
Ohio and Gaffney, South Carolina medical and dental claims and Columbus, Ohio
workers' compensation claims. The Company has recorded an estimated liability
for self-insured medical and dental claims incurred but not reported and
worker compensation claims incurred but not reported at December 31, 2005, and
2004 of $1,002,000 and $931,000, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company financial instruments
consist of long-term debt, an interest rate swap, accounts receivable and
accounts payable. The carrying amount of these financial instruments
approximated their fair value.
Concentration of Credit Risk - The Company has significant transactions
with four major customers see Note 3, which together comprised 82%, 82% and
84% of total sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively and 86% and 80% of the
accounts receivable balances at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition. The Company maintains reserves for potential bad debt losses, and
such bad debt losses have been historically within the Company expectations.
Export sales, including sales to Canada and Mexico, for products provided to
certain customers' manufacturing and service locations totaled 15%, 16% and 18%
of total sales for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.                                        30         CORE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Recent Accounting Pronouncements - In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 151, Inventory Costs - an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, which
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and wasted material spoilage and also requires that the
allocation of fixed production overhead be based on the normal capacity of the
production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting this statement but believes it will not have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment.
SFAS 123R is a revision of FASB Statement 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and our related implementation guidance. The statement focuses
primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123R requires a public
entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an
award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
That cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award. We will record non-cash
stock compensation expense of unvested stock options outstanding beginning in
the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R
will depend on share-based payments in the future; we currently expect a
reduction to diluted earnings per share of approximately $003 in 2006.
In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. 123R-3, Transition Election Related
to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. This provides
an elective alternative method that establishes a computational component to
arrive at the beginning balance of the accumulated paid-in capital pool related
to employee compensation and a simplified method to determine the subsequent
impact on the accumulated paid-in capital pool of employee awards that are fully
vested and outstanding upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We are currently
evaluating this transition method.
In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations FIN 47 as a interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143.
This interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement
obligation as used in SFAS 143, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset
retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are
conditional on a future event though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or
method of settlement. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a
liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the
fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. This interpretation
also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably
estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. This interpretation
is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. There is no
material effect to the consolidated financial statements from adoption of FIN
47.
Foreign Currency Adjustments - In conjunction with the Company
acquisition of certain assets of Airshield Corporation, the Company established
operations in Mexico. The functional currency for the Mexican operations is the
United States dollar. All foreign currency asset and liability amounts are
remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Income
statement accounts are translated at the monthly average rates. Gains and losses
resulting from translation of foreign currency financial statements into United
States dollars and gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions

based on certain earnings threshold of the acquired business during the
three-year period beginning January 1, 2005, and continuing through December 31,
2007. Such additional costs will be recorded as an intangible asset. Earning
thresholds were not achieved to require contingent cash payments in 2005.
The acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identified
intangible assets acquired based on fair values at the date of acquisition. If
the acquisition had occurred at January 1, 2004, the operating results of

NOTE PAYABLE - BANK
On December 30, 2003, the Company borrowed $9,000,000 in the form of a note
payable collateralized by the Company assets. The note payable bears interest
at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points or the prime rate and this
rate was 629% at December 31, 2005.
INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BOND
In May 1998, the Company borrowed $7,500,000 through the issuance of an
Industrial Revenue Bond IRB. The IRB bears interest at a weekly adjustable
rate and matures in April 2013. The maximum interest rate that may be charged at
any time over the life of the IRB is 10%.
As security for the IRB, the Company obtained a letter of credit from a
commercial bank, which has a balance of $4,857,000 as of December 31, 2005. The
letter of credit can only be used to pay principal and interest on the IRB. Any
borrowings made under the letter of credit bear interest at the bank prime
rate and are secured by a lien and security interest in all of the Company
assets. The letter of credit expires in April 2010, and the Company intends to
extend the letter of credit each year as required by the IRB.
NOTE PAYABLE - INTERNATIONAL
In 2003, the Company paid $17,859,000 on the original note payable to
International leaving a remaining balance of $200,000. This payment was made on
December 30, 2003 by borrowing $9,000,000 in the form of a note payable from its
primary bank and using cash reserves. The remaining balance of the original
International note of $200,000 was replaced by a new, 8% note due December 31,
2004. At December 31, 2004, this note was recorded as being forgiven due to the
performance objectives being achieved and the amount was recorded in Paid In
Capital because International is a significant shareholder of the Company see
Note 12.
Annual maturities of long-term debt are as follows

LINE OF CREDIT
At December 31, 2005, the Company had available a $7,500,000 variable rate
bank revolving line of credit scheduled to mature on April 30, 2007. The line of
credit bears interest at LIBOR plus two percent or at the prime rate. The line
of credit is collateralized by all the Company assets. There was no
outstanding balance on the bank revolving line of credit at December 31, 2005
and 2004.                                        36         CORE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

INTEREST RATE SWAPS
In conjunction with its variable rate Industrial Revenue Bond, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which is designated as a
cash flow hedging instrument. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed
rate of 489% to the bank and receives 76% of the 30-day commercial paper rate.
The swap term and notional amount matches the payment schedule on the IRB with
final maturity in April 2013. The difference paid or received varies as
short-term interest rates change and is accrued and recognized as an adjustment
to interest expense. While the Company is exposed to credit loss on its interest
rate swap in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to the swap,
management believes such non-performance is unlikely to occur given the
financial resources of the counterparty. The effectiveness of the swap is
assessed at each financial reporting date by comparing the commercial paper rate
of the swap to the benchmark rate underlying the variable rate of the Industrial
Revenue Bond. In all periods presented this cash flow hedge was highly
effective; any ineffectiveness was not material. Interest expense related to the
ineffectiveness of the IRB swap was $7,746 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
None of the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap have been
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
Effective January 1, 2004, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement, which is designated as a cash flow hedge of the bank note payable.
Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of 575% to the bank and
receives LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The swap term and notional amount matches
the payment schedule on the secured note payable with final maturity in January
2011. The interest rate swap is a highly effective hedge because the amount,
benchmark interest rate index, term, and repricing dates of both the interest
rate swap and the hedged variable interest cash flows are exactly the same.
While the Company is exposed to credit loss on its interest rate swap in the
event of non-performance by the counterparty to the swap, management believes
such non-performance is unlikely to occur given the financial resources of the
counterparty. Interest expense includes $162,000 in 2005, $409,000 in 2004 and
$235,000 in 2003 of settlements related to the swaps.
BANK COVENANTS
The Company is subject to formal debt covenants related to minimum fixed
charge coverage and total funded obligations debt ratios. As of December 31,
2005, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

a warehouse facility under operating lease agreements.
In August 2005, in conjunction with the acquisition of the Cincinnati
Fiberglass Division of Diversified Glass, Inc., Core Composites Cincinnati, LLC.

8.  EQUITY
ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES
The Company Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws contain certain
provisions designed to discourage specific types of transactions involving an
actual or threatened change of control of the Company. These provisions, which
are designed to make it more difficult to change majority control of the Board
of Directors without its consent, include provisions related to removal of
Directors, the approval of a merger and certain other transactions as outlined
in the Certificate of Incorporation and any amendments to those provisions.
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER
The Company Certificate of Incorporation contains a provision the
Prohibited Transfer Provision designed to help assure the continued
availability of the Company substantial net operating loss and capital loss
carryforwards see Note 10 by seeking to prevent an ownership change as
defined under current Treasury Department income tax regulations. Under the
Prohibited Transfer Provision, if a stockholder transfers or agrees to transfer
stock, the transfer will be prohibited and void to the extent that it would
cause the transferee to hold a Prohibited Ownership Percentage as defined in
the Company Certificate of Incorporation, but generally, means direct and
indirect ownership of 45% or more of the Company common stock or if the
transfer would result in the transferee ownership increasing if the transferee
had held a Prohibited Ownership Percentage within the three prior years or if
the transferee ownership percentage already exceeds the Prohibited Ownership
Percentage under applicable Federal income tax rules. The Prohibited Transfer
Provision does not prevent transfers of stock between persons who do not hold a
Prohibited Ownership Percentage.
9.  INCENTIVE STOCK PLANS
STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has a Long Term Equity Incentive Plan the Plan, as
originally approved by the shareholders in May 1997, and as amended in May 2000
to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance, that allows for grants
to directors and key employees of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock
options, director options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance shares, performance units and other incentive awards up to an
aggregate of 30 million awards, each representing a right to buy a share of the
Company common stock. Options can be granted under the plan through the
earlier of December 31, 2006, or the date the maximum number of available awards
under the plan have been granted.
During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company granted stock options under the
plan. The options have vesting schedules of five or nine and one-half years from
the date of grant, are not exercisable after ten years from the date of grant,
and were granted at prices which equaled or exceeded the fair market value of
the Company common stock at the date of grant.
On August 4, 2003, of the 1,171,500 stock options outstanding, 978,000
options were tendered for cancellation. The Company issued 594,700 options under
the Plan on February 9, 2004, at $321 per share. On the same date, the Company

On June 30, 2005 the State of Ohio enacted corporate tax legislation which
phases out Ohio Corporate Franchise Tax based on income and phases in a new
gross receipts tax called the Commercial Activity Tax. As a result, Core Molding
Technologies will not be able to realize previously recorded deferred state tax
assets amounting to $214,000. These state deferred tax assets were written off
to expense in 2005.
The American Jobs Creation Act provides a tax deduction calculated as a
percentage of qualified income from manufacturing in the United States. The
percentage increases from 3% to 9% over a six-year period beginning in 2005. The
amount of the deduction available to the Company in 2005 is not significant. In
December 2004, the FASB issued a new staff position providing for this deduction
to be treated as a special deduction, as opposed to a tax rate reduction in
accordance with SFAS No. 109.
Certain tax benefits related to incentive stock options recorded directly to
additional paid in capital totaled $514,000.                                        40         CORE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

At December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $97 million of NOL
carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance
was provided for approximately $4,200,000 of NOL carryforwards, which were
estimated to expire before they could be utilized. In the fourth quarter of
2004, the Company eliminated the valuation allowance because it is more likely
than not that the Company will realize these benefits. The Company anticipates
utilizing all of the NOL carryforwards on its 2005 income tax return.
At December 31, 2005, a provision has not been made for U.S. taxes on
accumulated undistributed earnings of approximately $1,596,000 of the Company

operations and facilities outside of the United States.
11. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company provides postretirement benefits to substantially all of its
United States employees. Costs associated with postretirement benefits include
pension expense, postretirement health care and life insurance expense and
expense related to contributions to two 401k defined contribution plans. In
addition, all of the Company United States union employees are covered under a
multi-employer defined benefit pension plan administered under a collective
bargaining agreement. The Company does not administer this plan and
contributions are determined in accordance with provisions in the negotiated
labor contract.
Prior to the acquisition of Columbus Plastics from International, certain
of the Company employees were participants in various International sponsored
pension and postretirement plans. The International pension plan for
non-represented employees was non-contributory and both benefits and years of
service were frozen as of the date of the acquisition of Columbus Plastics. In
connection with the acquisition, International retained responsibility for the
vested benefits as of December 31, 1996, and the Company agreed to reimburse
International for early retirement subsidies for certain employees. The
accumulated benefit obligation, which equals the projected benefit obligation
and net liability, is $244,000 at December 31, 2005 and 2004.                                        41         CORE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The postretirement health and life insurance plan provides healthcare and
life insurance for certain employees upon their retirement, along with their
spouses and certain dependents and requires cost sharing between the Company,
International and the participants in the form of premiums, co-payments and
deductibles. The Company and International share the cost of benefits for
certain employees, using a formula that allocates the cost based upon the
respective portion of time that the employee was an active service participant
after the acquisition of Columbus Plastics to the period of active service prior
to the acquisition of Columbus Plastics.

In connection with the acquisition of Columbus Plastics, the Company and
International entered into a Supply Agreement. Under the terms of the Supply
Agreement, International agreed to purchase from the Company, and the Company
agreed to sell to International all of International original equipment and
service requirements for Fiberglass Reinforced Parts using the Sheet Molding
Compound process as they then existed or as they may be improved or modified. In
May 2003, the Company entered into a Comprehensive Supply Agreement, which was
effective as of November 1, 2002. Under this Comprehensive Supply Agreement, the
Company became the primary supplier of International original equipment and
service requirements for fiberglass reinforced parts, as long as the Company
remains competitive in cost, quality and delivery, through October 31, 2006. The
Company is in the process of negotiating a new supply agreement to take effect
when the current agreement expires.
International owns 425% of the Company outstanding common stock. Sales
to International were $66,382,000 in 2005, $60,167,000 in 2004 and $51,205,000
in 2003, of which $13,010,000 and $10,705,000 had not been received as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004 and were included in accounts receivable. Receivables
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 also include $3,014,000 and $2,303,000
respectively, for tooling costs owed by International. The Company expensed $0
in 2005 and 2004 and $1,487,000 in 2003, for interest expense on its note
payable to International. During 2003, the Company repaid $19,720,150 of the
International note and the balance of $200,000 was replaced by a note due
December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004 this note was recorded as being forgiven
by International due to the Company meeting certain earning thresholds. The
amount was recorded as Paid In Capital see Note 7.
13. LABOR CONCENTRATION
As of December 31, 2005, the Company employed a total of 1,377 employees,
which consists of 793 employees in its United States operations and 584
employees in its Mexican operations. Of these 1,377 employees, 295 are covered
by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers IAM, which extends to August 6, 2007, and
505 are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Sindicato de
Jorneleros y Obreros, which extends to January 16, 2007.                                        43         CORE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation incidental to the
conduct of its business. However, the Company is presently not involved in any
legal proceedings which in the opinion of management are likely to have a
material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position or
results of operations.
