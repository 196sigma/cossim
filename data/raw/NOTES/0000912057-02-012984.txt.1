REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS   
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. 
In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity deficit and of cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP San Jose, California February 1, 2002 38

CIPHERGEN BIOSYSTEMS,INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The Company  Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. the Company or Ciphergen, which was reincorporated in the State of Delaware on June21, 2000, develops,
manufactures and sells ProteinChip Systems, which consist of consumable ProteinChip Arrays, ProteinChip Readers and ProteinChip Software for life science researchers. These products are sold primarily
to biologists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic and government research laboratories. The Company also provides research services and, with its acquisition of the BioSepra
chromatography business Note4, has entered the protein purification market.  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
Company reports its minority ownership interest in Ciphergen Biosystems, K.K., a joint venture in Japan, using the equity method of accounting. Intercompany profits have been
eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  Certain Risks and Uncertainties  The Company products and services are currently concentrated in a single segment of the life science research field which is characterized by rapid
technological advances and changes in customer requirements. The success of the Company depends on management ability to anticipate or to respond quickly and adequately to technological developments
in its industry, changes in customer requirements or industry standards. Any significant delays in the development or introduction of products or services could have a material adverse effect on the
Company business and operating results. 
The
Company licenses certain technologies that are used in products that represent substantially all of its revenues. An inability to retain such technology licenses could result in a
material adverse effect to the Company. Additionally, some of the components used in its products are from single-source suppliers. If the Company is unable to obtain such components, its financial
condition and operating results could be significantly impacted.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
43  Investments  Management determines the appropriate classification of the Company investments in marketable debt and equity securities at the time of purchase, and
re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies all securities as available-for-sale and carries them at fair value with unrealized gains or losses related to these
securities included as a component of stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company investment objectives include the safety and preservation of invested funds and liquidity of
investments that is sufficient to meet cash flow requirements. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments in debt and equity securities are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and
commercial companies and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximate fair value due to
their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of its debt obligations approximates fair value.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Most of
the Company cash and cash equivalents as of December31, 2001 were deposited with financial institutions in the United States and exceeded federally insured amounts. The Company also
maintains minimal cash deposits with banks in Western Europe and Canada. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. The Company accounts receivable are
derived from sales made to customers located in North America, Europe and Asia. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does not require
collateral. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable. Ciphergen
Biosystems, K.K. accounted for 5% and 11% of revenue in 2001 and 2000, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2001 or 2000.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market value.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Computer
equipment is depreciated over three to four years, laboratory equipment over three to eight years, office furniture and equipment over three to ten years, and demonstration equipment over two years.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lease term. Gains and losses upon asset disposal are reflected in operations in the year of disposition.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired in the Company
acquisitions of IllumeSys Pacific, Inc. in 1997, Ciphergen Technologies, Inc. in 1998, and BioSepra S.A. in 2001. Prior to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets see Recent 
44  Accounting Pronouncements below, goodwill was being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years. Other
intangible assets consist of patents and developed product technology arising from the acquisition of the BioSepra business. These intangibles are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of seven years. 
Goodwill
and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Long-lived Assets  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability is measured by comparison of the asset carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the assets.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue from product sales is recognized upon product shipment, provided no significant obligations remain and collections of the receivables are deemed probable.
Revenue from research contracts is recognized as the work is performed, based on the achievement of milestones described in the contracts. Revenue from up-front payments is deferred and recognized
ratably over the expected life of the contract. Payments for maintenance contracts are usually prepaid, and the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the service contract, which
is generally 12months. For multiple element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each component of the contract using the fair value of the elements. The revenue attributable to any
undelivered elements is deferred and is subsequently recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations to deliver those goods or services.  Research and Development Costs  Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred. Software is an integral component of the Company ProteinChip Systems. Software
development costs incurred in the research and development of new products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established. To date, products and upgrades have generally
reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time.  Stock-based Compensation  The Company accounts for its stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25
APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Under APB 25, unearned compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair
value of the Company stock and the exercise price. Unearned compensation is amortized and expensed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No28. The Company
accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123 and Emerging Issue Task Force No96-18, Accounting for Equity
Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. 
45  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation
allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  Foreign Currency Translation  The functional currencies of the Company foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies. Accordingly, all monetary assets and liabilities of the foreign
operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current period end exchange rates, and non-monetary assets and related elements of expense are translated using historical rates of exchange. Revenues
and other expense elements are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period. The gains and losses from foreign currency translation of these subsidiaries'
financial statements are recorded directly into a separate component of stockholders' equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses have not been significant.  Net Loss per Share  Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders
for the period by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period, if their effect is dilutive. Potential common shares include common stock subject to
repurchase and incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants and upon the conversion of convertible preferred stock.

9,426 Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In July2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statements No141 and 142 FAS141 and FAS142, Business
Combinations and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, respectively. FAS141 eliminates pooling-of-interests accounting prospectively. It also provides guidance on
purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill. FAS142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an
impairment-only approach. Under FAS142, goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. FAS141 and
FAS142 were effective for all business combinations completed after June30, 2001. Upon adoption of FAS142, amortization of goodwill recorded for business combinations
consummated prior to July1, 2001 ceased, and intangible assets acquired prior to July1, 2001 that do not meet the criteria for recognition under FAS141 were reclassified to
goodwill. Companies are required to adopt FAS142 for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2001, but early adoption is permitted in certain circumstances. The Company will adopt
FAS142 on the first day of fiscal 2002 January1, 2002. In connection with the adoption of FAS142, the Company is required to perform a transitional goodwill impairment
assessment. The Company believes that the implementation of these standards will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 
In
August2001, the FASB issued Statement No143 FAS143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
June15, 2002. FAS143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. The Statement applies to all entities. It applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction,
development, and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset except for certain obligations of lessees. Ciphergen does not expect the adoption of FAS143 will have a significant
impact on its results of operations or financial position. 
In
October 2001, the FASB issued Statement No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. FAS144 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of. FAS144 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2001. Ciphergen will adopt the provisions of FAS144 on January1, 2002 and does not expect that such adoption will have a material effect on its financial statements.

securities had scheduled maturities of between one and two years. No marketable debt securities had maturities of less than threemonths at the date of purchase, and none were classified as
cash equivalents. 
During
2001 and 2000, no marketable securities were sold prior to maturity. 
4.Acquisition 
On July31, 2001, the Company acquired BioSepra S.A. BioSepra and certain other assets related to BioSepra chromatography business from Invitrogen
Corporation. Located near Paris, France, BioSepra develops, manufactures and sells chromatography sorbents for large scale purification of proteins. Ciphergen believes that BioSepra protein
chromatography products, combined with Ciphergen ProteinChip Systems, will create a novel approach to protein purification and address a significant bottleneck in the field of proteomics. The
Company paid approximately $120million in cash, net of cash acquired, while incurring direct acquisition costs of approximately $257,000. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of BioSepra and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were included in the Company consolidated financial
statements as of August1, 2001 through December31, 2001. 
The
total purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on independent appraisals and management estimates as follows in
thousands: Tangible net assets acquired Accounts receivable, net, and other current assets 2,028 Inventories, net 2,067 Property and equipment, net 3,859 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 1,427 Capital lease obligations 2,249 4,278 Acquired in-process technology 1,000 Completed technology 5,400 Patents 400 Excess of purchase price over net assets acquired 1,179 Total purchase price 12,257 In
connection with the purchase of BioSepra, the Company recorded a $10million charge to acquired in-process technology. The amount was determined by identifying
research projects for which 
49  technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The value of the projects identified to be in progress was determined by estimating the future cash flows of
the product, then discounting the net cash flows back to their present value at a discount rate consistent with the inherent risk of the particular project. The net cash flows from the identified
in-process projects are expected to commence at various times from 2002 to 2004 and include estimates of research and development costs needed to bring the project from its current state
of development to a point of commercial feasibility. The cash flows are based on expected future revenues, cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative costs, research and development costs
needed to maintain the project throughout its life cycle, and applicable income taxes for the projects. The discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from the weighted-average
cost of capital of BioSepra and adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle of the particular project. Such discount rates ranged between 19% and 25% for all
projects. Development of the technologies remains a substantial risk to the Company due to factors including the remaining effort to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer
markets and competitive threats from other companies. Actual expenses incurred to date have not been materially different from those used in the calculations described above. 
The
amounts allocated to completed technology and patents are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of seven years using the straight-line method. 
The
amount of the purchase price in excess of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and will be periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with FAS142. The
following pro forma summary is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations for future periods or that actually
would have been realized had the Company and Biosepra been a consolidated entity during the periods presented. The summary combines the results of operations as if Biosepra had been acquired as of the
beginning of the periods presented. The summary includes the impact of certain adjustments such as amortization of intangibles. Additionally, the in-process technology charge of
$10million discussed above has been excluded from the periods presented as it arose from the acquisition of Biosepra. Twelve Months Ended December 31 2001

In January1999, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with a Japanese company to forma limited liability corporation, Ciphergen
Biosystems, K.K., to be incorporated under the commercial code of Japan. The Company invested $315,000 in exchange for 30% ownership of the joint venture. The Company has no future funding commitments
to Ciphergen Biosystems, K.K. Commencing after the fiscal year ending December31, 2001, the Company has the option to purchase, based on a predetermined formula price, an aggregate of 40% of
Ciphergen Biosystems, K.K. from its
joint venture partner each year within 30days of the receipt of the joint venture audited financial statements. Such buyout option terminates automatically 30days after the receipt
of the joint venture audited financial statements for the year ending December31, 2004. The Japanese partner is obligated to provide or arrange for working capital for the joint venture
until the Company purchases the additional 40% ownership, at which time the joint venture must repay such financing and arrange its own working capital financing. The Company proportionate share of
the joint venture losses were 
50  recorded in the statement of operations as non-operating losses, until such time as the original investment was written down to zero. Approximately 5% and 11% of the Company revenues in
2001 and 2000, respectively, were from sales to the joint venture. 
In
connection with the joint venture agreement, the Company entered into a distribution and marketing agreement with the joint venture whereby the joint venture would distribute the
Company products in the life science research markets in Japan. In exchange for providing trading, technical support, equipment demonstrations and seminars, the Company received a
non-refundable payment of approximately $315,000. Such payment is included in deferred revenue and is being recognized as other income over a 10-year period, the term of the
joint venture agreement.

7.Commitments and Contingencies  Capital Leases  The Company leases certain machinery and equipment in the U.S. under capital lease agreements, with an independent finance company, which expire through
May1, 2003. The Company also leases its facility in France, under a capital lease with an independent finance company, which expires on February3, 2011. The interest rate on one
capital lease is variable based on the Euribor rate.

As of December31, 2001, future minimum lease payments under capital lease agreements were as follows in thousands: 2002 468 2003 314 2004 232 2005 240 2006 and after 1,411 Total minimum lease payments 2,665 Less: amount representing interest 172 Present value of minimum lease payments 2,493 Less: current portion 410 Non-current portion 2,083 Operating Leases  The Company leases various equipment and facilities in Fremont, California; Malvern, Pennsylvania; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Beijing, China. The facility leases
expire in July2008, September2005, March2003 and November2002, respectively. Under the terms of the facility leases in Fremont and Malvern, the Company is responsible
for common area maintenance. Total rent expense under all
leases, net of sublease income, was $1,791,000, $896,000 and $397,000 for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As
of December31, 2001, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, exclusive of sublease income, were as follows in thousands: 2002 2,990 2003 3,052 2004 3,114 2005 3,193 2006 and after 8,435 20,784 Contingencies  The Company is currently party to three legal proceedings. 
1Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., Ciphergen Technologies, Inc. and IllumeSys Pacific, Inc. v. Molecular Analytical Systems, Inc., LumiCyte, Inc. and T.
William Hutchens. On July12, 2000, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California against Molecular Analytical Systems, Inc. MAS and
LumiCyte, Inc. LumiCyte requesting a declaration of the Company rights, including that Ciphergen has the right to sell information and service products, and requesting a preliminary injunction
preventing MAS from terminating the sublicense agreements. In October 2000, the Company made additional claims against MAS and LumiCyte, and added T. William Hutchens as an individual defendant.
Hutchens is the Chief Executive Officer of both MAS and LumiCyte, as well as a former officer and director of Ciphergen. He is presently the beneficial owner of less than 10% of the Company
outstanding common stock. Ciphergen action seeks, among other things, damages and injunctive relief against defendants for unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of
contract, as well as an injunction precluding defendants from operating in Ciphergen licensed markets. In October 2000, MAS and LumiCyte filed a cross-complaint against Ciphergen, 
52  Ciphergen Technologies, Inc. and IllumeSys Pacific, Inc., the three plaintiffs which filed the underlying lawsuit against MAS and LumiCyte described above. The cross-complaint alleges claims for
breach of contract, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets and declaratory relief regarding the rights of the parties under
the two technology transfer sublicense agreements between MAS and Ciphergen. The cross-complaint also seeks to terminate the sublicense agreements, to obtain injunctive relief, to prevent use of
alleged trade secrets of MAS, and damages. Ciphergen and MAS have entered into an agreement that provides that MAS' license termination notices are suspended pending the conclusion of this lawsuit. In
May 2001, the Company amended its complaint and brought additional claims against MAS, LumiCyte and Hutchens. 
2Molecular Analytical Systems, Inc. v. Ciphergen Biosystems. The proceeding was filed December9, 1999 in the
United States Trademark and Appeal Board. The Company applied for registration of the term SELDI as a trademark. MAS has opposed registration of the trademark and is seeking to have the trademark
registered in its name instead. The Trademark and Appeal Board has suspended the proceeding until resolution of the lawsuit described above. 
3On
July27, 2001, the Company served a demand for arbitration on T.William Hutchens under the July28, 1998 Stock Exchange Agreement among the
Company, Ciphergen Technologies, Inc., Hutchens and others. The demand for arbitration asserts that Hutchens, who was a selling shareholder of Ciphergen Technologies, made representations and
warranties to Ciphergen about the conduct of Ciphergen Technologies' business and its ownership of assets that are contrary to certain claims asserted in the cross-complaint filed by MAS and LumiCyte
and, therefore, that he must pay Ciphergen attorneys fees and indemnify Ciphergen for any losses it might incur resulting from filing of the cross-claims, regardless of their merit. The parties have
agreed to stay the arbitration until the earlier of August1, 2002, or the resolution of any of several of plaintiffs' and cross-complainants' causes of action. 
Although
the ultimate outcome of these matters is not presently determinable, management believes that the resolution of all such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, should the outcome of these matters be unfavorable to the Company, the impact could be material to the
Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
8.Stockholders' Equity 
Stock Split
On
September26, 2000 the board of directors and stockholders approved a 043-for-1 reverse stock split of the common and preferred stock. All share and
per share amounts for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted retroactively. 
Initial Public Offering
The
Company had its initial public offering IPO of 5,500,000 shares of common stock on September28, 2000 at a price of $16 per share. On October3, 2000 the
underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares of common stock. The IPO generated aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $1012million for the Company. The net
proceeds to the Company were approximately $924million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $71million and expenses of the offering of
approximately $17million. Concurrent with the IPO, all of the Company preferred stock and preferred stock warrants automatically converted to common stock and common stock warrants,
respectively. 
53  Preferred Stock
In
February1995, the Company entered into a joint development agreement with Stanford Research Systems which was amended in June2000. It provided for the issuance of a
total of 949,113 shares of SeriesB preferred stock. Through December31, 1999, a total of 712,613 shares of preferred stock were issued under the agreement. During 2000, two additional
milestones were attained and 25,800 shares of preferred stock valued at $379,000 and 12,900 shares of common stock valued at $142,000 were issued, respectively. In 2001, a total of 51,600 common
shares valued at $268,000 were issued upon the attainment of four additional milestones. The remaining 146,200 shares will be issued as common stock upon the achievement of additional milestones. 
In
March2000, the Company issued 4,468,070 shares of SeriesE preferred stock Series E at $6395 per share resulting in net cash proceeds of $269million. The
difference between the conversion price and the fair market value per share of the common stock on the transaction date resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of $267million which has
been reflected as a preferred stock dividend in the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the SeriesE financing, the Company issued the underwriter warrants to purchase 63,053
shares of SeriesE preferred stock for $6395 per share. The warrants had a fair value of $832 per share based on a calculation using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the time of
issuance. The aggregate amount allocated to the warrants based on the relative value of the warrants to the SeriesE preferred stock was $213,000. In March2000, the underwriters
exercised the 63,053 warrants. The resulting difference between the exercise price of the warrants and fair market value of the common stock underlying the SeriesE preferred stock resulted in
an additional beneficial conversion feature of $542,000 on the date these warrants were exercised. This has been reflected as a preferred stock dividend in the consolidated financial statements. At
December31, 2001 and 2000, 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock were authorized, but no shares were issued or outstanding. 
9.Stock Options, Warrants and Employee Stock Purchase Plan  1993 Stock Option Plan  The Company has no shares of common stock reserved for sale to employees, directors or consultants under its 1993 Stock Option Plan the Plan. Under the Plan,
options were granted at prices not lower than 85% and 100% of the fair market value of the common stock for nonstatutory and statutory stock options, respectively. Options are exercisable when granted
and such unvested shares are subject to repurchase upon termination of employment. Should the employment of the holders of common stock subject to repurchase terminate prior to full vesting of the
outstanding shares, the Company may repurchase all unvested shares at a price per share equal to the original exercise price. Options generally vest monthly over a period of five years. At
December31, 2001, a total of approximately 293,000 shares of common stock were subject to repurchase by the Company at a weighted average repurchase price of $218 per share. Unexercised
options generally expire ten years from the date of grant five years for incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of the Company common stock. During 2001, no options were
granted under this Plan. Options for 137,621 shares were cancelled during 2001 and the shares reserved under the Plan were reduced by the same amount.  2000 Stock Plan  In April2000, the stockholders approved the 2000 Stock Plan the New Plan. The Company currently has 2,550,000 shares of common stock reserved for sale
to employees, directors and consultants under this new stock option plan. Under the New Plan, options may be granted at prices not lower than 85% and 100% of the fair market value of the common stock
for nonstatutory and statutory stock options, respectively. Options generally vest monthly over a period of five years. During 
54  2000 there was no activity under this New Plan. During 2001, options for 1,105,100 shares were granted and options for 41,517 shares were cancelled.

based on fair value at the grant date as prescribed by SFAS No123, the Company net loss per share attributable to common stockholders would have increased to the pro forma amounts indicated
below in thousands, except per share data: Years Ended December 31 2001

value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in 2001 and 2000 and the minimum value method in 1999 with the following
weighted assumptions: Years Ended December 31 2001

1999 Risk-free interest rate

5years Expected dividends Volatility
75 75 n/a The
expected average life is based on the assumption that stock options on average are exercised 5years after they are granted. The risk-free interest rate was
calculated in accordance with the grant date and expected average life. During the years ended December31, 2000 and 1999, the exercise prices of all options granted were less than the market
value of the underlying stock on the respective grant dates. During the year ended December31, 2001, the exercise prices of all options granted were equal to fair market value on the dates of
grant. The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $410, $1232 and $026 per share, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation  During the period from April1997 through December31, 2001, the Company recorded $260million of stock-based compensation in accordance
with APB 25, SFAS123 and Emerging Issues Task Force 96-18, related to stock options granted to consultants and employees. For options granted to consultants, the Company determined
the fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected lives of five years; weighted average risk-free rate calculated using
rates between 45% and 62%; expected dividend yield of zero percent; volatility of 75% and deemed values of common stock between $070 and $1467 per share. Stock compensation expense is being
recognized in accordance with FIN 28, an accelerated amortization method, over the vesting periods of the related options, generally five years.

The
allocation of stock-based compensation expense by functional area was as follows in thousands: Years Ended December 31 2001

Warrants exercised after
the Company initial public offering were exercised for common stock. No warrants were issued or exercised in 2001. At December31, 2001, the Company had 9,010 common stock warrants
outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $354 per share.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In April2000, the stockholders approved the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which eligible employees may purchase common stock of the Company
through payroll deductions. Purchases are made semi-annually at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the closing price on the applicable offering commencement date or 85% of the closing
price at the end of the purchase period. The Company currently has 250,999 shares of common stock reserved for issuance to employees under this Plan. There was no activity under this plan in 2000.
During 2001, purchases of 114,001 shares were made under this Plan. 10.Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the current tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amounts expected to be realized. 
The
provision for income taxes was due to current foreign income taxes, which were $143,000 for the year ended December31, 2001. 
Based
on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has
provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December31, 2001.

of December31, 2001, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $481million for federal and $235million for state tax purposes. If not
utilized, these carryforwards will begin to expire beginning in 2009 for federal purposes and 2002 for state purposes. 
The
Company had research credit carryforwards of approximately $14million and $12million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the
federal carryforward will expire in various amounts beginning in 2009. The California credit can be carried forward indefinitely. The
Internal Revenue Code limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event
the Company has had a change in ownership, utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted. 
11.Employee Benefit Plans 
The Company maintains the Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. 401k Savings Plan for its U.S. employees. The Plan allows eligible employees to defer up to 20 subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit, of their pretax compensation in certain investments at the discretion of the employee. Under the Plan, the Company is not required to
make Plan contributions. The Company had not made any contributions to the Plan as of December31, 2001. 
58  12.Related Parties 
At December31, 2001, the Company had two notes receivable totaling $230,000 from an officer, with an imputed interest rate of 60%. The notes are
repayable on or before December30, 2003. Additionally, the Company has various notes receivable from stockholders in the aggregate amount of approximately $13million related to the
early exercise of stock options. These full recourse notes have five year terms, bear interest between 559% and 685% and are collateralized by the underlying stock and other personal assets. All
notes receivable related to the early exercise of options become due immediately upon termination of employment. At December31, 2001, accrued interest on these notes amounted to $154,000. 
During
the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded revenue in the amount of $12million and $11million, respectively, on sales to related
parties. These sales were transactions related to the sale of equipment and consumables to customers who hold minority investments in the Company. Additionally, each year the Company recorded
approximately $31,000 of other income for services performed under the Ciphergen Biosystems, K.K. distribution and marketing agreement. The Company also purchased $372,000 and $352,000 of inventory in
2001 and 2000, respectively, from one of its related parties, and in 2001 and 2000 made non-cash payments in the form of Ciphergen stock to this related party under the terms of a joint
development agreement. See Note8. 13.Segment Information
