CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act as of May27, 2007, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May27, 2007. During the fiscal quarter ended May27, 2007, there was no
change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
