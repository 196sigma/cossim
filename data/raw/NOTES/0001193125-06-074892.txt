NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Description of Business
NeoMagic Corporation designs, develops and markets
high-performance semiconductor solutions, known as Applications Processors, for sale to manufacturers of mobile phones and handheld devices. NeoMagic Corporation was incorporated in California in May 1993. The Company was subsequently reincorporated
in Delaware in February 1997.  The Company incurred significant
net losses and negative cash flows from operations during each of the past several fiscal years and had working capital of $221 million at January31, 2006, up from $185 million at January31, 2005. At January31, 2006, the
Companys principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of $267 million. While a forecast of future events is inherently uncertain, the Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents will satisfy its projected cash
requirements through at least the next twelve months. If the Company experiences a material shortfall versus its plan for fiscal 2007, it expects to take all appropriate actions to ensure the continuing operation of its business and to mitigate any
negative impact on its cash position. The Company believes it can take actions to achieve further reductions in its operating expenses, if necessary. The Company also believes that it can take actions to generate cash by selling or licensing
intellectual property, seeking funding from strategic partners, and seeking further equity or debt financing from financial sources. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Beyond fiscal 2007,
the adequacy of the Companys resources will depend largely on its ability to complete additional financing and its success in re-establishing profitable operations and positive operating cash flows.  Basis of Presentation  For all periods presented, share and per share information in these consolidated financial statements and notes have been
adjusted to reflect the Companys 1 for 5 reverse stock split effective after the close of market on August12, 2005.  The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in January. For ease of presentation, the accompanying financial statements have been shown as
ending on January31 and calendar quarter ends for all annual and quarterly financial statement captions. Fiscal year 2006 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on January29, 2006. Fiscal year 2005 consisted of 53 weeks and ended on
January30, 2005. Fiscal year 2004 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on January25, 2004.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NeoMagic and its wholly owned subsidiaries. NeoMagic is not involved with any variable
interest entities, as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No46R. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Accounts denominated in non-United States currencies have been remeasured
using the United States dollar as the functional currency.  Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates include those relating to determination of
net realizable value of inventories, realizability of deferred tax assets, as well as the assessment of impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Revenue Recognition  The Company derives its revenue from two principal sources: product sales and license fees for patents. 
34 Table of Contents
NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  The Company recognizes revenue from non-distributor product sales when the
products are shipped to the customer, title has transferred, and no obligations remain. In addition, the Company requires the following criteria to be met before recognizing revenue: iexecution of a written customer order, iishipment
of the product, iiifee is fixed or determinable, and ivcollectibility of the proceeds is probable. The Companys shipment terms are FOB shipping point.  With respect to products shipped to distributors, the Company defers recognition of product revenue until the distributors
sell its products to their customers. On occasion, however, the Company may sell products with End of Life status to its distributors under special arrangements without any price protection or return privileges for which the Company
recognizes revenue upon transfer of title, typically upon shipment.  At the end of each accounting period, the Company makes a determination of certain factors including sales returns and allowances, that could affect the amount of revenue recorded for the period. Sales returns provisions include
considerations for known but unprocessed sales returns and estimation for unknown returns based on our historical experiences.  The Company recognizes non-refundable fees for licensing our patents in the period when all of the following conditions are met: ithe Company
enters into a licensing agreement with a licensee that has been executed by both parties, iidelivery has occurred and the Company has no further obligations with respect to the licensing agreement, iiithe fee is fixed and
determinable, and ivcollectibility of the proceeds is probable.  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments  All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less are considered cash equivalents. Investments with an original maturity of greater than 90 days, but less than one year, are classified as short-term
investments.  Investments in marketable equity securities and
debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost with corresponding premiums or discounts amortized
to interest income over the life of the investment. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair market value. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are included,
net of tax, in stockholders equity until their disposition. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income and other. The cost of securities
sold is based on the specific identification method.  All cash
equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair market value. All available-for-sale securities have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet dates. For all classifications of
securities, cost approximates fair market value as of January31, 2006 and 2005, and consists of the following in thousands:  AmortizedCost

determined by the first-in, first-out method. The Company writes down the inventory value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory, based on managements assessment of future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market
conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.  Inventory consists of January31, 2006

Finished goods 159 209 Total 171 376  Long-Lived Assets 
The Company evaluates the carrying value of its long-lived assets,
consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Such events or
circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decline in the Companys market value, significant reductions in projected future cash flows or gross margins, or macroeconomic factors, including a prolonged economic downturn. In
assessing the recoverability of long-lived assets, the Company compares the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount
of the assets, the Company will be required to write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount
rate based upon the Companys weighted average cost of capital. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows, including gross profit
margins, long-term forecasts of the amount and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market, groupings of assets, discount rates and terminal growth rates. In addition, significant estimates and assumptions are required in the
determination of the fair value of the Companys tangible long-lived assets, including replacement cost, economic obsolescence, and 
36 Table of Contents
NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  
the value that could be realized in liquidation. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of the Companys
long-lived assets, thereby requiring the Company to write down the assets.  Property, Plant and Equipment  Property, plant
and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective assets, generally three to five years or, in the
case of property under capital leases, over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or lease term.  Property, plant and equipment consist of the following in thousands:  2006 2005 January31 Property, plant and equipment Computer equipment and software 11,152 11,084 Furniture and fixtures 1,716 1,719 Machinery and equipment 1,515 1,400 Total 14,383 14,203 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 12,015 10,368 Property, plant and equipment, net 2,368 3,835  Other Assets  Other assets at January31, 2006 includes an investment in Neonode Inc.
Neonode of $200,000 and long term lease deposits for our leased facilities. As of January31, 2005, other assets consists of long term lease deposits for our leased facilities. The investment in Neonode represents less than 15%
of Neonodes outstanding common stock. Neonode is a private company that has sold mobile phones that incorporate NeoMagics products.  Warranty  The Company generally sells products with a limited warranty of product quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property
infringement claims related to the Companys products. The Company accrues for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and accrues for estimated but unidentified issues based on
historical activity. The accrual and the related expense for known issues were not significant as of and for the years ended January31, 2006 and 2005. Due to product testing, the short time between product shipment and the detection and
correction of product failures, and a low historical rate of payments on indemnification claims, the accrual based on historical activity and the related expense were not significant for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004.  Concentration of Credit Risk  The Company sells its products to manufacturers of mobile phones and other
handheld devices. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and, generally, does not require collateral. Letters of credit may be required from its customers in certain circumstances. 
37 Table of Contents
NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Net Loss per Share  Net loss per share represents the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period and excludes any dilutive
effects of options, warrants, and convertible securities. The dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible securities are included in diluted earnings per share in profitable periods, but are excluded in loss periods.  Comprehensive Loss  Unrealized gains or losses on the Companys available-for-sale securities are included in comprehensive loss and
reported separately in stockholders equity.  Net
comprehensive loss includes the Companys net loss, as well as accumulated other comprehensive loss on available for sale securities. Net comprehensive loss for the three years ended January31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, is as
follows in thousands:  Years ended January31 2006 2005 2004 Net loss 9,306 28,225 26,775 Net change in unrealized loss on available for sale securities 12 8 15 Net comprehensive loss 9,294 28,233 26,790  Total accumulated
other comprehensive loss was $2,000 and $14,000 at January31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Accumulated other comprehensive loss consists entirely of unrealized losses on available for sale securities.  Research and Development Costs  Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred.
Shipping and Handling Costs  The Companys shipping terms are FOB shipping point and our customers
are responsible for paying all shipping and handling costs directly to the shipping company.  Advertising Costs  The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses were immaterial in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
38 Table of Contents
NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Stock Compensation  At January31, 2006, the Company had several stock-based employee compensation plans, including stock option plans and
an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for description of the plans operated by the Company. The Company accounts for these plans under the intrinsic value method. The following table
illustrates the pro forma effect on net loss and loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition method in accordance with SFAS 123 in thousands, except per share data:  Year Ended January31 2006 2005 2004 Net loss, as reported 9,306 28,225 26,775 Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss, net of related tax effects 500 374 701 Less: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value method for all awards, net of related tax effects 5,131 3,959 3,606 Pro forma net loss 13,937 31,810 29,680 Reported basic and diluted loss per share 132 433 437 Pro forma basic and diluted loss per share 197 488 484  The fair value for
these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  On October28, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of unvested and out-of-the-money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $1000 per share previously awarded to its
employees, including its executive officers and its directors, under the Companys equity compensation plans. Options to purchase 221,240 shares of the Companys common stock became exercisable immediately. The weighted average exercise
price of the options subject to the acceleration was $1406 per share.  The purpose of the acceleration was to enable the Company to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in its consolidated statements of operations, upon adoption of FASB Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123R Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. SFAS123R is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, and will require that compensation expense associated with
stock options be recognized in the statement of operations, rather than as a footnote disclosure in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The pre-tax charge to be avoided amounts to approximately $18 million over the course of the
original vesting periods, which on average is approximately 16 years from the effective date of acceleration. The acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on generally accepted accounting principles. The Company
believes that because the accelerated options had exercise prices in excess of the current market value of the Companys common stock, the options had limited economic value and are not fully achieving their original objective of incentive
compensation and employee retention. 
39 Table of Contents
NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of each option grant was
estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using a dividend yield of 0% and the following additional weighted-average assumptions:  Employee Option Plans Employee StockPurchase Plan Year Ended January31 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Risk-free interest rates

Financial Instruments
The Companys financial instruments consist
principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, employee receivables, capital leases and accounts payable. The Company believes all of the financial instruments recorded values approximate current values
because of the short-term nature of these instruments.  Segment Information
The Company has one operating segment by which management
evaluates performance and allocates resources.  Recent Accounting
Pronouncements  In March 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued EITF Issue No03-1 EITF03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, which provides new guidance for assessing
impairment losses on investments. Additionally, EITF 03-1 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF 03-1; however, the
disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after June15, 2004. The Company will evaluate the impact of EITF 03-1 on its financial statements once the final guidance is issued.  In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs,
an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4. SFAS No151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No151 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No153, Exchanges of
Non-monetary Assetsan amendment of APB Opinion No29, which amends Opinion 29 by eliminating the exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of
non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No153 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005, and implementation is done prospectively. Management does not expect the implementation of this new standard to have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.  In December 2004, the FASB issued and made
effective two Staff Positions FSPs that provide accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effect of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 that was 
40 Table of Contents
NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  
signed into law on October22, 2004. In FSP FAS 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax
Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the FASB concluded that the special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing, created by the new legislation, should be accounted for as a
special deduction instead of a tax rate reduction. As such, the special tax deduction for domestic manufacturing is recognized no earlier than the year in which the deduction is taken on the tax return. FSP FAS 109-2, Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, allows additional time to evaluate the effects of the new legislation on any plan for reinvestment or repatriation of
foreign earnings for purposes of applying FASB Statement No109. The Company does not anticipate that this legislation will impact its results of operations or financial condition.  In February 2006, the FASB decided to move forward with the issuance of a final FSP FAS 123R-4 Classification of Options and
Similar Instruments Issued as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event. The guidance in this FSP FAS 123R-4 amends paragraphs 32 and A229 of FASB Statement No123R to incorporate the
concept articulated in footnote 16 of FAS 123R. That is, a cash settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employees control does not meet the condition in paragraphs 32 and A229
until it becomes probable that the event will occur. Originally under FAS 123R, a provision in a share-based payment plan that required an entity to settle outstanding options in cash upon the occurrence of any contingent event required
classification and accounting for the share based payment as a liability. This caused an issue under certain awards that require or permit, at the holders election, cash settlement of the option or similar instrument upon aa change in
control or other liquidity event of the entity or bdeath or disability of the holder. With this new FSP, these types of cash settlement features will not require liability accounting so long as the feature can be exercised only upon the
occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employees control such as an initial public offering until it becomes probable that event will occur. The guidance in this FSP shall be applied upon initial adoption of Statement 123R.
An entity that adopted Statement 123R before the issuance of the FSP shall apply the guidance in the FSP in the first reporting period beginning after February 2006. Early application of FSP FAS 123R-4 is permitted in periods for which financial
statements have not yet been issued. The Company does not anticipate that this new FSP will have any material impact upon its financial condition or results of operations.  In February 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments. This standard
amends the guidance in FASB Statements No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Statement 155 allows
financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. Management is
currently evaluating the impact FASB 155 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  In September 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF05-02, The Meaning of Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument in EITF Issue No. 00-19,
Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock. EITF 05-02 is effective for new instruments entered into and instruments modified in reporting periods beginning
after June29, 2005. We do not expect there to be a material impact from the adoption of EITF 05-02 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:  Year Ended January31 2006 2005 in thousands Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforward 33,749 31,574 Research and development credit 8,865 4,684 Acquisition costs 53 1,950 Reserves and accruals 553 529 Capitalized research and development 2,906 3,351 Other 1,918 1,295 Total deferred tax assets 48,044 43,383 Valuation allowance 48,044 43,383 Net deferred tax assets  Realization of the
deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. At January31, 2006, the
Company has provided a valuation allowance of $48 million equal to its total deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding their realization. The valuation allowance increased by $46 million, $189 million, and $105 million in fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. At January31, 2006, approximately $34 million of the valuation allowance referenced above relates to the tax benefit of stock option deductions that will be credited to additional paid in capital, when realized.
As of January31, 2006, the Company had net operating
loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $861 million. The federal net operating loss will expire in fiscal years beginning in 2023. The Company also had research and development credit carryforwards for federal income
tax purposes of approximately $41 million, which start to expire in fiscal years beginning in 2019. In addition, the Company had net operating losses and research and development tax credits for state income tax purposes of approximately $63
million and $48 million, respectively. The state net operating loss will start to expire in the years beginning in 2013, and state research and development tax credits will not expire. Utilization of the Companys federal net operating loss
and research credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to the change of ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and research
credit carryforwards before utilization.  Income taxes payable
balances on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are represented by accruals recorded by the Company for income tax liabilities. Income tax liabilities are recorded in accordance with the SFAS 5 criteria of being estimable and probable.  The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Jobs Act, enacted on
October22, 2004, provides for a temporary 85% dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period. The deduction would result in an approximate 525% federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings. To
qualify for the deduction, the earnings must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a companys chief executive officer and approved by its board of directors. Certain other criteria in the
Jobs Act must be satisfied as well. However, as the Company is currently in NOL position, it has opted not to currently reinvest in the United States, as the temporary deduction is provided outside the scope of existing NOLs and would create an
additional tax liability in the United States. The time for obtaining this benefit has expired.

NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  The earnings from foreign operations in India are currently tax exempt
pursuant to a tax holiday effective through 2008. The incentive provides for certain tax relief if certain conditions are met. The Company believes that it continued to be in compliance with these conditions at January31, 2006.  The Company realized a benefit of approximately $31 million in the current
year, which was primarily attributable to a percentage of the potential tax liability, including interest, for NeoMagic Caymans deferred income. As of January31, 2006, the statute of limitations expired and the Cayman entity was
liquidated; therefore, the reserve was released. NeoMagic also increased tax reserves by approximately $335,000 to accrue for potential interest and penalties on outstanding state and foreign reserves.  4. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY  Warrants  The Company granted warrants in connection with the securities purchase agreement entered into with Satellite Strategic
Finance Associates, LLC in August 2004. The warrants were to purchase i200,000 shares of NeoMagic common stock at an exercise price of $800 per share, exercisable until 90 days after the date that the registration statement was filed by the
Company covering the securities and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and ii321,739 shares of common stock at $820 per share, exercisable until August20, 2009. The Securities and Exchange Commission
declared the Companys filing effective September24, 2004 and the warrants for the purchase of 200,000 shares expired on December26, 2004. On December16, 2005, NeoMagic closed the sale and issuance of shares of its Common
Stock and warrants to purchase Common Stock described below that created a dilutive effect to Satellites warrants. An adjustment was made to increase the warrant purchase amount to 335,607 shares of common stock and to decrease the purchase
price to $786 per share. As of January31, 2006, none of the 335,607 warrants had been exercised. See Note 8 Mandatorily Redeemable Series B Preferred Stock, for additional information.  On December16, 2005, NeoMagic closed the sale and issuance to various
investors of i1,500,000 shares of its Common Stock, $001 par value the Shares, and iiwarrants to purchase 749,996 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $900 per share the Warrants. The Company
sold and issued the Shares and the Warrants for an aggregate offering price of $9 million. After deducting offering costs, net cash proceeds received by the Company were $84 million.  The Warrants provide that each holder of a Warrant may exercise its Warrant for shares of Common Stock at an exercise price
of $900 per share. Each Warrant is not exercisable until the date that is six months after the issuance date of such Warrant. The Warrants provide for adjustments to the exercise price and number of shares for which the Warrants may be exercised in
certain circumstances, including stock splits, stock dividends, certain distributions and reclassifications, subject to a minimum price of $779.  Stock Plan  In accordance with the 2003 Stock Plan the Plan, the Board of Directors may grant nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights to
employees, consultants and directors. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees. The Company has a total of 1,003,193 shares reserved under the Plan for future issuance. The Plan terminates in 2013. The Board of Directors determines
vesting provisions for stock purchase rights and options granted under the Plan. Stock options expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. Generally stock options vest over four years when granted to new employees. In the event of
voluntary or involuntary termination of employment with the Company for any reason, with or without cause, all unvested options are forfeited and all vested options must be exercised within a ninety-day period, or as set forth in the option
agreement, or they are forfeited. Certain of the options and stock purchase rights are exercisable

immediately upon grant. However, common shares issued on exercise of options before vesting are subject to repurchase by the Company. As of January31,
2006, no shares of common stock were subject to this repurchase provision. Other options granted under the Plan are exercisable during their term in accordance with the vesting schedules set forth in the option agreement. The 2003 Plan is subject to
an automatic increase for unexercised forfeited shares issued in the 1993 Plan. As of January31, 2006, the maximum number of options outstanding and unexercised in the 1993 Plan was 264,601.  Under the 1998 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan the 1998 Plan, the
Board of Directors may grant nonstatutory stock options to employees, consultants and officers upon their initial employment. The Company has a total of 1,243,874 shares reserved under the 1998 Plan for future issuance. Unless terminated
sooner, the 1998 Plan will terminate automatically in June 2008.  Under the 1993 Stock Plan the 1993 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights to employees, consultants and directors. The Company has a total of
264,601 shares reserved under the 1993 Plan for future issuance. The 1993 Plan terminated in September 2003. The Board of Directors determines vesting provisions for stock purchase rights and options granted under the Plan. Stock options expire no
later than ten years from the date of grant. Generally stock options vest over four years when granted to new employees. In the event of voluntary or involuntary termination of employment with the Company for any reason, with or without cause, all
unvested options are forfeited and all vested options must be exercised within a ninety-day period, or as set forth in the option agreement, or they are forfeited. Certain of the options and stock purchase rights are exercisable immediately upon
grant. However, common shares issued on exercise of options before vesting are subject to repurchase by the Company. As of January31, 2006, no shares of common stock were subject to this repurchase provision. Other options granted under the
1993 Plan are exercisable during their term in accordance with the vesting schedules set forth in the option agreement. Unexercised forfeited shares are transferable to the 2003 Plan as provided within the 2003 Plan.  On October28, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of unvested and
out-of-the-money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $1000 per share previously awarded to its employees, including its executive officers and its directors, under the Companys equity compensation plans.
Options to purchase 221,240 shares of the Companys common stock became exercisable immediately. The weighted average exercise price of the options subject to the acceleration was $1406 per share.  The purpose of the acceleration is to enable the Company to avoid recognizing
compensation expense associated with these options in future periods in its consolidated statements of operations, upon adoption of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R Share-Based Payment SFAS
123R. SFAS 123R is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, and will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of operations, rather than as a footnote
disclosure in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The pre-tax charge to be avoided amounts to approximately $18 million over the course of the original vesting periods, which on average is approximately 16 years from the
effective date of acceleration. The acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on generally accepted accounting principles. The Company believes that because the accelerated options have exercise prices in excess
of the current market value of the Companys common stock, the options have limited economic value and are not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention.  On December22, 2005, the Company entered into an amendment to its 1998
Nonstatutory Stock Plan the 1998 Plan to permit holders of certain stock options to voluntarily make irrevocable advance elections to reduce the exercise period for such stock options. These advance elections could qualify certain
stock options for exemptions from the potentially unfavorable tax effects imposed by Section409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and the proposed regulations issued thereunder collectively, Section 409A.

NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Specifically, the 1998 Plan was amended to authorize and provide the
framework necessary for the implementation of a short-term deferral exercise election; that is, certain eligible stock option holders may elect to exercise stock options that vest in a given calendar year by no later than March15th of the
following year.  If an option holder decides to make this
election, the stock option agreement underlying the eligible stock options subject to the election will be automatically amended to the extent necessary to implement the election.  A summary of the Companys stock option activity under the three plans, and related information for the three years

NEOMAGIC CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Preferred Stock  In fiscal 2000, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to allow the issuance of up
to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan  A total of 979,402 shares of common stock has been reserved for issuance
under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan. The 1997 Purchase Plan is intended to qualify under Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code and has consecutive and overlapping twenty-four month offering periods that
begin every six months. Each twenty-four month offering period includes four six-month purchase periods, during which payroll deductions are accumulated and at the end of which, shares of common stock are purchased with a participants
accumulated payroll deductions. The 1997 Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of the employees compensation. The price of common stock to be purchased under the 1997 Purchase
Plan is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of the offering period or at the end of the relevant purchase period.  In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, 138,214, 147,261, and 115,740 shares, respectively, of common stock at an average price of $220, $480, and $490 per
share, respectively, were issued under the 1997 Purchase Plan. There were 353,735 shares available for future purchase under the Purchase Plan at January31, 2006.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company has elected to follow the intrinsic value method in accounting for its employee stock awards. Under the intrinsic value method, when the
exercise price of the Companys employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation is recognized. 
Had compensation costs been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans, the Companys fiscal 2006 net
loss and loss per share would have increased by approximately $46 million, or $065 per share. The Companys fiscal 2005 net loss and loss per share would have increased by approximately $36 million, or $055 per share. The Companys
fiscal 2004 net loss and loss per share would have increased by approximately $29 million, or $047 per share. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized over the options vesting period and
stock purchased under the 1997 Purchase Plan is amortized over the six-month purchase period.  There were no options granted during fiscal 2006 with an exercise price less than the market price at the date of grant. The weighted average fair value of options granted during fiscal 2005 and fiscal
2004 with exercise prices less than the market price at the date of grant is $380 and $505 per share, respectively. The weighted average fair value of options granted during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 with exercise prices equal to the market price
at the date of grant is $221, $965, and $1270 per share, respectively.  Deferred Stock Compensation  In connection
with the grant of certain stock options to employees in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, the Company recorded deferred stock compensation of $1,493,000 and $572,000, respectively, for the difference between the fair value of common stock at the date of
grant and the option exercise price. These amounts are presented as a credit to additional paid-in capital with an offsetting debit to deferred stock compensation included

in stockholders equity and are amortized over the vesting period of the related options. In connection with the grant of certain stock awards to
employees in fiscal 2004, the Company recorded deferred stock compensation of $621,000 for the difference of the par value of common stock and the fair market value on the Board of Director approval date. The majority shares for the stock awards
were issued to restricted accounts on September18, 2003 and released on March1, 2004 while the residual 10,555 shares were issued on March1, 2004. This amount was presented as a credit to additional paid-in capital with an
offsetting debit to deferred stock compensation included in stockholders equity and was amortized over the vesting period of the related award. In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, $348,000, $434,000, and $31,000, respectively was recorded as
reductions to deferred stock compensation to reflect the unamortized portion of deferred stock compensation related to the cancellation of unvested options upon employee terminations.  5. SAVINGS PLAN  The Company maintains a savings plan under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, employees may contribute up to 60% of their
pre-tax salaries per year, but not more than the statutory limits. Before January1, 2003, the Company contributed $030 for every dollar the employee contributed to the plan up to the first 6% of earnings. The Company stopped the employer
match as of January1, 2003. The Company made no matching contributions to employees in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004.  6. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS  There were no intangible assets outstanding as of January31, 2006 and January31, 2005, respectively.  Amortization expense for other intangible assets was $0, $1,642 and $1,212
thousand in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the company determined that certain licensed intellectual property was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $15 million of which $01 million was charged to cost of sales for licensed intellectual property
that related to products currently in production. The impairment was caused by a decline in the related sales forecasts of products associated with the licensed intellectual property. The impairment charge recorded represents the amount by which the
carrying amount of the licensed intellectual property exceeded its fair value, which was determined based on the Companys estimated discounted future cash flows identifiable to the licensed intellectual property.  7. OBLIGATIONS UNDER CAPITAL LEASES  In fiscal 2003, the Company entered into capital leases for software
licenses used in the design of semiconductors. In March 2004 and October 2004, the Company entered into new capital lease agreements adding additional software and extending the terms of two of the Companys existing leases. Obligations under
capital leases represent the present value of future payments under the lease agreements.

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SERIES B
CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  On August20, 2004, the
Company issued 5,000 shares of Mandatorily Redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred Stock the Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Warrants for the purchase of 321,739 shares of common stock at $820 per share, and Series B Warrants for
the purchase of 200,000 shares of common stock at $800 per share for an aggregate cash purchase price of $5,000,000. After deducting certain transaction costs of $65,000, net cash proceeds received by the Company were $4,935,000. In addition, the
Company incurred out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $392,000 related to the financing. The Series B Preferred Stock was convertible at the option of the investor into 869,565 shares of the Companys Common Stock at a conversion price of
$575 per share, and was subject to certain anti-dilution provisions. The Series B Preferred Stock had a stated maturity on the third anniversary of the closing date. The Series B Preferred Stock was redeemable by the Company for a mandatory payment
of $5 million three years from the issue date of August20, 2004 if the conversion option had not been exercised. The Series B Preferred Stock had liquidation preferences over the Companys Common Stock and had no voting rights.
Furthermore, when the preferred stock remained outstanding, provisions of the Preferred Stock limited our ability to issue any security with seniority to or parity with the Preferred Stock. In addition, there were restrictions on dividend payments
as long as the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock remained outstanding. The Preferred Stockholder converted all of the Preferred Stock into 869,565 shares of the Companys Common Stock in December 2005. The Series A Warrants to
purchase common stock are exercisable for five years from the date of issuance. The Series B Warrants to purchase common stock were exercisable until 90 days after the date that the registration statement relating to the common shares underlying the
securities issued in this transaction was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. On September24, 2004, this registration statement was declared effective and the Series B Warrants expired unexercised on December26,
2004.  In accordance with SFAS 150, the Company classified the
estimated fair value of the Mandatorily Redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as a liability. The Company estimated the fair values of the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series A and B Warrants and allocated the net proceeds of
$4,935,000 based on relative fair values in accordance with EITF 00-27 Application to EITF Issue No98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments EITF 00-27 and calculated the intrinsic value of the conversion option
embedded within the convertible preferred stock using the effective conversion price of $575 per common share. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion option calculated was $1,203,000 and the fair value allocated to the Series A and Series
B warrants was $1,153,000. The fair value allocated to the warrants and the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion option were recorded as credits to additional paid in capital in stockholders equity on the

consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting amount of $2,356,000 treated as a discount and a reduction in the $5 million liability recorded for the
Mandatorily Redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The discount was amortized using the effective interest rate method in accordance with EITF 00-27. The net-recorded liability of $2,644,000 for the Mandatorily Redeemable Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock was accreting to the redemption value of $5 million through charges to interest expense over the three-year period until mandatory redemption. The Preferred Stockholder converted all of the Preferred Stock into 869,565
shares of the Companys Common Stock in December 2005. The Company recognized the remaining unamortized debt discount as interest expense upon conversion in accordance with EITF 00-27. The Company reclassified the remaining $5 million liability
recorded for the Mandatorily Redeemable Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to Common Stock and Paid-in-Capital upon conversion. The Company accreted and recognized interest expense on conversion totaling $20 million in fiscal 2006. The Company
accreted interest expense of $327,000 during fiscal 2005.  The
Companys out-of-pocket expenses of approximately $392,000 related to the financing were recorded as deferred financing costs on the consolidated balance sheets with $131,000 recorded in current assets. The Company recognized the unamortized
deferred financing costs as interest expense upon conversion. The Company recorded amortization of deferred financing costs and recognized interest expense on conversion totaling $337,000 in fiscal 2006. The Company recorded amortization of the
deferred financing costs to interest expense of $54,000 during fiscal 2005.  9. EQUITY FINANCING  On December16,
2005, NeoMagic closed the sale and issuance of i1,500,000 shares of its Common Stock, $001 par value the Shares, and iiwarrants to purchase 749,996 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $900 per share the
Warrants. The Company sold and issued the Shares and the Warrants for an aggregate offering price of $9 million. After deducting offering costs, net cash proceeds received by the Company were $84 million.  The Warrants provide that each holder of a Warrant may exercise its Warrant
for shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $900 per share. Each Warrant is not exercisable until June16, 2006. The Warrants provide for adjustments to the exercise price and number of shares for which the Warrants may be exercised in
certain circumstances, including stock splits, stock dividends, certain distributions, reclassifications and, subject to a minimum price of $779 per share.  The proceeds were allocated between the common stock and the warrants based on their respective fair values. The warrants were classified as equity in
accordance with EITF No. 00-19 Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in a Companys Own Stock EITF 00-19. As both the common stock and warrants are equity instruments the
proceeds from the issuance was allocated on the relative fair value method; however, the Company is aggregating them for financial reporting purposes. This financing transaction is shown on the Statement of Stockholders Equity as Proceeds from
issuance of common stock with detachable warrants.  Investor
agreements associated with the December16, 2005 financing required NeoMagic to register the Shares and Warrants with the SEC. The registration statement for the Shares and Warrants was declared effective on January25, 2006. The investor
agreements also require NeoMagic to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement. If the registration statement does not remain effective, NeoMagic could be required to pay liquidated damages to investors that participated in the
December16, 2005 financing, capped at a maximum of 12% of the subscription amount paid by the investors. The company views the liquidated damages clause as combined with the underlying financial instruments to which the registration rights
relate, consistent with View A expressed in EITF Issue 05-04 The Effect of a Liquidated Damages Clause on a Freestanding Financial

Instrument Subject to EITF 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own
Stock EITF 05-04. The Company assessed that the maximum potential liquidated damages penalty under the registration rights agreement reflects a reasonable discount for the difference between the fair values of the registered and
unregistered shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants. Accordingly, the company concluded that delivery of unregistered shares is not an uneconomic alternative that should be disregarded in determining the classification of the Warrants under
the provisions of EITF 00-19. In accordance with EITF 00-19, Accounting Series Release No268 and EITF Topic D-98, we classified $606,000 in temporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which is an estimate of the maximum potential
liquidated damages that NeoMagic could be required to pay to investors if the registration statement is no longer effective. This registration contingency is expected to decline over time as investors in the December16, 2005 financing sell
their securities.  10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Commitments  In May 1996, the Company moved its principal headquarters to a new facility in Santa Clara, California, under a

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NeoMagic Corporation  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that NeoMagic Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. NeoMagic Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In
our opinion, managements assessment that NeoMagic Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, NeoMagic Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows of NeoMagic Corporation and subsidiaries as of
January31, 2006 and our report dated March10, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ Stonefield Josephson, Inc.  San Francisco, California March10,

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15e and Rule 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January31, 2006. This evaluation was based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. We reviewed the results of managements assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors. In addition, on a quarterly basis we evaluate any changes to our internal control over financial reporting to determine if material changes occurred. 
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Stonefield Josephson Inc., has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein at page 56 and is incorporated by reference into this Item9A.  Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.  Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls  Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
