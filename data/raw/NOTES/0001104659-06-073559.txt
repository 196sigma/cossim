35 Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and Subsidiaries
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and Subsidiaries as of August26,
2006 and August27, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended August26, 2006. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and Subsidiaries at August26,
2006 and August27, 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August26,
2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and Subsidiaries
internal control over financial reporting as of August26, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated November3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R Share-Based
Payment, effective August28, 2005.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollar amounts and shares in thousands, except per share data
1. BUSINESS
MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc.
together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company or MSC is a
distributor of industrial supplies and equipment with headquarters in Melville,
New York. The Company serves primarily domestic markets through its
distribution network of 95 branch offices and seven customer fulfillment
centers located near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Elkhart, Indiana; Atlanta,
Georgia; Reno, Nevada; Elk Grove, Illinois; Livonia, Michigan and Wednesbury,
United Kingdom. The Company acquired JL America,Inc., DBA JL
Industrial Supply JL, a former subsidiary of Kennametal,Inc.,
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. When the JL systems are fully
integrated into MSC which is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal
2007 both of JLs U.S. customer fulfillment centers will be closed, and
their volume will be absorbed into MSCs existing logistics network.
2. SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of
Consolidation
The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MSC and its
subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year
The Companys fiscal year
is on a 52 or 53week basis, ending on a Saturday close to August31.
Fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 each included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2007 will include 53
weeks.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash
Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents
consist of cash in banks, as well as certain highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less.
Concentrations of
Credit Risk
Excluding JL, the Companys mix of receivables is
diverse, with approximately 346,000 combined active customer accounts. The
Company sells its products primarily to end-users. The Company performs
periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and
collateral is generally not required. Receivables are generally due within
30days. The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable
based on numerous factors, including past transaction history with customers
and their credit worthiness and provides a reserve for accounts that are
potentially uncollectible. 41 The Company maintains the
majority of its cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities with
high quality financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed
insurance limits. These deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore bear
minimal risk.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories consist of
merchandise held for resale and are stated at the lower of weighted average
cost or market.
Available-For-Sale
Securities
During fiscal 2006, all available-for-sale securities
were sold, and a loss of approximately $82 was realized. The Companys
investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on
investments are included as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, net of any related tax effect. The Company will
recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of its
investments below the cost basis is judged to be other-than-temporary.
The cost of debt
securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
to maturity. Such amortization is included in interest income. Realized gains
and losses, interest and dividends and declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest
income. The cost of securities sold is based on the first-in, first-out method.
During fiscal 2006, the Company invested in a short-term income fund. All
holdings were sold in fiscal 2006. Realized gains of $858 from the sale of this
investment are included in interest income.
Property, Plant and
Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred; costs of major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
At the time property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the
cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the asset and accumulated
depreciation accounts and the profit or loss on such disposition is reflected
in income.
Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and
equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line
method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The Company capitalizes
certain payroll costs associated with the development of internal computer
systems in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 98-1 Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
These costs are included within property, plant and equipment in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the related computer systems, not to exceed
five years.
Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with business
acquisitions. Accumulated amortization was $7,286 at August26, 2006 and August27,
2005. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by the Company on September2,
2001, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer
amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently, if impairment
indicators arise for impairment. Goodwill increased in fiscal 2006 by $208,450
as a result of the JL acquisition. The Company tests goodwill for
impairment as of the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter using the two-step
process prescribed in SFAS No142. Based on the impairment tests
performed, there was no impairment of goodwill for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and
2004. 42 Other intangible assets with definite lives, which
were acquired pursuant to the JL acquisition, during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006, consist of contract rights, customer relationships and the
website, and net of accumulated amortization were $21,645, $47,678, and $969,
respectively. These assets are being amortized by the straight-line method over
periods ranging from 3 to 10 years weighted average amortization period of 99
years. Other intangible assets also consist of a trademark license agreement
acquired pursuant to the JL acquisition which has an indefinite life and
is not being amortized and has a gross carrying value of $6,000. Accumulated
amortization of the intangible assets at August26, 2006 was $1,828.
Estimated
amortization expense for each of the 5 succeeding fiscal years is as follows

Separable intangible
assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be
amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life. The Company has
evaluated its intangible assets to identify goodwill separately from other
identifiable intangibles. The Company has classified certain of its intangible
assets as goodwill with an indefinite life and no longer amortized. Separate
identifiable intangibles exist, and are amortized, as noted above.
Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets
The Company periodically
evaluates the net realizable value of long-lived assets, including property and
equipment, and deferred catalog costs, relying on a number of factors,
including operating results, business plans, economic projections and
anticipated future cash flows. Impairment is assessed by evaluating the
estimated undiscounted cash flows over the assets remaining life. If estimated
cash flows are insufficient to recover the investment, an impairment loss is
recognized. No impairment loss was required to be recorded by the Company
during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004.
Deferred Catalog
Costs
The costs of producing and distributing the Companys
principal catalogs are deferred $13,618 and $11,894 at August26, 2006
and August27, 2005, respectively and included in other assets in the
Companys consolidated balance sheets in accordance with SOP93-7, Reporting
on Advertising Costs. These costs are charged to expense over the period that the
catalogs remain the most current source of sales, which is typically one year
or less JLs catalog is amortized for two years. The costs associated
with brochures and catalog supplements are charged to expense as distributed.
The total amount of advertising costs, net of co-operative advertising receipts
from vendor sponsored programs, included in operating expenses was
approximately $17,578, $15,521 and $18,199 for the fiscal years ended August26,
2006, August27, 2005 and August28, 2004, respectively.
The Company, in accordance with Emerging Issue Task
Force EITF Issue No02-16, Accounting by a Reseller for Cash
Consideration Received from a Vendor, records cash consideration received for
advertising costs incurred to sell the vendors products as a reduction of the
Companys advertising costs and is included in operating expenses. Rebates
received from a vendor related to volume purchases are recorded as a reduction
to the cost of goods sold. 43 Product Warranties
The Company offers a
maximum one-year warranty, including parts and labor, for certain of its
machinery products. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary
depending upon the product sold. The Company may be able to recoup certain of
these costs through product warranties it holds with its original equipment
manufacturers, which typically range from thirty to ninety days. In general,
many of the Companys general merchandise products are covered by third party
original equipment manufacturers warranties. The Companys warranty expense
has been minimal.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In most cases, these
conditions are met when the product is shipped to the customer or services have
been rendered. The Company reports its sales net of the amount of actual sales
returns and the amount of reserves established for anticipated sales returns
based upon historical return rates.
Shipping and
Handling Costs
In accordance with EITF
Issue 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, the
Company includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers in net sales
and shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight in operating
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The shipping
and handling costs in operating expenses were approximately $60,686, $50,573,
and $45,882 for the fiscal years ended August26, 2006, August27,
2005 and August28, 2004, respectively.
Self-Insurance
The Company has a
self-insured group health plan. The Company is responsible for all covered
claims to a maximum liability of $300 per participant during a September1
plan year. Benefits paid in excess of $300 are reimbursed to the plan under the
Companys stop loss policy. Group health plan expense for fiscal 2006, 2005 and
2004 was approximately $25,774, $23,885, and $18,902, respectively.
Stock Based Compensation
Prior to August28, 2005, the Company accounted
for these plans under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123. As permitted under this standard,
compensation cost was recognized using the intrinsic value method described in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB 25. On August28, 2005, the first day of the Companys
2006 fiscal year, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment FAS 123R and
applied the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin No107 using the modified-prospective transition
method. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2006 includes
compensation expense for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet
vested as of August28, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated
in accordance with the original provisions of FAS123, and compensation
cost for all share-based payments granted on or subsequent to August28,
2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of FAS123R.
APB 25 did not require any compensation expense to be
recorded in the financial statements if the exercise price of the award was not
less than the market price on the date of grant, except in the case of a stock
purchase plan where a discount of up to 15% of the market price was allowed
before any compensation expense was required to be recognized. Since all
options granted by the Company had exercise prices equal to the market price on
the date of grant and the shares purchased through the  44 Associate Stock Purchase
Plan were discounted at 15% of the market price, no compensation expense was
recognized for stock option grants or Associate Stock Purchase Plan grants
prior to August28, 2005.
In accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R, using
the modified-prospective transition method prior periods are not adjusted,
stock-based compensation expense related to stock option plans and the
Associate Stock Purchase Plan included in operating expenses for fiscal 2006
was $7,891. Tax benefits related to this expense for fiscal 2006 was $1,626,
resulting in a reduction in net income of $6,265 $009 per share. The tax
benefit recorded for the stock-based option expense is at a lower rate than the
Companys current effective tax rate because a significant portion of the
options are Incentive Stock Options ISO. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No109 Accounting for Income Taxes, no
tax benefit is recorded for an ISO unless upon exercise a disqualifying
disposition occurs.
Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R all tax benefits
from the exercise of stock options were reported as operating cash flows in the
Companys consolidated statements of cash flows. In accordance with FAS 123R,
the Company will prospectively record excess tax benefits from the exercise of
stock options as cash flows from financing activities. The total tax benefits
for fiscal 2006 was $9,270 of which $8,016 are excess tax benefits and reported
as cash flows from financing activities.
The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions, under which
compensation expense would be recognized as incurred, of SFAS No123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation
for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004.

1 The stock-based
employee compensation expense has been reduced for tax benefits received for
disqualifying dispositions made by stock option plan participants. This
resulted in an increase to pro forma net income of $3,963 and $6,466 in fiscal
2005 and 2004, respectively.
The effects of applying SFAS No123 in this pro
forma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts.
In accordance with APB 25, the Company recorded
compensation expense for restricted stock awards based on the fair market value
on the date of grant. The fair value was recorded as deferred compensation in a
separate component of shareholders equity and expensed over the vesting
period. In accordance with FAS 123R, on August28, 2005, the deferred
compensation balance of $5,534 was reclassified to paid-in-capital.
Stock-based compensation
expense recognized for restricted stock awards was $1,657, $804 and $151 for
the fiscal year ended August26, 2006, August27, 2005 and August28,
2004, respectively. 45 Acquisitions
On June8, 2006, the Company acquired, through
its wholly owned subsidiary, MSC Acquisition Corp. VI, all of the outstanding
common stock of JL, a former subsidiary of Kennametal,Inc. JL
provides metalworking consumables, related products and related technical and
supply chain-related productivity services to small and medium-sized
manufacturers in the United States and the United Kingdom. JL markets
products and services through mail-order catalogs and monthly sales flyers,
telemarketing, the Internet and field sales. JL distributes a broad range
of metalcutting tools, abrasives, drills, machine tool accessories, precision
measuring tools, gages, hand tools and other supplies used in metalcutting
operations. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $349,500
subject to certain post-closing purchase price adjustments of $97million
and certain further purchase price adjustments claimed by Kennametal, Inc.,
which are currently subject to arbitration. In addition, costs and fees of $71million
related to professional fees and other expenses will be included in the
purchase price, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
GAAP. Preliminary post-closing purchase price adjustments that the Company
has agreed to have been reflected below.
The acquisition of JL was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No141 Business
Combinations the Purchase Method and accordingly, the acquired assets and
liabilities were recorded at fair values.
The
total preliminary post-closing purchase price to date has been determined under
purchase accounting under GAAP as follows

and would not significantly affect the ongoing amortization of the intangible
assets associated with the acquisition of JL.
The
acquisition was funded by borrowings under the Companys new unsecured Credit
Facility as defined herein, which was closed simultaneously with the
acquisition, and the remaining amount was funded from available cash reserves
and the liquidation of investments in available-for-sale securities. The

The following unaudited pro forma financial
information is for illustrative purposes only and presents the results of
operations for the years ended August26, 2006 and August27, 2005,
as though the acquisition of JL occurred at the beginning of the
respective periods.
The unaudited pro forma financial information has been
prepared by management for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily
indicative of the condensed consolidated financial position or results of
operations in future periods or the results that actually would have been
realized had MSC and JL been a combined company during the specified
periods. The unaudited pro forma financial information  46 does not reflect any
operating efficiencies and cost savings MSC may achieve with respect to the
combined companies, nor do they include the effects of MSCs repayment of the
borrowings under the Credit Facility, with the exception of the optional loan
repayments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The unaudited pro forma
financial information does not reflect any non-recurring charges, and any
remaining post-closing purchase price adjustments to be resolved by the Company
and Kennametal, Inc. in future periods. These adjustments could have the effect
of the Company paying incremental purchase price, but which amount is not
expected to be material in relation to the size of the overall transaction. The
pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that
the Company believes are reasonable at this point in time. The unaudited pro forma
financial information for the year ended August26, 2006 and
August27, 2005, was prepared by combining the historical statements of
income of the Company and JL.

Credit Facility
On June8, 2006, the
Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, MSC Acquisition Corp. VI, all of
the outstanding common stock of JL, a former subsidiary of Kennametal,Inc.,
for $349,500 subject to certain post-closing purchase price adjustments. The
Company financed $205,000 of the purchase price with a portion of the proceeds
of a new unsecured credit facility the Credit Facility, which was closed
simultaneously with the acquisition. The new Credit Facility includes a
$205,000 term loan, which was drawn in entirety to provide the funding for the
acquisition, and a $75,000 revolver which is available for working capital
purposes. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under the revolving
credit facility. The loan is due for repayment in full on June8, 2011. Principal
payments will begin on June30, 2007, and will be made in quarterly
installments in accordance with the credit agreement. Optional prepayments may
be made at any time, or from time to time, in whole or part, without premium or
penalty. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company repaid $5,000 of
the term loan, reducing the balance to $200,000. The interest rate payable for
all borrowings is currently 50 basis points over LIBOR rates. The borrowing
rate in effect for the Company at August26, 2006 was 585%. Under the
terms of the Credit Facility, the Company is subject to various operating and
financial covenants including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a
minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. At August26, 2006, the
Company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Facility.
Affiliates
The Company is affiliated
with two real estate entities together, the Affiliates. The Affiliates are

Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Companys available-for
sale securities are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices. The
fair value of the Companys debt, including current maturities are estimated
based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on current
rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. The
carrying amounts of the Companys debt at August26, 2006 and
August27, 2005 approximates its fair value. 47 Foreign Currency

Facility, which was closed simultaneously with the acquisition. The new Credit Facility
includes a $205,000 million term loan, which was drawn in entirety to provide

working capital purposes. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under
the revolving credit facility. The loan is due for repayment in full on

will be made in quarterly installments in accordance with the credit agreement.
Optional prepayments may be made at any time, or from time to time, in whole or
part, without premium or penalty. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we
repaid $5,000 of the term loan, reducing the balance to $200,000. The interest
rate payable for all borrowings is currently 50 basis points over LIBOR rates.
The borrowing rate in effect for the Company at August26, 2006 was 585%.
Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we are subject to various operating and
financial covenants including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a
minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio. At August26, 2006, the
Company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Facility.

Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting
The management of MSC
Industrial Direct Company,Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. MSC Industrial Direct
Company,Inc.s internal control system was designed by, or under the
supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to
provide reasonable assurance to MSC Industrial Direct Company,Inc.s
management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that i pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company ii provide
reasonable assurance that the transactions are being recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 57 iii provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements under all
potential conditions. Therefore, effective internal control over financial
reporting provides only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that a
restatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.
MSC Industrial Direct Company,Inc.s management
assessed the effectiveness of MSC Industrial Direct Company,Inc.s
internal control over financial reporting as of August26, 2006, based on
the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework. Based on its assessment under that framework and the
criteria established therein, MSC Industrial Direct Company,Inc.s
management concluded that MSC Industrial Direct Company,Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of August26, 2006.
The Company acquired JL America,Inc., DBA
JL Industrial Supply, a former subsidiary of Kennametal,Inc., on June8,
2006 and has excluded JL Industrial Supply from its assessment of and
conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
For the year ended August26, 2006, JL Industrial Supply accounted
for 52%of the Companys total net revenue. As of August26, 2006,
JL Industrial Supply accounted for 108% of theCompanys total
assets, excluding $2847 million of goodwill and otherintangible asset
amounts that were recorded in connection with the acquisition.
There were no changes in MSC Industrial Direct Companys,Inc.s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period
covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, MSC Industrial Direct Company,Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting.
Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, has audited managements assessment of the
effectiveness of MSC Industrial Direct Company,Inc.s internal control
over financial reporting as of August26, 2006, as stated in their report
which is included herein. 58 REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and Subsidiaries
We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, that MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of August26,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
the COSO criteria. MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and Subsidiaries
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
As indicated in the accompanying Managements Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A, managements
assessmentof and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting did not include the internal controls of JL America,Inc.
which are included in the fiscal2006 consolidated financial statements of
MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and Subsidiaries and constituted 108% of
total assets as of August26, 2006, excluding $2847 million of goodwill
and other intangible asset amounts recorded in connection with the acquisition,
and 52% of revenues for the fiscal year then ended. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting of MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and
Subsidiaries did not include an evaluation of the internal control over
financial reporting of JL America,Inc.
In our opinion, managements assessment that MSC
Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of August26, 2006, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, MSC
Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and  59 Subsidiaries maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of August26, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
MSC Industrial Direct Co.,Inc. and Subsidiaries as of August26,
2006 and August27, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended August26, 2006 and our report dated November3, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion.
