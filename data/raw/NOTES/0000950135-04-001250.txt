Item8,
the Consolidated Financial Statements. We thus believe that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication
of our future performance. Our operating results in some periods
may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and
investors, causing our stock price to decline. We may not be able to fund our
operations. Although we believe that we have sufficient
funding in the near term, we will at some point need to obtain
additional financing. Such financing could come from the
proceeds of public or private debt or equity financings or
corporate partnerships. We may not be able to obtain adequate
funds for our operations from these sources when needed or on
acceptable terms. If we raise additional capital through the
sale of equity, or securities convertible into equity, each
shareholders proportionate ownership in ArQule may be
diluted. If we cannot obtain additional financing, we
could be forced to delay or scale back our research and
development programs. If adequate funds are not available, we
may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain
funds by entering into arrangements with collaboration partners
or others that may require that we relinquish rights to certain
technologies, product candidates, products or potential markets. In particular, our plans for clinical development
of drug candidates will cause us to incur significant costs. If
we are successful in our drug development efforts, we may be
involved in multiple clinical trials with cumulative costs
escalating greatly over time. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investment securities balances as of
December31, 2003 will be sufficient to meet our operating
and capital requirements for the next three years. We have based
this estimate on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be
wrong. Even if we our estimates are correct, we may need or
choose to obtain additional financing during that time. Delaware law and our Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation contain provisions that could
prevent or delay a change of control. Section203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law contains provisions restricting stockholder
action to acquire control of the company. This could discourage
third parties from seeking to obtain control. In addition,
certain aspects of our charter documents, for example, rights to
issue preferred stock without shareholder approval, a board of
directors with staggered terms and limits on the ability of
stockholders to call special meetings or act by written consent
may be considered as hindrances to a change of control. RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY Our patents and other proprietary rights may
fail to protect our business. To be successful and compete, we must obtain and
protect patents on our products and technology and protect our
trade secrets. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for
certain aspects of our technology, but patent protection may not
be available for some of the compounds and drugs, and their use,
synthesis, formulations and technologies we are developing. The
patent position of biotechnology firms is highly uncertain,
involves complex legal and factual questions, and has recently
been the subject of much litigation. No consistent policy has
emerged from the U.S.Patent and Trademark Office or the
courts regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of
protection afforded under many biotechnology patents. In
addition, there is a substantial backlog of biotechnology patent
applications at the U.S.Patent and Trademark Office, and
the approval or rejection of patent applications may take
several years. We do not know whether our patent applications
will result in issued patents. For example, we may not have
developed a method for treating a disease before others have
developed similar methods. In addition, the receipt of a patent
might not provide much practical protection. If we receive a
patent with a narrow scope, then it will be easier for
competitors to design products that do not infringe on our
patent. We cannot be 18 Table of Contents certain that we will receive any additional
patents, that the claims of our patents will offer significant
protection of our technology, or that our patents will not be
challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Competitors may interfere with our patent
protection in a variety of ways. Competitors may claim that they
invented the claimed invention prior to us. Competitors may also
claim that we are infringing on their patents and that therefore
we cannot practice our technology as claimed under our patents.
Competitors may also contest our patents by showing the patent
examiner that the invention was not original, was not novel or
was obvious. In litigation, a competitor could claim that our
issued patents are not valid for a number of reasons. If a court
agrees, we would lose that patent. As a company, we have no
meaningful experience with competitors interfering with our
patents or patent applications. To protect or enforce our patent rights, we may
initiate patent litigation against third parties, such as
infringement lawsuits or interference proceedings. Such
litigation can be expensive, take significant time and divert
managements attention from other business concerns, which
could increase our research and development expense and delay
our product programs. Litigation that we initiate may provoke
third parties to assert claims against us. It is also unclear whether our trade secrets will
prove to be adequately protected. To protect our trade secrets,
we require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute
confidentiality agreements. We cannot guarantee, however, that
these agreements will provide us with adequate protection
against improper use or disclosure of confidential information.
Our employees, consultants or advisors may unintentionally or
willfully disclose our information to competitors. In addition,
in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be
subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees,
consultants or advisors had or have previous employment or
consulting relationships. Like patent litigation, enforcing a
claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our
trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome
is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States
are sometimes less willing than our federal and state courts to
protect trade secrets. Furthermore, others may independently
develop substantially equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. If we must spend significant additional time and
money protecting our patents and trade secrets, we will have
fewer resources to devote to the development of our
technologies, and our business and financial prospects may be
harmed. Our success will depend partly on our ability
to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the
proprietary rights of others. There are many patents in our field of technology
and we cannot guarantee that we do not infringe on those patents
or that we will not infringe on patents granted in the future.
If a patent holder believes a product of ours infringes on its
patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received
patent protection for our technology. Intellectual property
litigation is costly and, even if we prevail, the cost of such
litigation could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, litigation is
time-consuming and could divert management attention and
resources away from our business. If we do not prevail in
litigation, we may have to pay substantial damages for past
infringement. Also, if we lose, the court may prohibit us from
selling or licensing the product that infringes the patent
unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us. The patent
holder is not required to grant us a license. If a license is
available, it may not be available on acceptable terms. For
example, we might have to pay substantial royalties or grant
cross-licenses to its patents. In addition, some licenses may be
nonexclusive and, accordingly, our competitors may have access
to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a
required license, we could encounter delays in product
development while we attempt to design around other patents or
we could even be prohibited from developing, manufacturing or
selling products requiring these licenses. If we are unable to
cost-effectively redesign our products so they do not infringe a
patent, we may be unable to sell some of our products. Any of
these occurrences will result in lost revenues and profits for
us. 19 Table of Contents Our collaborators may restrict our use of
scientific information. We may not be able to acquire any exclusive
rights to technology or products derived from our
collaborations. There is also a risk that disputes may arise as
to the rights to technology or products developed in
collaboration with other parties. The success of our strategy depends, in part, on
our ability to apply a growing base of knowledge, technology and
data across all of our internal projects and our collaborations.
Some of this data has been and will continue to be generated
from our work with collaborators. Although we believe that
certain of this information is not proprietary to our
collaborators, our collaborators may disagree and may succeed in
preventing us from using some or all of this information and/or
technology ourselves or with others. Without the ability to use
this information freely, we may be limited in our ability to
improve the efficiency of our drug discovery and development
process. RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION We may not obtain regulatory approval for the
sale and manufacture of drug products. The development and commercialization of drug
candidates in the United States, including those drug candidates
we develop alone or in collaboration with our partners, are
subject to regulation by U.S.regulatory authorities.
Pharmaceutical products require lengthy and costly testing in
animals and humans and regulatory approval by the appropriate
governmental agencies prior to commercialization. Regulatory
authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if they
believe that the subjects participating in the trials are being
exposed to unacceptable risks or if an agency finds deficiencies
in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our product
under development. Approval of a drug candidate as safe and
effective for use in humans is never certain and these agencies
may delay or deny approval of the products for
commercialization. Changes in regulatory policy during the
period of regulatory review may result in unforeseen delays or
denial of approval. Similar delays and denials may be
encountered in foreign countries. As a company, ArQule has never obtained
regulatory approval to manufacture and sell a drug. If we and/or
our collaborators develop a drug candidate and cannot obtain
this approval, we may not realize milestone or royalty payments
based on commercialization goals for such drug candidate. Even
if regulatory approval is obtained, regulatory authorities may
require additional clinical studies after sales of a drug have
begun. In addition, the identification of certain side effects
after a drug is on the market may result in the subsequent
withdrawal of approval, reformulation of the drug, additional
preclinical and clinical trials, changes in labeling, recalls,
warnings to physicians or the public, and negative publicity. Any of these events could delay or prevent us
from generating revenue from the commercialization of any drug
candidates we develop or help to develop. We have only limited experience in regulatory
affairs, and some of our products may be based on new
technologies; these factors may affect our ability or the time
we require to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. As we have only recently had our first product
candidate in clinical trials, we have only limited experience in
filing and prosecuting the applications necessary to gain
regulatory approvals. Moreover, certain of the products that are
likely to result from our research and development programs may
be based on new technologies and new therapeutic approaches that
have not been extensively tested in humans. The regulatory
requirements governing these types of products may be more
rigorous than for conventional products. As a result, we may
experience a longer regulatory process in connection with any
products that we develop based on these new technologies or new
therapeutic approaches. 20 Table of Contents RISKS RELATING TO PRODUCT
MANUFACTURING If our use of chemical and hazardous materials
violates applicable laws or causes personal injury, we may be
liable for damages. Our drug discovery activities, including the
analysis and synthesis of chemical compounds, involve the
controlled use of chemicals, including flammable, combustible,
toxic and radioactive materials that are potentially hazardous
if misused. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern
our use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials.
These laws and regulations include the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and local
fire and building codes, and regulations promulgated by the
Department of Transportation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the
Department of Energy, the Department of Health and Human
Services, and the laws of Massachusetts, where we conduct our
operations. We may incur significant costs to comply with these
laws and regulations in the future. Notwithstanding our
extensive safety procedures for handling and disposing of such
materials, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from
these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of
an accident, we could be liable for damages, and any such
liability could exceed our resources, disrupt our business and
have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of
operations. Because we have limited manufacturing
capabilities, if we decide to outsource the manufacturing of
chemical compounds, or initiate a drug manufacturing strategy,
we will be dependent on third-party manufacturers or will be
required to incur significant costs and devote significant
efforts to establish our own manufacturing facilities and
capabilities. We have limited experience with the FDAs
good manufacturing practices and no commercial scale
manufacturing capabilities. If we expand beyond our current
manufacturing activities, or apply for regulatory approvals to
commercialize products and services, we will need to develop,
contract for, or otherwise arrange for, the necessary
manufacturing capabilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that
operate under the FDAs good manufacturing practices
regulations capable of manufacturing our products. As a result,
we may experience difficulty finding manufacturers for our
products with adequate capacity for future needs. If we are
unable to arrange for outsourced manufacturing of our products,
or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able
to complete development of our products or market them. Reliance on an outsourced manufacturer entails
risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured
products ourselves, including reliance on the manufacturer for
regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of
breach of the manufacturing agreement because of factors beyond
our control and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of
the agreement by the manufacturer, based on the
manufacturers own business priorities, at a time that is
costly or inconvenient for us. We may in the future elect to manufacture certain
of our products in our own manufacturing facilities. We would
need to invest substantial additional funds and recruit
qualified personnel in order to build or lease and operate any
manufacturing facilities.   
Item2.
Properties In November 1999, we moved our main operations to
a new facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, which includes
approximately 128,000square feet of laboratory and office
space. This facility was designed to our specific requirements.
In March 2001, we purchased this building and the land on which
it sits and a developable adjacent parcel of land for
$182million and $23million, respectively, in an
arms-length transaction with the original developer. We lease approximately 56,000square feet of
laboratory and office space in Medford, Massachusetts, the
majority of which is used for the Pfizer collaboration. We lease
these facilities from Cummings Properties, LLC
Cummings under two lease agreements, one of which
expires on July30, 2005 and the other on July30,
2006. The Company subleases portions of these facilities
pursuant to two sublease agreements. See 21 Table of Contents LEGAL PROCEEDINGS below for a discussion of a
dispute between ArQule and Cummings concerning an increase in
rental rates on the lease that expires on July30, 2006. In March 2002, we entered into an eight year
lease with Pacific Shores Development LLC for approximately
34,000square feet of laboratory and office space in
Redwood City, California. We took occupancy in September 2002.
Each base lease payment, the first of which was due and paid in
September 2002, is $75,823per month, subject to annual
escalation provisions. In December 2002, we announced a major
restructuring of our operations which included closing our
facilities in Redwood City, California as of December31,
2002 and Cambridge, United Kingdom as of March31, 2003. In
October 2003, ArQule completed an agreement with InPharmatica
Ltd. to sell certain assets of its former operations in the
United Kingdom and to assign its facility lease obligation. We
are actively attempting to sub-lease our California facilities.
See Note11, Restructuring Actions in notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item8 in
this Annual Report on Form10-K.   
Item3.
Legal Proceedings On August1, 2001, Cummings significantly
raised ArQules rent on the lease that expires
July30, 2006. We believe this increase to be in excess of
that which is permissible under the lease agreement.
Accordingly, on January16, 2002, we brought a complaint in
the Superior Court of Middlesex County in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts for declaratory relief and damages against
Cummings arising, in part, out of Cummings attempts to
increase the lease rates. Nevertheless, during the pendency of
this dispute, we are paying the rental rates proposed by
Cummings. The Company seeks recovery of the funds that it has
already paid, and is paying, under protest. If we are
unsuccessful in our claim against Cummings, and must pay all or
a portion of the rental expense increase currently proposed by
Cummings, we may be required to record an additional expense of
up to approximately $08million to record the difference
between our contractual rental payments and contractual sublease
rental income over the remaining period of the lease.
Conversely, if the contingency is resolved in ArQules
favor and the Company is entitled to a refund of amounts
previously paid, the Company may be required to record a gain in
a future period. ArQule has been named as one of multiple
co-defendants, including Wyeth,Inc. and Solvay
Pharmaceuticals,Inc., in seven related lawsuits, filed by
a number of individual plaintiffs beginning in July 2003 in
U.S.District Courts in the Southern and Eastern Districts
in Texas and in the District Court, 281stJudicial
District, Harris County, Texas. Plaintiffs in these proceedings
are seeking damages relating to alleged personal injuries
claimed to be the result of taking Hormone Replacement Therapy.
The Company was never involved in the manufacture, marketing or
sale of Hormone Replacement Therapy drugs and does not believe
that it has produced or provided any compounds that have been
introduced to humans relating to the products that are the
subject of these claims. ArQule has filed or is filing
stipulations of dismissal or a motion to dismiss in each of
these cases. Although we cannot predict the outcome of any
litigation, as of the date of this annual report, based on the
information now available to us, we do not believe that these
lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably
likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the Company, its business, prospects,
financial condition or operating results. 22 Table of Contents

In January 2001, ArQule acquired Camitro
Corporation for $843million in a stock purchase
transaction. In conjunction with the transaction, we recorded
intangible assets for core technology and goodwill of
$236million and $297million, respectively, each of
which was being amortized over their estimated useful lives of
seven years. We also immediately charged to income the estimated
fair value of purchased in-process technology that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative
use.
b
Effective January1, 2002, we adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and accordingly ceased
recording periodic goodwill amortization charges in lieu of
performance of annual assessments for impairment.
c
In the fourth quarter of 2002, we performed
impairment assessments of the carrying value of the
Companys core technology and goodwill balances. These
assessments indicated that the value of the assets were fully
impaired and, accordingly, we took impairment charges for the
full remaining carrying value.
d
In December 2002, ArQule announced a major
restructuring of its operations whereby it eliminated 31% of its
workforce and closed its operations in Redwood City, California
and Cambridge, United Kingdom.
e
In September 2003, ArQule acquired Cyclis
Pharmaceuticals,Inc. for $259million in a stock
purchase transaction. In connection with the transaction, we
immediately charged to income $304million representing
purchased in-process research and development that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative
use.
f
In October 2003, ArQule completed an agreement
with InPharmatica Ltd. to sell certain assets of its former
operations in the United Kingdom and to assign its facility
obligation. As a result ArQule reversed $03million of
restructuring accrual to reflect a change in its original
estimate of the remaining leasehold obligations and assumed
sublease income in the United Kingdom. In December 2003, the
adequacy of the restructuring accrual and assumed sublease
income relative to the lease commitment in Redwood City,
California was reassessed and, based on deteriorating market
conditions, an additional provision of $15million was
recorded.
g
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the carrying value
of an investment in a privately-held proteomic company was
written down by $48million to reflect the estimated fair
value of the investment.
Item7.
Managements Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview We are a biotechnology company engaged in the
research and development of small molecule cancer therapeutics.
We also provide fee-based chemistry services to pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies to produce novel chemical compounds
with drug-like characteristics. We have incurred a cumulative net loss of
$184million from inception through December31, 2003.
Our expenses prior to September 2003 related to development
activities associated with our chemistry services, the
associated administrative costs required to support those
efforts, and the cost of acquisitions. We expect research and
development costs to increase in 2004 as we pursue development
of our cancer programs. We do not expect to make additional
investments in chemistry services during 2004. Although we have
generated positive cash flow from operations for the last five
years, we have recorded a net loss for each of those years. We
expect to record a loss for 2004. Based on our cash position at
the end of 2003 we will be able to dedicate approximately
$25million per year over the next three years to our
ACTSM research and development 25 Table of Contents program. This estimate is based upon the
assumption that we will continue to operate our chemistry
services on a cash flow positive basis, and to invest in cancer
related research and development. Our revenue is derived from chemistry services
performed for our customers. Revenue, expenses and gross margin
fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon contractual
deliverables and the timing of the recognition of revenue under
our revenue recognition policy see the discussion of this under
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below.
As we increase our activities in cancer related research and
development, the timing and extent of these efforts, together
with the length and outcome of our clinical trials will further
impact the fluctuation of results from operations. While our
focus will be on cancer related research and development, we
will continue to pursue revenue opportunities from customers for
our chemistry services. In February 2004, we initiated a restructuring
involving a reduction in workforce of 55 people, or 19% of the
total workforce. This was undertaken to better align our
resources with our new focus on cancer related research and
development, and in response to a decrease in chemistry services
activities. We plan to aggressively hire expertise in the field
of drug discovery during 2004, and anticipate no net headcount
decrease by the end of the year. Liquidity and Capital Resources

$108million in 2003, compared to $17million in
2002. The increase in 2003 was due to $70million for the
Cyclis acquisition and $45million for capital additions,
which was partially offset by net proceeds from the sale and
maturity of marketable securities of $07million. The
composition and mix of cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities may change frequently as a result of the
Companys constant evaluation of conditions in financial
markets and the timing of specific investments. Cash and cash equivalents used in financing
activities. The total was
$14million in 2003, compared to $37million in
2002. The 2003 use was comprised of $74million of
principal repayments on our term loan to Fleet National Bank and
$25million of long-term debt assumed in connection with
the acquisition of Cyclis and subsequently repaid. This was
partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock
of $85million, of which $80million represents an
investment by Pfizer. We have been cash flow positive from operations
for five consecutive years. We expect that our available cash
and marketable securities of $77million at
December31, 2003, together with operating revenues and
investment income, will be sufficient to finance our working
capital and capital requirements for the next three years. In
addition, we are currently considering raising additional
capital through a follow-on public offering of our securities.
We have filed a shelf registration statement on FormS-3
with the SEC covering securities having an aggregate maximum
amount of $50million. 26 Table of Contents Our cash requirements may vary materially from
those now planned depending upon the results of our drug
discovery and development strategies, our ability to enter into
any additional corporate collaborations in the future and the
terms of such collaborations, results of research and
development, the need for currently unanticipated capital
expenditures, competitive and technological advances,
acquisitions and other factors. We cannot guarantee that we will
be able to obtain additional customers for our chemistry
services, or that such services will produce revenues adequate
to fund our operating expenses. We cannot guarantee that we will
be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial
product. If we experience increased losses, we may have to seek
additional financing from public and private sale of our
securities, including equity securities. There can be no
assurance that additional funding will be available when needed
or on acceptable terms. Our contractual obligations were comprised of the

Included in the total minimum payments for
operating leases is approximately $67million related to
unoccupied real estate in California which was accrued as a
liability, net of assumed sublease income, as a part of the
Companys restructuring charges in 2002 see Note11
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item8 of this
Form10K. Purchase obligations are comprised primarily of
outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses and payments
to license certain intellectual property to support the
Companys research efforts. Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates A critical accounting policy is one
which is both important to the portrayal of the Companys
financial condition and results and requires managements
most difficult, subjective or complex judgements, often as a
result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters
that are inherently uncertain. Management believes the following
are critical accounting policies. Please see the discussion of
our significant accounting policies in Note2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8 of
this Form10-K for additional information.   
Revenue Recognition ArQule has entered into various chemistry-based
collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies. Revenue from these collaborative agreements is
recognized as follows   
Non-refundable technology transfer
fees. Under certain circumstances
these are recognized as revenue upon completion of performance
of a specified deliverable. However, where the effort is
relatively constant over the performance period of the contract,
the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
performance period of the contract.
Funding of compound development
work. Revenue is recognized over the
term of the applicable contract using the proportional
achievement of deliveries against a compound delivery schedule,
or the development labor expended against a total research and
development labor plan, as the measure of progress toward
completion.
Payments based upon delivery of
compounds. Payments based upon
delivery of specialized compounds meeting the
collaborators specified criteria are recognized as revenue
once our obligations are complete, the collaborator has accepted
the delivery of these compounds and collection is reasonably
assured.
27 Table of Contents   
Certain milestones and royalties on product
sales. If there are no continuing
performance obligations, these revenues are recognized upon
achievement of the related milestone. Revenues from milestone
payments related to continuing performance obligations are
recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if
all of a specified list of conditions are met. Otherwise, the
milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over
the term of the performance obligations.
We follow these guidelines to measure revenue;
however, certain judgments affect the application of these
policies. For example, in connection with our Pfizer
collaboration we have recorded current and long term deferred
revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be
recognized. The estimate of deferred revenue reflects our
estimate of the timing and extent of services that we will
provide to Pfizer. Our services to Pfizer, and the timing of
those services, are difficult to estimate and are impacted by
factors outside of our control. For example, the timing and
quantity of compounds we provide is largely dependent on
Pfizers internal needs. Changes to estimates could impact
the timing and amount of revenue we recognize in the future.   
Purchase Accounting and In-process Research
and Development Upon consummation of the Cyclis acquisition, we
immediately charged to income $304million representing
purchased in-process research and development
IPRD that had not yet reached technical
feasibility and had no alternative future use. Approximately
$14million of the charge represents the fair value of the
IPRD; the remaining $164million of the charge
represents the allocation to IPRD of a portion of the
excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired. We believe that this charge represents a
reasonably reliable estimate of the future benefits attributed
to purchased IPRD. The value assigned IPRD before the
step-up adjustment was composed of the projected value of three
Cyclis preclinical drug development projects based on various
mechanisms of actions associated with the ACTSM
technology. The valuation was determined using the income
approach. Potential revenue and drug development expenses were
projected through 2020 based on information obtained from
management and from published third-party industry statistics
for similar drug development businesses. Specifically, we
estimated that the development of our current cancer programs
through clinical trials to commercial viability will take
approximately nine years and cost in excess of
$500million. The discounted cash flow method was applied
to the projected cash flows, adjusted for the probability of
success, using a discount rate of 30%. The discount rate takes
into consideration the uncertainty surrounding successful
development and commercialization of the IPRD. Since the
acquisition, nothing has occurred that would lead us to believe
that the original estimates of the cost to develop these
compounds, or their revenue potential, is materially different
from the estimates used at the time of the acquisition for
purposes of purchase accounting.   
Restructuring Charges Accruals for abandoned facilities under lease
require significant management judgment and the use of
estimates, including assumptions concerning our ability to
sublease certain operating leases for abandoned real estate see
Note11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item8 of this 10-K. These estimates of the time required
to sublease the facilities and sublease rates the Company will
receive were based on our analysis of the local real estate
markets and general economic conditions in the regions of the
abandoned facilities. If it takes longer to sublease these
facilities than the Company has estimated, or if the sublease
rates are less favorable than estimated, the Company may be
required to take an additional charge for abandoned real estate
of up to $31million. Conversely, if the space is
subleased either earlier than estimated or if the sublease rates
actually achieved are more favorable, the Company may be
required to reverse a portion of its current accrual for
abandoned real estate.   
Investments in Non-marketable Equity
Securities At December31, 2003, we performed an
assessment of the fair value of our investment in a privately
held proteomics company. This assessment included analysis of
that companys current financial condition, its 28 Table of Contents prospects for generating additional cash flow
from operating activities, the current market conditions for
raising capital funding for companies in this industry and the
likelihood that any funding raised would significantly dilute
our ownership percentage. As a result of this analysis it was
our judgment that an impairment had occurred and that the fair
value of our investment was $03million, resulting in a
non-cash loss on investment of $47million. If this entity
is unsuccessful in its efforts to secure additional financing it
may cease operations, rendering our investment worthless and
necessitating a further write down. If the value of this
investment recovers, we will not write-up the investment until
it is sold.   
Lease Commitments We lease approximately 56,000square feet of
laboratory and office space in Medford, Massachusetts, the
majority of which is used for the Pfizer collaboration. We lease
these facilities from Cummings Properties, LLC
Cummings under two lease agreements, one of which
expires on July30, 2005 and one of which expires on
July30, 2006. The Company subleases portions of these
facilities pursuant to two sublease agreements. On August1, 2001, Cummings significantly
raised ArQules rent, as outlined in Item3, LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS. We made an estimate of the most likely outcome of
this contingency and concluded that no provision is required at
December31, 2003. It is our estimation that the most
likely settlement at trial would result in no net financial
statement loss. Nevertheless, if we are unsuccessful at trial,
the Company could be required to record an additional expense of
up to $8million. Results of Operations Years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003

2003 as compared to
2002: Revenue increased by
$27million, or 4%. Revenue from our chemistry
collaboration with Pfizer increased by $85million due to
an increase in the number of compounds developed under the terms
of the contract and our receipt of certain contractual milestone
payments on an accelerated basis because we met delivery
requirements in 2003 ahead of schedule. This increase was offset
by reductions in revenue from Bayer of $21million, Solvay
of $11million, and Pharmacia of $05million as the
Company completed its final contractual obligations with these
companies in 2003, and from reductions in revenue from Searle of
$10million, Wyeth of $07million and
Glaxo-Smith-Kline of $06million whose contracts all ended
in 2002. We expect revenue from our chemical services contracts
to decrease in 2004 as a result of February 2004 amendments to
our Pfizer agreement that will cause our compound deliveries to
Pfizer to remain stable at 2004 levels, instead of increasing as
previously agreed. In addition, in 2003 we completed the Bayer,
Solvay and Pharmacia agreements. 2002 as compared to
2001: Revenue increased by
$44million, or 8%, primarily due to a $105million
increase in Custom Array library revenues from our agreement
with Pfizer. This increase was partially offset by reductions in
revenue from Wyeth of $31million, from Johnson
Johnson of $17million, and from Sankyo of
$13million as these collaborations wound down.

29 Table of Contents 2003 as compared to
2002: Cost of revenue increased due to
increased cost of personnel, materials and facility related
expenses, including depreciation, necessary to satisfy the
increase in activity under the Pfizer contract during 2003,
partially offset by a reduction in material costs associated
with the completion of the Bayer contract during the third
quarter of 2003. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue
increased primarily as a result of the one-time increase in
Pfizer revenue due to our receipt of certain contractual
milestone payments on an accelerated basis because we met
delivery requirements in 2003 ahead of schedule and to the
recognition of previously deferred revenue from Bayer as a
result of our completing our contractual obligations. the
associated costs for which were incurred in earlier years. We
expect cost of revenue will decrease in 2004 as a result of
lower revenues and the resultant decrease in direct production
and material costs due to the absence of activity under the
Bayer, Solvay and Pharmacia agreements, which were terminated in
2003. We expect gross margin percentage to decrease in 2004 as a
result of the lower revenues available to offset fixed overhead
and facility-related expenses. 2002 as compared to
2001: Cost of revenue increased due to
increased cost of personnel and materials necessary to satisfy
the 2002 expansion of the Pfizer collaboration. Our gross margin
as a percentage of revenue decreased by 57 percentage points
due to the increased labor and material costs necessary to
fulfill the Pfizer and Bayer collaborations.

2003 as compared to
2002: The $125million decrease
in research and development primarily reflects the cost savings
associated with the Companys decision in December 2002 to
cease further development of the Camitro predictive modeling
technology, to close the related facilities in Redwood City,
California effective December31, 2002 and Cambridge,
United Kingdom effective March31, 2003, and to realign
its workforce in order to expedite its transition to a drug
discovery and development company. These cost savings were
partially offset by the increased cost associated with the
acquisition of Cyclis in September 2003, notably the addition of
approximately 14 scientists, increased laboratory supply and
facility expenses and the cost of preclinical and clinical
studies to develop the ACTSM platform and ARQ 501. We
expect research and development expense to increase in 2004 as
we expand our oncology discovery pipeline and begin clinical
trials. 2002 as compared to
2001: The $29million increase
primarily consists of an additional $21million in
personnel and related costs and $09million of additional
third-party information system technology as the result of our
efforts to augment and enhance our chemistry, biology,
predictive and computational modeling capabilities and related
proprietary technologies. In 2002, the Company devoted
additional personnel and resources to the integration and
refinement of the respective technologies in order to advance
the objective of a fully integrated drug discovery platform.

Redwood City and Cambridge facilities. The decrease consists
primarily of reductions in employee related expenses of
$18million, professional fees of $06million and
facility related expense of $06million. We expect
marketing 30 Table of Contents general and administrative expense to decrease in
2004 as a result of our restructuring actions in the first

2003. Acquisition
related charges in 2003 relate to the September8, 2003
acquisition of Cyclis. Upon consummation of the Cyclis
acquisition, we immediately charged to income $304million
representing purchased in-process research and development
IPRD that had not yet reached technical
feasibility and had no alternative future use. Approximately
$14million of the charge represents the fair value of the
IPRD. The remaining $164million of the charge
represents a step-up adjustment resulting from the excess of the
purchase price over the identifiable tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed which was allocated on a
pro rata basis to the carrying value of acquired long-lived
assets. See Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates above for a discussion of our accounting
policies and significant estimates. 2002 and 2001.
Acquisition related charges in 2002 and 2001 all relate to the
January 2001 acquisition of Camitro. Upon consummation of the
acquisition in January 2001, we immediately charged to income
$180million representing the estimated fair value of
purchased in-process technology that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see
Note4 of notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item8 of this 10-K. In 2002, we continued to recognize stock-based
compensation charges based on the amortization of deferred
compensation arising from the issuance of stock options issued
below market value and restricted stock to former employees of
Camitro, in addition to amortizing core technology. We
implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS142 in January 2002, and accordingly
ceased recording periodic goodwill amortization charges in lieu
of performing annual assessments for impairment. At
December31, 2002, we assessed the recoverability of the
carrying value of our core technology and goodwill balances and,
based on the applicable accounting standards, recorded
impairment charges of $171million and $259million,
respectively, representing the entire remaining balances of
these assets. See Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates above for a discussion of our accounting
policies and significant estimates.   
Restructuring Related Charges In December 2002, we announced a restructuring of
our operations whereby we ceased further development and
commercialization of the Camitro predictive modeling technology
and realigned our workforce to expedite the transition towards
becoming a drug discovery company. The restructuring actions included closing our
facilities in Redwood City, California and Cambridge, United
Kingdom, along with the termination of employees in these
facilities and our Massachusetts facilities. 31 Table of Contents The Company recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $127million, the components of which are as

facilities in Redwood City, California and Cambridge and the
non-cash write-off of leasehold improvements and equipment no
longer expected to provide future economic benefit at the
abandoned facilities, less assumed proceeds from sale. Other
charges include a $05million non-cash stock compensation
charge, contractual obligations which provided no future value
to the Company, and other miscellaneous costs associated with
closing the California and United Kingdom operations. See
