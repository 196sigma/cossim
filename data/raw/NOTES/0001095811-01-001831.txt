REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Cepheid
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cepheid as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cepheid at
December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 2000
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Business
Cepheid the Company was incorporated in the State of California on
March 4, 1996. We develop new technology platforms that exploit the advantages
of micromachining, microelectronics, and microfluidic technologies to create
automated, integrated, miniaturized instrument systems for life sciences
research, clinical diagnostics, industrial testing and pharmacogenomics markets.
Through March 31, 2000, we were considered to be in the development stage.
During May 2000, we launched our first product, the Smart CyclerR, through a
distributor in the United States and recognized revenue from product sales.
Consequently, we are no longer considered to be in the development stage.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Cepheid include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped,
when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably
assured. No rights of return exist for product sales.
Contract revenues related to best efforts, research and development
agreements and government grants are recognized as the related services are
performed. Revenue is earned based on the performance requirements of the
contract. Non-refundable contract fees for which no further performance
obligations exist, and there is no continuing involvement by the Company, are
recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection
is assured. Under these agreements, the Company is required to perform specific
research and development activities and is reimbursed based on the costs
associated with each specific contract over the term of the agreement. Milestone
related revenues are recognized upon the achievement of the specified milestone.
Deferred revenue is recorded when funds are received in advance of services to
be performed.
Significant Concentrations
We distribute our products through our direct sales force and third-party
distributors. Product revenue from our two distributors, each representing 10%
or more of total revenue, was 52% for Fisher Scientific Company L.L.C. and 17%
for Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2000, and zero in the
previous year.
The Company relies on several companies as the sole source of various
materials in its manufacturing process. Any extended interruption in the supply
of these materials could result in the failure to meet customer demand.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to
concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash equivalents and
marketable securities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000
Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable accounts payable and
short-term debt approximated fair value as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments.
Warranty Accrual
We generally warrant our products from defect for a period of 12 months
from the date of sale for material and labor costs to repair the product.
Accordingly, a provision for the estimated cost of the warranty is recorded at
the time revenue is recognized. As of December 31, 2000, the accrued warranty
liability was approximately $319,000.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for
company-sponsored and collaborative research and development activities. These
costs include direct and research-related overhead expenses. Research and
development expenses under collaborative agreements and government grants
approximate the revenue recognized under such agreements. The Company expenses
research and development costs as such costs are incurred.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks, money
market instruments, commercial paper and debt securities with original
maturities of 90 days or less. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had
$39,698,000 and $1,493,000, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents.
We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale and record our
investments at fair market value in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at amounts that
approximate fair market value based on quoted market prices with unrealized
gains and losses recorded as a separate component of the shareholders' equity.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates
actual cost or market, with cost determined on the first-in-first-out FIFO
method.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method, and the cost is amortized over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Software Costs
In March 1998, the ACIPA issued Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP
98-1. SOP 98-1 requires that the entities capitalize certain costs related to
internal use software once certain criteria have been met. The Company adopted
the provisions of SOP 98-1 on January 1, 1999. From inception through December
31, 2000, the
41
44
CEPHEID
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000
Company has capitalized approximately $525,000 relating to the purchase and
installation of enterprise resource planning, accounting, cadcam and
documentation systems for internal use. The assets are depreciated using the
straight-line method over a useful life which is expected to be five years.
Impairment Of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of SFAS 121, the Company reviews
long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever
events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts
of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Under SFAS 121, an impairment loss
would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its
carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is assessed using discounted cash flows.
Through December 31, 2000, there have been no such losses.
Stock-Based Compensation
As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, the Company has elected
to account for stock options granted to employees and directors using the
intrinsic value method and; accordingly, does not recognize compensation expense
for stock options granted to employees with exercise prices equal to the fair
value of the underlying common shares. Options granted to non-employees have
been accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force
Consensus No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other
Than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services,
and may be periodically re-measured with the resulting value charged to expense
over the period of the related services being rendered see Note 11.
Comprehensive Income Loss
Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other comprehensive loss.
Cepheid other comprehensive loss consists of unrealized loss on
available-for-sale securities. Total comprehensive loss and the components of
accumulated other comprehensive loss are presented in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Total accumulated other
comprehensive income is displayed as a separate component of stockholders'
equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Segment Reporting
Effective in January 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information SFAS 131. SFAS 131 establishes annual and interim
reporting standards for an enterprise operating segments and related
disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas, and major customers.
The Company has determined that it operates in only one segment and accordingly,
the adoption of SFAS 131 had no impact on the financial statements.
Net Loss Per Common Share
Basic net loss per common share has been calculated based on the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, less
shares subject to the Company right of repurchase. Diluted net loss per share
would give effect to the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents consisting
of stock options and warrants calculated using the treasury stock method.
Potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of
diluted net loss per share as their inclusion would be antidilutive. The
computation of pro

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998 and June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
Activities and SFAS No. 137 Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments
and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
133. These statements require companies to record derivatives on the balance
sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses
resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for
depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge
accounting. SFAS 133 will be effective for Cepheid fiscal year ending December
31, 2001. Management believes that the adoption of these statements will not
have a significant impact on the Company financial position or results
43

CEPHEID
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000
of operations as the Company holds no derivative financial instruments and does
not currently engage in hedging activities.
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation -- an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 FIN 44, which,
among other issues, addresses repricing and other modifications made to
previously issued stock options. We adopted FIN 44 in July 2000. The original
terms of certain stock options granted to employees were modified at a date
subsequent to the date of grant. Such modification resulted in new measurement
dates for accounting purposes. Accordingly, approximately $770,000 was recorded
as stock-based compensation, and such amounts have been included in the research
and development expenses in the accompanying 2000 consolidated financial
statements.
In December 1999, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. This bulletin
summarizes certain of the SEC views in applying accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. to revenue recognition in financial statements.
The Company adopted SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of 2000, effective as of
January 1, 2000. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a significant effect on
our operating results or financial position.
2. LICENSE AGREEMENTS

In November 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Army
to conduct research and development services relating to the design and
development of a specified device. The agreement was modified in May and August
of 1998 and modified again in May and December of 2000. The agreement provides
for research and development cost-plus-fixed-fee funding and is performed on a
best-efforts basis. The aggregate funding for the agreement, including all
modifications, totaled $1,899,545. The contract termination date has been
extended to August 2001 and includes additional funding. Revenue recognized
under this research agreement was $220,943 10% of total grant and
government-sponsored research revenue, $976,071 43% of total grant and
government sponsored research revenue and $262,412 9% of total grant and
government sponsored research revenue for the years ended December 31, 2000,

Grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
In May 1998, the Company received a three-year grant of approximately
$5,000,000 from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA to
perform research and development on the design and development of a specific
device. Over the three year period, approximately $1,000,000 of this amount
directly funds work being performed by the United States Military Institute for
Infectious Disease USAMRIID, a subcontractor to the Company under the grant.
The associated revenue and expense related to these subcontractors appear in the
Company statement of operations. The three-year grant is subject to annual
funding approval. For the first, second and third years of the program 1,057,254, $1,643,013 and $1,429,084, respectively, have been awarded. Such
amounts exclude funding for the USAMRIID subcontract. Costs associated with the
research and development activities under this grant for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, approximate the revenue recognized of $984,233
44% of total grant and government-sponsored research revenue, $968,348 43% of
total grant and government sponsored research revenue, and $882,213 31% of
total grant and government sponsored research revenue, respectively.
4. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENT
In November 1998, the Company entered into a joint research and development
collaboration and supply agreement with Innogenetics NV, which provides funding
for best efforts research and development activities to be performed by the
Company. The contract does not have a specified term, however, termination may
occur upon mutual consent of the parties or by contract breach. Funding under
this arrangement approximates $14 million, and revenue recognized under this
research arrangement was $416,137, $730,817 and $476,125 for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

9. EQUIPMENT FINANCING
In July 1997, the Company entered into an initial equipment financing
agreement with a financing company for up to $1,000,000. In March 1999, the
equipment line was increased to $2,530,000 which the Company could draw upon
through December 31, 1999. In October 2000, the Company entered into a new
equipment financing agreement with the same financing company for an additional
$2,000,000 upon which the Company could draw through October 31, 2001. As of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had financed and $3,251,605 and
$2,073,467, respectively, in equipment purchases under these agreements. The
equipment loans are to be repaid over 42 to 48 months at interest rates ranging
from 995% to 1290% and are secured by the related equipment.
In November 1999, $306,000 of the financed amount was deposited with the
financing company in accordance with a negative covenant pledge agreement which
stipulated that such a payment is required if the Company failed to meet certain
on-hand cash requirements during the life of the agreement. The deposit was
refunded to the Company in March 2000 upon meeting those requirements. As of
December 31, 1999, this deposit was included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets.
In conjunction with the original agreement, the Company issued the
financing company a warrant to purchase 32,000 shares of the Company Series A
Preferred Stock at $175 per share see Note 11. The warrant is exercisable
immediately. In conjunction with a March 1999 amendment to the agreement, the
Company issued the financing company a warrant to purchase 13,600 shares of the
Company common stock at an exercise price of $235 per share. The warrant is
exercisable immediately. The value of all warrants issued to the financing
company, determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model, was immaterial for
accounting purposes; therefore, no value was recorded related to these warrants.

initial term of the lease. Lease payments under this operating lease are subject
to future increases based on the Consumer Price Index. In connection with the
facility lease agreement, the Company obtained an irrevocable standby letter of
credit in the amount of $300,000 to secure its building lease. This requirement
was terminated in March 1999. The term of the second lease is two years,
expiring on April 30, 2002, with a 27% rent increase scheduled to begin on May

11. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Change in Authorized Shares
In January 2000, the Company Board of Directors approved an amendment to
the Company articles of incorporation, which increased the number of
authorized shares of common stock to 30,000,000 shares. Also in January 2000,
the Board of Directors increased the authorized number of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock to 7,130,000 shares. In March 2000, the Board of Directors
approved an amendment to the Company articles of incorporation. In that
amendment, the Company was authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of its common
and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
Initial Public Offering
On June 21, 2000, the Company completed its initial public offering of
5,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $600 per share. The offering
resulted in net proceeds of approximately $268 million. At the close of the
offering, all issued and outstanding shares of the Company preferred stock
were converted into
48

CEPHEID
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 2000
13,326,636 shares of common stock. In July 2000, the underwriters of the initial
public offering exercised their over-allotment option and purchased an
additional 750,000 shares of the Company common stock, generating additional
net proceeds of approximately $42 million.
Convertible Preferred Stock
Immediately prior to the completion of the Company initial public
offering, all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock converted into
an aggregate of 13,326,636 shares of common stock. The following table describes
information with respect to the series of convertible preferred stock prior to
the initial public offering                              SHARES ISSUED   ISSUANCE PRICE

Series A, B and C convertible preferred shareholders were entitled to
noncumulative annual dividends, when and if declared by the board of directors,
of $08, $14 and $18 per share, respectively, payable in preference to common
stock dividends. No dividends had been declared or paid by the Company. Each
share of convertible preferred stock voted equally with shares of common stock
on an if-converted basis.
Founders and Directors' Shares
From August 1996 to August 1997, the Company issued 5,876,000 shares of
common stock to founders and directors of the Company. Generally, these common
shares are subject to the Company lapsing right of repurchase. This right
lapses ratably over a period of 48 months from the date of purchase. There were
412,000 and 1,568,040 shares subject to repurchase by the Company as of December
31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Deemed Dividend
In January through March 2000, the Company consummated the sale of
6,379,978 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock from which the Company
received proceeds of approximately $191 million or $300 per share. At the date
of issuance, the Company believed the per share price of $300 represented the
fair value of the preferred stock. Subsequent to the commencement of the
Company initial public offering process, Cepheid re-evaluated the fair value
of its common stock as of January and March 2000. Accordingly, the increase in
fair value has resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of $191 million that
has been recorded as a deemed dividend to preferred shareholders in 2000. The
Company recorded the deemed dividend at the date of issuance by offsetting
charges and credits to additional paid-in-capital, without any effect on total
shareholders' equity. This charge was made against additional paid in capital,
as the Company did not have retained earnings from which it could have deducted
a deemed dividend. The preferred stock dividend increases the net loss allocable
to common shareholders in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per
common share for the year ended December 31, 2000. The guidelines set forth in
the Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No. 98-5 limit the amount of the deemed
dividend to the amount of the proceeds of the related financing.

Warrants
In connection with the equipment financing agreement entered into in
October 1997 and amended in March 1999, the Company issued warrants to purchase
32,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of
$175 per share and 13,600 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $235
per share. These warrants were exercised during 2000 and are included in common
stock issued as of December 31, 2000. The value of the warrants was
insignificant for accounting purposes.
In connection with the Series B Preferred Stock offering in 1998, the
Company issued warrants to purchase 274,797 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $258 per share to the private placement agent for the Series
B Preferred Stock financing. The warrants expire on April 30, 2003. The warrants
are exercisable immediately as of the issue date of April 22, 1998. Because
these warrants are considered equity issuance costs, no value was recorded since
the net impact on Shareholders' equity would have been zero.
Stock Option Plan
On April 16, 1997, the Board of Directors approved a Stock Option Plan the
Plan and initially reserved 2,000,000 shares for issuance thereunder. In
January 2000, the Board of Directors and the shareholders approved an amendment
to reserve an additional 800,000 shares for issuance under the Plan. As of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, 774,116 and 711,463 shares remain available for
future grant, respectively. Under the Plan, as amended, incentive stock options
may be granted to employees, and nonstatutory stock options may be granted to
employees, directors and consultants. Options are granted at an exercise price
of not less than the fair value per share of the common stock on the date of
grant and expire not later than ten years from the date of grant. The options
may be exercised immediately upon grant, however, the shares issuable upon
exercise of the options are subject to a lapsing right of repurchase by the
Company. Options under the Plan generally vest 25% one year after the date of
grant and then on a pro rata basis over the following 36 months. An aggregate of
476,073 and 483,205 shares are subject to repurchase at an aggregate repurchase
price of $438,511 and $102,919 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Such repurchase rights will lapse at a minimum rate of 25% per annum and over a
period of time not to exceed four years from the date the option was granted.
The Plan also provides for annual increases in the number of shares available
for issuance under the Plan on the first business day of each year, beginning
January 1, 2001, equal to the lesser of 1,000,000 shares, 30% of the
outstanding shares on the date of the annual increase or such amount as may be
determined by the Board see Note 14.
Pro forma net loss and net loss per share information has been determined
as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted under the
fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair value of these options was estimated at
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the
following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 60%, 60%
and 575% for grants in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively; a
weighted-average expected life of five years; and a dividend yield of zero. The
weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2000, 1999, and 1998 was
$422, $299 and $005, respectively. The expected volatility of the Company
common stock used in the pricing model was 14 for 2000.

the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. Because the Company employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee
stock options.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In April 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2000, a total of 200,000
shares of the Company common stock have been reserved for issuance under the
Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common
stock at a discount up to a maximum of 15% of compensation through payroll
deductions during defined offering periods. The price at which stock is
purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85% of the fair market value of
the common stock on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is
lower. The initial offering period commenced on the effective date of the
initial public offering June 21, 2000 and will end in June 2002. An initial
purchase of 70,401 shares was made on December 29, 2000 with net proceeds to the
Company of $359,000. The Purchase Plan also provides for annual increases in the
number of shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan on the first
business day of each year, beginning January 1, 2001, equal to the lesser of
200,000 shares, 075% of the outstanding shares on the date of the annual
increase or such amount as may be determined by the Board see Note 14.
Stock-Based Compensation
During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, in connection with stock
option grants to employees and directors, deferred stock compensation was
recorded totaling $6,264,725 and $736,005, respectively, representing the
difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock for financial
reporting purposes and the exercise price of the underlying options. This amount
is recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity and is being amortized over
the vesting period of the individual options, generally four years. The Company
recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of $3,579,130 and $183,539
for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
During the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company
granted 10,100, 4,800 and 21,200 nonqualified common stock options to
consultants at exercise prices that range from $012 to $600 per share for
services rendered, respectively. Such options are included in the option tables
disclosed above. The options generally vest over two years and have expiration
dates, which range from the end of the term of the consulting agreements to ten
years after the grant date. Expense of approximately $510,000 and $30,000 was
recognized in 2000 and 1999, respectively, related to these grants. The related
expense in 1998 was not material. The fair value of these options was estimated
using the Black-Scholes model, with the following weighted-average assumptions:
risk-free interest rate of 60%, 60% and 575% for grants in fiscal 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively; the remaining contractual life which ranges from 8 to 10
years; a dividend yield of zero and expected volatility of the Company common
stock of 14.

In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation -- an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 FIN 44, which,
among other issues, addresses repricing and other modifications made to
previously issued stock options. We adopted FIN 44 in July 2000. The original
terms of certain stock options granted to employees were modified at a date
subsequent to the date of grant. Such modification resulted in new measurement
dates for accounting purposes. Accordingly, approximately $770,000 was recorded
as stock-based compensation, and such amounts have been included in the research
and development expenses in the accompanying 2000 consolidated financial
statements.

12. INCOME TAXES
The Company has no provision for U.S. federal or state income taxes for any
period as it has incurred operating losses in all periods and for all
jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2000, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards
for federal income tax purposes of approximately $21,000,000 which expire in the
years 2010 through 2020, and federal research and development tax credits of
approximately $300,000 which expire in the years 2011 through 2020.
Utilization of the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be
subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual
limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits
before utilization.
Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets are as follows                                  DECEMBER 31,

have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance
increased by approximately $4,100,000, $3,000,000, and $1,500,000, during the
periods ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
