REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
Board of Directors and Stockholders
MetaCreations Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
MetaCreations Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company as of December
31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

METACREATIONS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION
MetaCreations Corporation MetaCreations or the Company is focused on
developing and marketing 2D and 3D visualization software for graphic artists,
and the World Wide Web. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of MetaCreations and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
In May 1997, the stockholders of MetaTools, Inc. MetaTools approved the
Amendment to Restated Articles of Incorporation, changing the name of the
Company to MetaCreations Corporation. Accordingly, the term Company, as used
herein, refers to either MetaTools or MetaCreations, depending on the context of
the discussion.
The computer graphics imaging and visual computing markets, and the
personal computer industry in general, are characterized by rapidly changing
technology, resulting in short product life cycles and price declines. The
Company must continuously update its existing products to keep them current with
changing technology and must develop new products to take advantage of new
technologies that could render the Company existing products obsolete. The
Company future prospects are highly dependent on its ability to keep pace with
its competitors' innovations, to adapt to new operating systems, hardware
platforms, and emerging industry standards, and to provide additional
functionality to the Company existing products. The inability of the Company
to develop and introduce such products in a timely manner would have a material
adverse effect on the Company future business, operating results, financial
condition, and cash flows.
In May 1997, the stockholders of MetaCreations and Fractal Design
Corporation Fractal approved the merger of the two companies. As a result of
the merger, the Company issued approximately 9,055,000 shares of MetaCreations
common stock for all of the outstanding shares of Fractal and assumed
approximately 1,653,000 options to purchase Fractal common stock. The merger was
accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements were restated to include the accounts of Fractal for all
periods presented.
The Company reports its financial results on a December 31 fiscal year-end
basis, whereas Fractal reported its financial results on a March 31 fiscal
year-end basis. For the purposes of pooling-of-interests accounting, the balance
sheet of the Company as of December 31, 1996 has been combined with that of
Fractal as of March 31, 1997. The statements of operations of the Company for
the year ended December 31, 1996 has been combined with that of Fractal for the
year ended March 31, 1997. Accordingly, Fractal net loss of $513,000 for the
three months ended March 31, 1997 has been reflected as an adjustment to
retained earnings. The results of operations of Fractal for such three month
period include net revenues of $7,004,000.
Separate results of operations for the period presented is as follows in
thousands:

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue Recognition
During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of
Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-4,
Deferral of the Effective Date of Certain Provisions of SOP 97-2. SOP 97-2 and
SOP 98-4, which supercede SOP 91-1, generally require revenue earned on software
arrangements involving multiple elements e.g., software products,
upgrades/enhancements, postcontract customer support, etc. to be allocated to
each element based on the relative fair value of the elements. The fair value of
an element must be based on evidence which is specific to the Company. The
Company recognizes product revenues upon shipment to the customer, satisfaction
of Company obligations, if any, and reasonable assurance regarding the
collectability of the corresponding receivable. Revenue allocated to
postcontract customer support is recognized ratably over the term of the
support. If the Company does not have evidence of the fair value for all
elements in a multiple-element arrangement, all revenue from the arrangement is
deferred until such evidence exists or until all elements are delivered. The
impact of adopting SOP 97-2 and SOP 98-4 was not material to the Company
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The Company provides an allowance for estimated returns at the time of
product shipments and adjusts this allowance as needed based on actual return
history. Such reserves as a percentage of net revenues have varied over recent
years, reflecting the Company experience in product returns as it has
significantly expanded the proportion of its sales through third-party
distribution channels and increased its product portfolio. The Company expects
reserves will continue to vary in the future. The Company agreements with its
distributors generally provide the distributors with limited rights to return
unsold inventories under a stock balancing program. The Company monitors the
activities of its distributors in an effort to minimize excessive returns and
establishes its reserves based on its estimates of expected returns. At December
31, 1998 and 1997, the Company had an allowance for potential returns of
approximately $1,720,000 and $2,034,000, respectively.
The Company has entered into agreements whereby it licenses products to
original equipment manufacturers OEM and foreign publishers which provide
such customers the right to produce and distribute multiple copies of its
software. Nonrefundable fixed fees are recognized as revenue at delivery of the
product master to the customer, satisfaction of Company obligations, if any, and
reasonable assurance regarding the collectability of the corresponding
receivable. Per copy royalties in excess of fixed amounts are recognized as
revenue when such amounts exceed fixed minimum royalties. Revenues under OEM
contracts without nonrefundable fixed fees are recognized as earned over the
term of the contract.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The Company monitors the activities of its distributors in an
effort to minimize excessive returns and establishes its reserves based on its
estimates of expected returns. While historically the Company returns have
been within management expectations, the establishing of reserves requires
judgments regarding such factors as future competitive conditions and product
life cycles, which can be difficult to predict. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Inventories
Inventories consist of finished products and software components, primarily
instruction manuals, diskettes, CD ROMs and packaging ready for assembly. The
Company periodically evaluates the carrying

value of its inventories, including a review for potentially excess or obsolete
products, and adjusts these as necessary. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the
Company had reserves of approximately $418,000 and $719,000, respectively, for
potentially excess or obsolete inventory items. Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out
method.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Assets are depreciated on the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 7
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the
lease or the life of the asset. Upon sale, any gain or loss is included in the
consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and minor replacements are
expensed as incurred.
Long-Term Assets
The carrying value of long-term assets, primarily consisting of property
and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets, is periodically reviewed
by management. Impairment losses, if any, are recognized when the expected
nondiscounted future operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than
their carrying value.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Software Development Costs
The Company provides for capitalization of certain software development
costs once technological feasibility is established. The costs so capitalized
are then amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated product life
generally eighteen months to three years, or on the ratio of current revenue
to total projected product revenues, whichever is greater. To date, the
establishment of technological feasibility of the Company products and general
release have substantially coincided. As a result, the Company has not
capitalized any internal software development costs since costs qualifying for
such capitalization have not been significant.
Advertising
The Company reports the costs of all advertising as expenses in the periods
in which those costs are incurred. The Company shares portions of certain
distributors' advertising expenses through co-op advertising arrangements.
Advertising expense, primarily consisting of co-op advertising, catalog
advertising, direct mailings, and placements in business and consumer
publications, was approximately $11,816,000, $12,060,000, and $10,315,000 for
the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 respectively.
Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
The Company considers its investment portfolio available-for-sale as
defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 115. These
available-for-sale securities are accounted for at their fair value, and
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, net unrealized
gains or losses on available-for-sale securities were not significant.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
The Company invests its cash in accordance with a policy that seeks to
maximize returns while ensuring both liquidity and minimal risk of principal
loss. The policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by
institutions with investment grade credit ratings, and places restrictions on
maturities and concentration by type and issuer. The majority of the Company
portfolio is composed of fixed income investments which are subject to the risk
of market interest rate fluctuations, and all of the Company investments are
subject to risks associated with the ability of the issuers to perform their
obligations under the instruments.
Royalty Expense
The Company licenses certain third-party software and code for inclusion in
its products. Royalties are payable to developers of the software or code at
various rates and amounts, generally based on net unit sales or net revenues.
These agreements may include royalty advances against future expected sales,
which advances are recorded as prepaid expenses until such royalties are earned.
Royalty expense, which is included as a component of cost of revenues, amounted
to approximately $1,302,000, $2,563,000, and $2,487,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.
Credit Risk
The Company sells its retail products domestically through unaffiliated
distributors and OEM, as well as directly to end-users. International sales
are generally made through distributors in each of the foreign countries in
which the Company markets its products. Credit is extended based on an
evaluation of each customer financial condition, and generally collateral is
not required. Estimated credit losses and returns, if any, have been provided
for in the financial statements and have generally been within management
expectations. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company has an allowance for
doubtful accounts of approximately $1,005,000 and $1,216,000, respectively.
At December 31, 1998, and periodically throughout 1996 to December 31,
1998, the Company has maintained balances with various financial institutions in
excess of the federally insured limits.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of each of the Company foreign subsidiaries is
its local currency. Financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are
translated to U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes using current rates of
exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates of exchange for revenues
and expenses. The effects of currency translation adjustments are included as a
component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses on foreign currency
translations for 1998, 1997, and 1996 were insignificant.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method as
required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees
with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of
grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

Net Income Loss Per Common Share
Basic net income loss per common share is computed using the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and diluted net income loss per
common share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common
stock and common equivalent shares outstanding. Common equivalent shares related
to stock options, warrants and preferred stock are excluded from the computation
when their effect is antidilutive.
Comprehensive Income
During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose
financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of
a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances from nonowner sources. Differences between comprehensive income
and net income were not material to the Company financial position, results of
operations or cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996.
Segment Information and Enterprise-Wide Disclosures
During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No.
131 supercedes SFAS No. 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business
Enterprise, replacing the industry segment approach with the management
approach. The management approach designates the internal organization that is
used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as
the source of the Company reportable segments. Specific information to be
reported for individual segments includes profit or loss, certain revenue and
expense items and total assets. SFAS No. 131 also requires disclosures about
products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The adoption of
SFAS No. 131 did not have a material impact on the Company financial position,
results of operations or cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997,
and 1996, but did affect enterprise-wide disclosures for the respective periods

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1997 consolidated financial
statements to conform to the 1998 presentation.
3. RESTRUCTURING
On June 30, 1998, the Company announced a restructuring plan aimed at
reducing costs and improving competitiveness and efficiency, which was
implemented during the third quarter of 1998. In connection with the
restructuring, management considered the Company future operating costs and
levels of revenue in 1998 and beyond, and determined that a restructuring charge
of approximately $4,955,000 was required to cover the costs of reducing certain
sectors of its workforce and facilities. The restructuring charge included an
accrual of approximately $2,208,000 related to severance and benefits associated
with the reduction of approximately 75 positions during July 1998, as well as
the related reduction of certain of the Company facilities. Non-cash
restructuring costs, which totaled approximately $2,747,000, primarily related
to the write-down of non-strategic business assets made redundant or obsolete
due to the streamlining of the Company product lines and/or reduction of
facilities. The Company expects completion of the restructuring plan during the
first quarter of 1999.

purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, together with net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant components of the
Company deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows in thousands:

The valuation allowance for deferred taxes was increased approximately
$5,191,000 during 1998 based on management assessment of the recoverability of
the deferred tax assets. Management assessment included an evaluation of the
Company deferred income tax assets; available tax carrybacks; cumulative net
income, excluding costs related to mergers and acquisitions; available tax
planning strategies; and future financial statement projections. Based on this
assessment and interpretation of the provisions of SFAS No. 109, management has
concluded that additional net operating losses and other tax benefits generated
during 1998 require a valuation allowance. Management assessment with respect
to the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may be revised over
the near term based on actual operating results and revised financial statement
projections.
For 1997, the valuation allowance for deferred taxes decreased
approximately $353,000, primarily as a result of the recognition of a state
deferred tax asset. At December 31, 1997, a valuation allowance was placed
against the net operating losses of RTG due to potential limitations on the
Company ability to utilize the loss carryforwards in light of RTG earnings
history and pursuant to the ownership rule changes of the Internal Revenue Code,
Section 382.

during the year ended December 31, 1998. The Company also has net operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $10,678,000 and $503,000,
respectively, for state income tax purposes, which begin expiring in 2001. The

Additionally, the Company has net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $5,667,000 and $192,000, respectively, for foreign income tax
purposes, which do not expire. The Company foreign net operating loss
carryforward relates to net losses incurred by the Company Irish subsidiary
during the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997. The net operating loss
carryforwards may be used to offset any future taxable income, subject to

pursuant to the ownership rule changes of the Internal Revenue Code, Section
382.
