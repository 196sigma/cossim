Mine Safety Disclosures 24  PART II Item5.Controls and Procedures     aDisclosure Controls and Procedures 
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of June30, 2013. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act,
means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June30, 2013, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. 
bManagement Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company
principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures
that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2013
and concluded that, as of June30, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Aspen Technology,Inc.: 
We
have audited Aspen Technology,Inc. and subsidiaries the Company internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In
our opinion, the Company maintained in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of
June30, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended June30, 2013, and our report dated August15, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/
