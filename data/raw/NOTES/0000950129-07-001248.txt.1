44 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Stockholders of INX Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
INX Inc. formerly
I-Sector
Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2006. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of INX Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31,
2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.   As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January1, 2006 the Company adopted
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payments.
Also as discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment
as of January1, 2006, in connection with the adoption of
SEC Staff Accounting BulletinNo108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements.   /s/GRANT

Description
of Business   INX Inc. INX or the Company is a
provider of IP communications solutions for enterprise-class
organizations based primarily on Cisco System, Inc. technology.
These solutions include design, implementation and support of
LAN/WAN routing and switching, IP telephony, voice over IP
VoIP, network security, network storage and
wireless networks. Effective December31, 2005, the Company
merged its wholly owned InterNetwork Experts, Inc. subsidiary
with
I-Sector
Corporation and changed its name from
I-Sector
Corporation to INX Inc.   
2.
Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Basis of Presentation On November3,
2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to
sell the Stratasoft and Valerent subsidiaries as further
discussed in Note4. Therefore, the Stratasoft and Valerent
results of operations and cash flows are classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets
and liabilities of Stratasoft and Valerent are classified as
current and noncurrent assets and liabilities of discontinued
operations in the accompanying balance sheets for all periods
presented. As a result of the classification of Stratasoft and
Valerent as discontinued operations, the Company reports under
only one segment.   Principles of Consolidation The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of INX
Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.   Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents
are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with maturity
of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains
its cash in bank deposit accounts, which at times, may exceed
federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any
losses in such accounts.   Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable
are recorded at the invoiced amount, are non-interest bearing
and are recorded net of reserves for sales returns and
allowances and an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company
extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business
and generally does not require collateral or other security. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers financial condition and, in some instances,
requires letters of credit or additional guarantees in support
of contracted amounts. Earnings are charged with a provision for
doubtful accounts based on a current review of the
collectibility of the accounts and using a systematic approach
based on historical collections and age of the amounts due.
Accounts deemed uncollectible are applied against the allowance
for doubtful accounts. Accruals for estimated sales returns and
other allowances and deferrals are recorded as a reduction of
revenue at the time of revenue recognition. These provisions are
based on contract terms and prior claims experience and involve
significant estimates.   Inventory Inventory consists primarily of
Cisco network equipment, computer equipment and components and
is valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on
the first-in
first-out method. Substantially all inventory is finished goods.
Reserves to reduce inventory to market value are based on
current inventory levels, historical usage and product life
cycles.   Property and Equipment Property and equipment
are recorded at cost. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance
are charged to expense when incurred, while expenditures for
betterments are capitalized. Disposals are removed at cost less
accumulated depreciation with the resulting gain or loss
reflected in operations in the year of disposal.   Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the
purchase price over the fair values assigned to the net assets
acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized,
but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more
frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying
values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values. Goodwill is
written down when impaired. Based on the impairment tests
performed, there was no impairment of goodwill in 2006.   Intangible Assets Intangible assets are being
amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to four years
see Note6.

AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Impairment
losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when
events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be
impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of
those assets.   Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for
under the liability method, which requires, among other things,
recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in the consolidated financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred income tax liabilities and
assets are determined based on the temporary differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of
existing assets and liabilities and the recognition of available
tax carryforwards. The tax provision allocated to discontinued
operations is based on the incremental tax effect after
computing the tax provision on continuing operations.   Use of Estimates The preparation of the
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenue and expense during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.   Revenue Recognition INX recognizes revenue as
follows   Products revenue occurs when products manufactured or
otherwise provided by other parties are purchased and resold to
a customer and product payment is not contingent upon
performance of installation or service obligations. If product
acceptance and payment are contingent on installation or service
obligations as specified in the customer contract, revenue is
not recognized until installation occurs. Revenue is recognized
from the sales of hardware when the rights and risks of
ownership have passed to the customer and upon shipment or
receipt by the customer, depending on the terms of the sales
contract with the customer. The Company recognizes revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Amounts
billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as
revenue.   The Company sells hardware maintenance contracts that are
serviced and supported solely by a third party, who is the
primary obligor of these contracts. There are multiple factors
under
EITF99-19,
but the primary obligor is a strong factor in determining
whether the Company acts as a principal or agent and whether
gross or net revenue presentation is appropriate. As the Company
has concluded that it is more of an agent in the sale of
hardware maintenance contract, revenue is reported by the
Company net of the cost of the hardware maintenance contract
from the third party.   For arrangements where the customer agrees to purchase products
but we retain possession until the customer requests shipment,
or bill and hold arrangements, revenue is not
recognized until delivery to the customer has occurred and all
other revenue recognition criteria have been met.   Software is accounted for in accordance with Statement of
Position No.
97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, and all related
interpretations. Revenue from the sales of software not
requiring significant modification or customization is
recognized upon delivery or installation. Installation services
for third party software do not include significant alterations
to its features or functionality. Third party software vendors
provide all post-contract support for software sold by the
Company. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.   Technical support services revenue, consisting of remote
monitoring and management of customers IP telephony and
network infrastructure equipment and applications, is recognized
ratably over the term of

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   the underlying customer contract. Commission costs paid in
advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the
underlying customer contract.   Revenue for fixed and flat fee services contracts related
to customized network and IP telephony solutions are recognized
under a proportional performance model utilizing an input based
approach labor hours. The Companys contracts function
similar to a time and materials type contract and generally do
not specify or quantify interim deliverables or milestones. Such
service contracts encompass the design and installation of IP
telephony and computer networks under which customers receive
the benefit of services provided over the period of contract
performance.   Other service revenue is earned from providing
stand-alone services such as billings for engineering and
technician time, installation and programming services, which
are provided on either an hourly basis or a flat-fee basis, and
the service component of maintenance and repair service ticket
transactions. These services are contracted for separately from
any product sale. Other service revenues are recognized when the
service is performed and when collection is reasonably assured.
Revenue arrangements generally do not include specific customer
acceptance criteria. In instances where final acceptance of the
system or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is
deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.   Arrangements with multiple deliverables are arrangements
under which a combination of products and services are provided
to customers. Such arrangements are evaluated under Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No.
00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,
EITF
00-21,
which addresses certain aspects of accounting by a vendor for
arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple
revenue generating activities. The application of the
appropriate accounting guidance requires judgment and is
dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale
includes hardware, software, services or a combination of these
items.   The Company enters into product and service contracts for
customers that are generally considered a single arrangement and
which include separate units of accounting for product and for
service. Product primarily consists of IP telephony and computer
network infrastructure components and third party software.
Service encompasses the design and installation of IP telephony
and computer networks and installation of third party software.
Installation services for third party software do not include
significant alterations to its features or functionality. All
products and services are regularly sold separately. For
products and services sold in a single arrangement, the product
is typically delivered first and the related services are
completed within four to six weeks. Product is shipped, billed,
and recognized as revenue independent of services because   
The customer is required to pay the product billing in its
entirety independent of any services performed.   
The product has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and
pricing is comparable whether sold with or without services.   
The product is standard equipment not significantly altered by
installation.   
Installation of the product can be performed by many other
companies.   
Although there is a general right of return relative to
delivered product, delivery of the undelivered items is
considered probable and is substantially in the control of the
Company.   The Company recognizes revenue for multiple element arrangements
based on the relative fair value of the separate elements.
Comparable products and services are sold on a stand alone basis
and under multiple element arrangements at the same prices.
Stand alone pricing is vendor-specific objective evidence under
EITF 00-21.
Customers are not required to and frequently do not select the
same vendor

impact the pricing of the portion of the bid selected.   Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to
determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents
and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify
delivery. Determination that the fee is fixed or determinable is
based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and
whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.   The Company records taxes applicable under EITF

Collectibility is assessed based primarily on the
creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks
and analysis, as well as the customers payment history.
Accruals for estimated sales returns and other allowances and
deferrals are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of
revenue recognition. These provisions are based on contract
terms and prior claims experience and involve significant
estimates. If these estimates are significantly different from
actual results, our revenue could be impacted.   Vendor Incentives INX participates in a
vendor incentive program under which incentives are principally
earned by sales volume, sales growth and customer satisfaction
levels. The amounts earned under these programs are accrued when
they are deemed probable and can be reasonably measured;
otherwise, they are recorded when they are declared by the
vendor or the cash is received, whichever is earlier. As a
result of these estimates, the amount of rebates declared by the
vendor, or the amount of rebates received in cash, the effect of
vendor incentives on cost of goods can vary significantly
between quarterly and annual reporting periods. The incentives
are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods and services.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are increased for
any associated commission expense and payroll tax related to the
incentives. The Company recognized vendor incentives of $6,303,
$2,876 and $3,480 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During
the fourth quarter of 2006, additional incentives of $691 were
recorded as a change in estimate increasing 2006 income from
continuing operations and net income by $691 or $011per
share basic and $009per share fully diluted. Accounts
receivable from vendors of $3,280 and $1,217 at
December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are reported
under Accounts receivable trade in the
consolidated balance sheets.   Advertising Costs Advertising costs consist
of print advertising and trade show materials and are expensed
as incurred.   Research and Development Costs Research and
development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred
and consist primarily of compensation costs, outside services,
and expensed materials. The Company incurred research and
development expenditures of $289, $162 and $0 in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.   Share-Based Compensation On January1,
2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment, SFAS123R which requires the
measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on
estimated fair values for share-based payment awards.
SFAS123R supersedes the Companys previous accounting
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB25 for periods beginning in 2006. In
March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting BulletinNo107 SAB107

guidance of SAB107 in its adoption of SFAS123R.   SFAS123R requires all share-based payments to be
recognized in the results of operations at their grant-date fair
values. The Company adopted SFAS123R using the modified
prospective transition method, which requires the application of
the accounting standard as of January1, 2006, the first
day of the Companys 2006 fiscal year. Under

See Note7.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments
INXs financial instruments consist of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable for which
the carrying values approximate fair values given the short-term
maturity of the instruments. The carrying value of the
Companys debt instruments approximate their fair value
based on estimates of rates offered to the Company for
instruments with the same maturity dates and security structures.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June
2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FIN48. FIN48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises
financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. This Interpretation also provides related guidance
on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods and disclosure. FIN48 is
effective for the Company beginning January1, 2007. The
adoption of FIN48 is not expected to have a material
effect on the Companys financial statements.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements. This statement clarifies
the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures on fair value
measurements. SFASNo157 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November15, 2007. The adoption of
SFAS157 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated financial statements.   In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo108 SAB108.
SAB108 provides guidance on the consideration of prior
year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for
the purpose of a materiality assessment. The staff believes
registrants must quantify the impact of correcting all
misstatements, including both carryover and reversing effects of
prior year misstatements, on the Companys current year
consolidated financial statements. The staff prescribes two
approaches to assessing the materially of misstatements; the
rollover approach, which quantifies misstatements
based on the amount of error originating in the current year
income statement and the iron curtain approach,
which quantifies misstatements based on the effects of
correcting the cumulative effect existing in the balance sheet
at the end of the current year. If under either approach,
misstatements are deemed material, the Company is required to
adjust its financial statements, including correcting prior year
financial statements, even though such correction was and
continues to be immaterial to the prior year financial
statements. Correcting prior year financial statements for
immaterial errors would not require the Company to amend
previously filed reports, rather such corrections may be made
the next time the Company files its prior year statements.   Since inception the Company recorded audit professional fees in
the year under audit and tax professional fees in the year for
which the tax returns were filed. Generally accepted accounting
principles require audit and tax professional fees to be
expensed as incurred, which are primarily in the year subsequent
to the year under audit or year for which tax returns are filed.
Prior to 2006, the difference between the two methods was
immaterial to the Companys financial position and results
of operations. Applying the guidance of SAB108, the
Company corrected its accounting for audit and tax fees in 2006
by reducing January1, 2006 accrued expenses and retained
deficit in the amount of $125 for the cumulative effect of the
correction.

Acquisitions   The Company completed an acquisition in February, 2006 and two
acquisitions during May and June, 2005. The acquisitions were
consummated to improve the Companys geographical presence
and enhance its technical capabilities.   Datatran
Network Systems   Under an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February3, 2006,
the Company purchased the assets and operations of Datatran
Network Systems DNS. DNS is a specialized provider
of network solutions serving the Southern California market. DNS
designs, implements and supports solutions based on Cisco
technologies with a primary focus on IP Telephony. The Company
completed the acquisition simultaneously with the execution of
the Asset Purchase Agreement.   The consideration paid at closing pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement was $1,000 in cash, including $100 placed in escrow
under holdback provisions defined in the Asset Purchase
Agreement and 71,003shares of the Companys common
stock valued at $500. Legal and other costs of $47 were paid in
connection with the transaction, of which $32 was paid in cash
and $15 was paid through the issuance of 2,105shares of
common stock. The calculation of the 71,003shares of the
Companys common stock was determined by dividing $500 by
the greater of iaverage closing price per share for the
Common Stock as reported by AMEX for the five consecutive
trading days ending prior to February1, 2006 or

office revenue during the twelve-month period ending
February28, 2007. If the revenue for that period
iequals or exceeds $9,000 but is less than $9,250, then
the amount of the additional purchase consideration will be
$125, iiequals or exceeds $9,250 but is less than
$9,500, then the amount of the additional purchase consideration

additional purchase consideration. At the Companys option,
50% of any additional purchase price consideration, if any, may
be paid in the form of common stock. Additional purchase price
consideration, if any, will be recorded as goodwill.   Network
Architects, Corp.   Effective May26, 2005, the Company acquired the operations
and certain assets of Network Architects, Corp. Network
Architects, a data network and IP telephony systems
design, installation and support business with branches in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, and ElPaso, Texas. The
consideration paid at closing consisted of cash in the amount of
$2,000, common stock valued at $2,000, and payment of a note
payable to a bank in the amount of $300. Legal and other costs
of $65 were paid in cash in connection with the transaction. The
calculation of the 308,166shares of Companys common
stock issued was determined by dividing $2,000 by the average
closing price per share for the Common Stock as reported by AMEX
for the five consecutive trading days ending May20, 2005.   Additional purchase price consideration valued at $965 and
recorded as goodwill was paid to Network Architects in June 2006
for achievement of certain operating profit milestones during
the twelve-month period ended May31, 2006. The
consideration was comprised of $394 paid in cash and
97,413shares of the Companys common stock valued at
the average closing price per share as reported by NASDAQ for
the five consecutive trading days ending June28, 2006.   The Company will pay Network Architects additional purchase
price consideration if certain financial milestones are achieved
during 2007 and 2008. The Company will issue Network Architects
a maximum of 75,000shares of common stock following each
of the twelve-month periods ending May31, 2007 and 2008 if
operating profit during such periods exceeds $660 and $726,

Operations   Telecom
and Computer Products Divisions   Prior to 2004, INX sold a computer products reselling business,
PBX telephone systems dealer business, and the Telecom Systems
division. During 2005, the Company resolved the collectibility
of certain accounts receivable of these operations and, in 2006,
settled pending litigation relative to its discontinued Telecom
and Computer Products Divisions as discussed further in
Note14. The impact of these changes are reflected in the
gain on disposal of discontinued operations detailed below.   Stratasoft
and Valerent Subsidiaries   On November3, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors
approved a plan to sell its Stratasoft and Valerent
subsidiaries. This action was taken due to continuing losses at
Stratasoft and the decision to build value with a focused
strategy in the operations at INX. Under a Stock Purchase
Agreement Agreement dated January26, 2006,
INX sold all outstanding shares of Stratasofts common
stock for a pretax gain on disposal of $302. Key terms of the
sale are summarized as follows   
All outstanding Stratasoft common stock was sold for a purchase
price of $3,000, which has been or is subject to reduction as
follows   
$800 placed in escrow, which is available to satisfy indemnified
losses, if any, as defined in the Agreement. Funds placed in

The Company indemnified the buyer for potential losses as
defined in the Agreement to a maximum of $1,400, inclusive of
amounts placed in escrow. Excess funds held in escrow will be

The Company may receive additional cash consideration if
Stratasoft is sold by the buyer to another party prior to
January26, 2008, for an amount in excess of $15,000.   Transaction costs of $815 were incurred by the Company in

space leased by INX that will not be subleased to Stratasoft in
the future.   The sale of Valerent operations involved two separate
transactions which were closed in October 2006. The managed
services business and related inventory, property and equipment
were sold to OuterNet Management, L.P. for a cash sales price of
$185. The consulting business and related property and equipment

7   Prior to 2005, the discontinued Stratasoft subsidiary recognized
revenue under the percentage of completion method based on the
relationship of total cost incurred to total estimated cost over
the duration of the project. Effective January1, 2005, the
Stratasoft segment changed its method of applying the percentage
of completion accounting method to the relationship of labor
cost incurred to total estimated labor cost over the duration of
the project. Management believes the newly adopted method of
applying the accounting principle is preferable in
Stratasofts circumstances because using labor cost as the
input measure more accurately reflects the labor intensive
customization and modification that now occurs to the Stratasoft
hardware and software more evenly over the duration of
Stratasofts projects. Accordingly, the labor cost input
method more appropriately measures the progress towards
completion over the duration of Stratasofts projects.   The change in accounting method was applied by recording the
cumulative effect of the change amounting to $566 in the loss
from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December31, 2005. Had the
change in accounting method not been made, net loss for the year
ended December31, 2005 would have decreased by $144 or
$003per share basic and diluted. The pro forma effect
has not been presented for prior periods due to the inability to
accurately compute the effect of the change prior to
December31, 2004.

Earnings
Per Share   Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income loss by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding during each period and the assumed exercise
of dilutive stock options and warrants less the number of
treasury shares assumed to be purchased from the proceeds using
the average market price of the Companys common stock for
each of the periods presented.   Options to purchase 1,154,007shares for the year ended
December31, 2005 were not used in the calculation of
diluted earnings since the effect of potentially dilutive
securities in computing a loss per share is antidilutive. For

4,609     2,707   On December27, 2005 the Company entered into a $40,000
senior credit facility Agreement with Castle Pines
Capital LLC CPC to provide inventory financing and
to fund working capital requirements, replacing the $25,000
senior credit facility with Textron Financial Corporation. Key
terms of the Agreement are summarized as follows   
The Agreement provides a discretionary line of credit up to a
maximum aggregate amount of $40,000 to purchase inventory from
CPC approved vendors.   
The Agreement provides a working capital revolving line of
credit under the above line of credit with an aggregate
outstanding sublimit of $10,000.   
The working capital revolving line of credit incurs interest
payable monthly at the rate of prime plus 5%.   
The Agreement contains customary covenants regarding maintenance
of insurance coverage, maintenance of and reporting collateral,
and submission of financial statements. The Agreement also
contains restrictive financial covenants measured as of the end
of each calendar quarter covering current ratio, tangible net
worth, minimum working capital, and total liabilities to
tangible net worth ratio as defined.   
The line of credit is collateralized by substantially all assets
of the Company.   Inventory floor plan borrowings are reflected in accounts
payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, except
for $4,350 and $2,464 that is interest bearing and is reflected
in short term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets at December31, 2006 and December31, 2005,
respectively. Borrowings accrue interest at the prime rate
825% at December31, 2006plus 05% on outstanding
balances that extend beyond the vendor approved free interest
period. At December31, 2006, INX was in compliance with
the loan covenants effective at that date and anticipates that
it will be able to comply with its loan covenants for the next
twelve months. In the event INX does not maintain compliance, it
would be required to seek waivers from CPC for those events,
which, if not obtained, could accelerate repayment and require
INX to seek other sources of finance. At December31, 2006,
INX had $30,341 outstanding on inventory floor plan finance
borrowings, and the unused availability was $1,482.   The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings under all
credit line arrangements in effect during, 2006, 2005 and 2004
was 85%, 86% and 74%, respectively. Interest expense on
continuing operations debt was $255, $289, and $193 for the
years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

STATEMENTSContinued   Due to the companys recurring losses, a valuation
allowance was established to fully offset the net deferred tax
assets at December31, 2006 and 2005. The increase in the
valuation allowance in 2006 was primarily attributable to an
increase in deferred tax assets associated with the
remeasurement of stock options that were part of the elimination
of minority interest in our former Internetwork Experts, Inc.
subsidiary and includes a $648 decrease in deferred tax assets
associated with the disposal of discontinuing operations.   At December31, 2006, INX has a net operating loss NOL
carryforward for federal income tax reporting purposes of
approximately $2,369. Since United States tax laws limit the
time during which an NOL may be applied against future taxable
income and tax liabilities, INX may not be able to take full
advantage of its NOL carryforward for federal income tax
purposes. The carryforward will expire during the period 2023
through 2025 if not otherwise used. A change in ownership, as
defined by federal income tax regulations, could significantly
limit the companys ability to utilize its carryforward.   INX receives an income tax benefit from stock option exercises
for the difference between the fair market value of the stock
issued at the time of exercise and the grant price, tax
effected. This benefit will be utilized to the extent that INX
has tax basis income that was not offset by the remainder of the
net operating loss NOL carryforwards. At December31,
2006, INX has $605 remaining unused tax benefit attributable to
stock option exercises.

the 1996 Incentive Plan and the 1996 Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan were
approved by the shareholders and no further shares may be
granted under either plan. The 1996 Incentive Plan provided for
the granting of incentive awards in the form of stock options,
restricted stock, phantom stock, stock bonuses and cash bonuses
in accordance with the provisions of the plan. The Director Plan
provided for a one-time option by newly elected directors to
purchase up to 5,000 common shares, after which each director
was entitled to receive an option to purchase up to 5,000 common
shares upon each date of re-election to INXs Board of
Directors. Options granted under the Director Plan and the 1996
Incentive Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair market
value on the date of grant, are fully vested at
December31, 2006, and generally expire ten years after the
grant date.   2000 Stock Incentive Plan INX adopted the
2000 Stock Incentive Plan the 2000 Incentive Plan
as approved at the May 2000 annual shareholders meeting.
At the June5, 2006shareholders meeting the
2000 Incentive Plan was amended to increase the number of shares
of common stock available for stock option grants to 2,473,103.
The 2000 Incentive Plan provides for the granting of incentive
awards in the form of stock-based awards and cash bonuses in
accordance with the provisions of the plan. All employees,
including officers, and consultants and non-employee directors
are eligible to participate in the 2000 Incentive Plan.
Generally, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to
determine the exercise price of each stock option under the 2000
Incentive Plan, and they expire within ten years of the grant
date, except those classified as Incentive Stock Option
ISO grants to a 10% or greater stockholder. ISO
grants to a 10% or greater stockholder expire within five years
of the grant date. The exercise price of each ISO grant may not
be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of common
stock on the date of grant 110% in the case of a 10% or greater
stockholder. Options granted under the 2000 Incentive Plan are
subject to either cliff or graded vesting, generally ranging
from three to ten years. At December31, 2006,
168,189shares were available for future option grants
under the 2000 Incentive Plan.

Fair Value   The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
calculate the grant-date fair value of an award. The fair value
of options granted during the 2006, 2005 and 2004 periods were
calculated using the following estimated weighted average
assumptions   	
2006   2005   2004   Expected volatility

period IP communications solutions was the primary line of
business of the Company. Beginning in 2006, the Company used the
simplified method outlined in SAB107 to estimate expected
lives for options granted during the period. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the yield on zero-coupon
U.S.Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate
with the expected term assumption. The Company has not
historically issued any dividends and does not expect to in the
future.   Share-Based
Compensation Expense   The Company uses the straight-line attribution method to
recognize expense for unvested options. The amount of
share-based compensation recognized during a period is based on
the value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
SFAS123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time
of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company will
re-evaluate the forfeiture rate annually and adjust it as
necessary, and the adjustments could be material.   Share-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS123R
for the year ended December31, 2006 was as follows   	
Cost of products and

No.FAS123R-3
Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects
of Share-Based Payment Awards. The Company has elected to
adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FASB
Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of stock-based
compensation pursuant to SFAS123R. The alternative
transition method includes simplified methods to establish the
beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool
APIC pool related to the tax effects of employee
stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact
on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of
the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that
are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS123R. SFAS123R
also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing
cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed
under the prior accounting rules. This requirement reduces net
operating cash flows and increases net financing cash flows in
periods after adoption. Total cash flow remains unchanged from
what would have been reported under prior accounting rules.
Since no tax benefit was recorded for share-based payment awards
in the year ended December31, 2006, the aforementioned
provisions of SFAS123R and the related FASB Staff Position
No.FAS123R-3
had no impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   Capital Stock Holders of INXs common
stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be
voted on by shareholders and are entitled to receive dividends,

remaining available for distribution to shareholders after
payment of all liabilities. There are no shares of preferred
stock issued or outstanding.   Completion of Public Offering On May12,
2004, the Company closed a public offering of 500,000 Units.
Each Unit consists of two shares of common stock and one warrant
to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $1245. The
Units were offered at a public offering price of $1660per
Unit resulting in $8,300 of proceeds less 9% underwriter
discount of $747 and underwriter expenses of $9 for a net amount
of $7,544 before additional offering expenses. On June2,
2004, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase 75,000
additional Units to cover over-allotments resulting in $1,245 of
proceeds less 9% underwriter discount of $112 for a net amount
of $1,133 before additional offering expenses. The Company paid
approximately $1,145 of additional offering expenses associated
with the public offering as of December31, 2004. Net
proceeds after all discounts and expenses were approximately
$7,548.   Warrants Included in the units issued by INX
on May7, 2004 were 575,000 warrants to purchase common
stock at an exercise price of $1245per share. These
warrants are exercisable through May7, 2009 and are

The holder of the representatives warrant will have, in
that capacity, no voting, dividend or other stockholder rights.   In January 2007 INX issued warrants to an investor relations

50,000shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to
$800per share expiring January1, 2009. Warrants for
25,000shares are exercisable immediately and will result

InterNetwork Experts, Inc. shares held by a minority shareholder
group in exchange for 244,890shares of INX common stock.
The transaction was recorded using the purchase method of
accounting, resulting in recognition of goodwill of $1,408
including transaction costs of $180, elimination of $302 in
minority interests, and an increase in common stock and
additional
paid-in-capital
of $1,530. In connection with the transaction, InterNetwork
Experts, Inc. stock options were exchanged for INX stock
options, requiring remeasurement of the stock options as of the
date of exchange. The resulting $5,729 charge to earnings was
reflected as an increase in selling, general, and administrative
expenses with a corresponding increase in additional
paid-in-capital
and therefore had no impact on total stockholders equity.

advance written notice is given by the Company, a termination
fee of one months base rent is immediately payable, and if
180days of advance written notice is given by the Company,
a termination fee of two months base rent is immediately
payable.   
At any time during the term of the lease, Allstar has the right
to pay the Company in cash the amount of unamortized buildout
allowance, after which the monthly basic rent payable under the
lease increases from $20 to $21 for the remaining term of the
lease.   
The Company has the option to renew the lease for two additional
terms of five years each at the lesser of the then prevailing
fair market rental rate or 105% of the base rent under the New
Lease.   The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors engaged the
services of an independent real estate consultant to evaluate
the fair market rental and related lease terms for comparable
facilities in Houston. Based on the recommendations of the
independent consultant the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors approved the transactions contemplated by the New
Lease.   The Company paid for remodeling, parking lot repaving, and other
improvements of the building leased from Allstar totaling $267,
$8, and $12 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. The Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors approved the 2006 expenditures. Under the transition
to the new lease, sublease income earned by Allstar prior to
expiration of the current lease is payable to the Company. At
December31, 2006, a $26 sublease income receivable from
Allstar is recorded in the accompanying balance sheet, which was
paid to the Company in 2007.

and Contingencies   Litigation In August 2002, Inacom Corp.
Inacom filed a lawsuit in the District Court of
Douglas County, Nebraska styled Inacom Corpv.
I-Sector
Corporation, f/k/a Allstar Systems, Inc., claiming that we
owed the sum of approximately $570 to Inacom as a result of
Inacoms termination of a Vendor Purchase Agreement between
Inacom and us. The lawsuit was settled effective June6,
2006 for $100. The excess accrual of $469 was credited to income
from discontinued operations in the statement of operations for
the year ended December31, 2006.   On December22, 2005, CenterPoint Energy Service Company
filed a lawsuit in the District Court of Harris County, Texas

Transportation, Inc. and Cisco Systems, Inc. claiming
damages to product during shipment estimated to be $488 plus
consequential damages, legal fees, court costs, and interest.
The lawsuit is currently set for trial on April9, 2007.
The Company cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuit and, as a
result, cannot be assured that this case will not have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. Due to the uncertainty

STATEMENTSContinued   surrounding the issues involved in this matter and based on the
facts and circumstances known to date, the Company believes that
an estimate of loss, if any, that may be incurred cannot be made
at this time.   INX is also party to other litigation and claims which
management believes are normal in the course of its operations.
While the results of such litigation and claims cannot be
predicted with certainty, INX believes the final outcome of such
matters will not have a materially adverse effect on its results
of operations or financial position.   Leases Rent expense for the years ended
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled approximately
$1,111, $1,101, and $787, respectively. Future minimum rental
commitments on noncancellable operating leases with remaining
terms in excess of one year amount to approximately $897 in
2007, $906 in 2008, $875 in 2009, $521 in 2010, $314 in 2011,
and $498 thereafter.   Obligation under Software License Agreement
base payments of $469 in 2007 and $306 in 2008 are required
under a three year software license agreement expiring
December14, 2009. Supplemental fees may be payable under
the software license agreement based on actual network devices
utilizing the software. Supplemental fees will be expensed as
incurred.   401k Plan INX maintains a 401k savings
plan wherein it matches a portion of the employee contribution.
In addition, there is a discretionary matching fund based on the
net profitability of INX. All full-time employees who have
completed 90days of service with INX are eligible to
participate in the plan. Declaration of the discretionary
portion of the matching fund is the decision of the Board. INX
has made no additional contributions to the plan for the three
years ended December31, 2006. Under the standard plan
matching program, INXs expense was $86, $54 and $39 for
the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Subsequent
Event   On January19, 2007, the Company was notified that a
customer was terminating a NetSurant support services contract
effective February28, 2007. Services revenue recorded
under the NetSurant support service contract was $588, $108 and
$0 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Under the terms of the customers contract, a
termination payment is due to the Company that is in excess of
deferred costs associated with the contract. The company expects
to receive payment in early 2007 and any difference in the
amount received and the deferred costs will be recognized when
received.

Controls
and Procedures   Under the supervision and with the participation of certain
members of our management, including our Chairman of the Board,
Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, we
completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in
Rules13a-15e
and
15d-15e to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, we and our
management have concluded that, our disclosure controls and
procedures at December31, 2006 were effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in these
reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. During the fourth quarter of 2006, there has been
no change in our internal control over financial reporting that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.   We will consider further actions and continue to evaluate the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal controls
and procedures on an ongoing basis, taking corrective action as
appropriate. Management does not expect that disclosure controls
and procedures or internal controls can prevent all errors and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. While management believes
that its disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that fraud can be detected and prevented, because of
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.   The certifications of INXs Principal Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer attached as Exhibits311 and
312 to this Annual Report on
Form10-K
include, in paragraph4 of such certifications, information
concerning INXs disclosure controls and procedures and
internal controls over financial reporting. Such certifications
should be read in conjunction with the information contained in
this Item9A for a more complete understanding of the
matters covered by such certifications.
