Notes to the Consolidated Financial  49                    43 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To PCTEL, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PCTEL, Inc. a
Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These
financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of PCTEL, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in Item 14a2 is
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of
the basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states
in all material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.                        Arthur Andersen LLP San Jose, California

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1999
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization and Operations of the Company
PCTEL was originally incorporated in California in February 1994. In July
1998, the Company reincorporated in Delaware and this reincorporation has been
reflected retroactively in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
We are a leading provider of software based high speed connectivity solutions
to individuals and businesses worldwide. We design, develop, produce and market
advanced software-based high performance, low cost modems that are flexible and
upgradable, with functionality that can include data/fax transmission at
various speeds, and telephony features. Our host signal processing software
architecture utilizes the host PC central processing unit to perform digital
signal processing and other operations typically handled by dedicated hardware
found in conventional hardware-based modems. Our host signal processing
technology allows the elimination of this dedicated hardware, lowering costs
and enhancing capabilities.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Consolidation and Foreign Currency Translation
PCTEL uses the United States dollar for all its financial statements, even
for our subsidiaries in foreign countries. In formal terms we refer to this use
of the US dollar as the functional currency, and accordingly, all gains and
losses resulting from transactions originally in foreign currencies and then
translated into US dollars are included in net income. As of December 31, 1999,
PCTEL had subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands and Japan. These consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of PCTEL and our subsidiaries after
eliminating intercompany accounts and transactions.
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
We divide our financial instruments into two different classifications  Cash equivalents:  are debt instruments that mature within three months
after we purchase them.
Short-term     are marketable debt instruments that generally mature
investments:    between three months and two years from the date we
purchase them. All of our short-term investments are
classified as current assets and available-for-sale
because they are marketable and we have the option to
sell them before they mature.
As of December 31, 1999, short-term investments
consisted of high-grade corporate securities with
maturity dates of approximately five months to two
years.
These investments are recorded at market price and any
unrealized holding gains and losses based on the
difference between market price and book value
are reflected as other comprehensive income/loss in the
stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet. We
recorded a $66,000 unrealized holding loss in
49                  PCTEL, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
1999. Realized gains and losses and declines in value
of securities judged to be other than temporary are
included in interest income and have not been
significant to date. Interest and dividends of all
securities are included in interest income.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
We have potential credit risk primarily in two areas, our short-term
investments and trade receivables.
Our investment policy is to preserve the value of our capital and generate
interest income from these investments without undue exposure to risk. Market
risk is the potential loss due to the change in value of a financial instrument
due to interest rates or equity prices. The Company tries to moderate this risk
in two ways. First, the Company investment portfolio is divided between Banc
of America Securities and Salomon Smith Barney. By using two independent
investment banking firms the Company believes it has improved market
visibility. Secondly, the Company independently reviews market pricing on a
periodic basis based upon directly managing a limited amount of funds it uses
for operations which are not managed by its funds' managers.
For trade receivables, credit risk is the potential for a loss due to a
customer not meeting its payment obligations. We have established an allowance
for amounts which we may not be able to collect based on industry standards and
actual payment history. We moderate this risk by establishing and reviewing
credit limits, monitoring those limits and making updates as required. See note
10 for industry segment, customer and geographic information.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material,
labor and overhead costs. Inventories for 1999 and 1998 were composed of
finished goods only. Based on our current estimated requirements, it was
determined that there was excess inventory and those excess amounts were fully
reserved as of December 31, 1999 and 1998. Due to competitive pressures and
technological innovation, it is possible that these estimates could change in
the near term.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives three to seven years of
the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the corresponding lease
term.
Property and equipment consists of the following in thousands                                 December 31,

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Software Development Costs
We account for software development costs in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Our products
include a software component. To date, we have expensed all software
development costs because these costs were incurred prior to the products
reaching technological feasibility.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues consist primarily of sales of products to original equipment
manufacturers OEMs and distributors. Revenues from sales to OEMs are
recognized upon shipment. We provide for estimated sales returns and allowances
related to sales to OEMs at the time of shipment. Revenues from sales to
distributors are made under agreements allowing price protection and rights of
return on unsold products. In the fourth quarter of 1998, we began to record
revenue relating to sales to distributors only when the distributors have sold
the product to the end user. Prior to this change, PCTEL recognized revenues
upon shipment to distributors net of reserves for estimated returns and price
protection arrangements. While our previous method of accounting was in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we believe that the
new method is preferable. In the opinion of management, the new revenue
recognition method better reflects the economics of the transaction and
provides a better measure of operating results. In accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No. 20, Accounting Changes, the cumulative
effect of changing our revenue recognition policies related to sales to
distributors was not material to our financial statements.
We also generate revenues from engineering contracts. Revenues from
engineering contracts are recognized as contract milestones are achieved.
Royalty revenue is recognized when confirmation of royalties due to PCTEL is
received from licensees.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based awards to employees in accordance with APB No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We have adopted the disclosure-
only alternative of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Under APB No. 25, if the exercise price of our employee stock options equals or
exceeds the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense is recognized. However, if the stock option price is less
than fair market value a stock based compensation charge is required. We
recorded a deferred compensation charge for options granted below fair market
value before our Initial Public Offering IPO and have also included the pro
forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123 in Note 7.
Earnings Per Share
We compute earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share. SFAS No. 128 requires companies to compute net income per share under
two different methods, basic and diluted, and present per share data for all
periods in which a statement of operations is presented. Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common stock and common
stock equivalents outstanding. Common stock equivalents consist of preferred
stock using the if converted method and stock options and warrants using the
treasury stock method. Preferred stock, common stock options and warrants are
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share if their effect is
anti-dilutive.
Based on SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98, preferred and common stock
issued or granted for below fair market value nominal consideration prior to
the IPO must be included in the earnings per share calculation as if they had
been outstanding the entire period. We have never issued or granted this type
of stock.

Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years. We
assess the need to record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
operations when indicators of impairment are present. On an on-going basis, we
review the value and period of amortization or depreciation of long-lived
assets, including costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired. During
this review, the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost
of long-lived assets are reevaluated. Although the assumptions may vary from
transaction to transaction, they generally include revenue growth, operating
results, cash flows and other indicators of value. We then determine whether
there has been a permanent impairment of the value of long-lived assets by
comparing future estimated undiscounted cash flows to the asset carrying
value. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value
of the asset, a loss is recorded as the excess of the asset carrying value
over fair value. To date, we have not needed to record any impairment losses on
long-lived assets.
Comprehensive Income
Effective January 1, 1998, we adopted SFAS No. 130 Reporting Comprehensive
Income. Comprehensive income is to include amounts that have been previously
excluded from net income and reflected instead in stockholders' equity. For the
year ended December 31, 1999, comprehensive income is $54 million which
includes an unrealized holding loss of $66,000 related to available-for-sale
investments. For the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, comprehensive
income is the same as reported net income.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
Statement of Position SOP No. 98-1 Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal use, which we adopted in fiscal
1999. SOP No. 98-1 requires entities to capitalize certain costs related to
internal-use software once certain criteria has been met. The adoption did not
have a material impact on PCTEL financial position or results of operations.
52                  PCTEL, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
SOP No. 98-5 Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities, which we adopted
in 1999. It requires that all start-up costs related to new operations must be
expensed as incurred. In addition, all start-up costs that we previously
capitalized must be written off when SOP No. 98-5 is adopted. The adoption did
not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires
certain accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments
and hedging activities. It applies for the first quarter beginning January 1,
2001. Because we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and do not
engage in hedging activities, we do not believe that the adoption of SFAS No.
133, as amended, will have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition. SAB 101 summarizes
certain areas of the Staff views in applying generally accepted accounting
principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. PCTEL believes that
its current revenue recognition policies comply with SAB 101.
Risks and Uncertainties
For the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, we purchased integrated
circuits from a limited number of vendors. If these vendors are unable to
provide integrated circuits in a timely manner and we are unable to find
alternative vendors, our business, operating results and financial condition
could be adversely affected.
The majority of PCTEL revenues are derived from a limited number of
products utilizing host signal processing technology. The market for these
products is characterized by frequent transitions in which products rapidly
incorporate new features and performance standards. A failure to develop
products with required feature sets or performance standards or a delay in
bringing a new product to market could adversely affect our operating results.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform with the
current year presentation.
2. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  We invest in high quality, short-term investments, which we classify as
available-for-sale. There were no significant differences between amortized
cost and estimated fair value at December 31, 1999 and 1998. The following
table presents the estimated fair value breakdown of investment securities by

3. ACQUISITIONS Communications Systems Division
On December 22, 1998, we acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain of the liabilities of Communications Systems Division CSD,
a division of General DataComm, Inc., for a total purchase price of
approximately $17 million. We borrowed $163 million Note 4 from a bank to
pay for the entity and recorded the transaction under the purchase method of
accounting. Under this method, if the purchase price exceeds the net tangible
assets acquired, the difference is recorded as excess purchase price. In this
circumstance, that amount was $168 million. We attributed $61 million of the
excess purchase price to in-process research and development, which we expensed
immediately and the balance of $107 was attributed to patents and intellectual
property $87 million, work force $13 million and goodwill $07 million.
We have classified this balance of $107 million as Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are
amortizing it over useful lives of five years on a weighted average basis. We
have included the results of CSD from the date of acquisition to December 31,
1999 in these financial statements.
Upon completion of the CSD acquisition, the Company immediately expensed
$61 million representing purchased in-process technology that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The $61
million expensed as in-process research and development represented 37% of the
purchase price and was attributed and supported by a discounted probable cash
flow analysis that identified revenue on a project by project basis. The
following three in-process projects existed at CSD as of the acquisition date:
HIDRA High Density Remote Access System, Industrial Modems, and xDSL Digital
Subscriber Line project. The value assigned to purchased in-process
technology, based on a percentage of completion discounted cash flow method,
was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which
technological feasibility has not been established.
Approximately $87 million, 53% of the purchase price, was attributed to
core technology and existing patented technology, related to the portfolio of
patents that address the v34 336 Kbs and v90 56 Kbs international modem
standards set by the International Telecommunications Union ITU. The
portfolio is comprised of over 36 patents and filings, including four v34
patents and two v90 patents, which are required by the ITU standard, and three
v90 patents considered very important in the manufacture of the v90 modem.
The value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased
in-process technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows
back to their present value. Approximately 69% of the in-process research and
development value was attributed to the HIDRA project, which is focused on
increasing the number of modems within the RAS Remote Access Server. This
technology will represent a migration of the single and dual DSP Digital
Signal Processing platforms to enable higher density modems for central site
applications. Specifically, CSD is working to create three modem ports on each
DSP through the use of software. The xDSL digital subscriber line, which
represents 28% of the in-process research and development value, will encompass
a variety of DSL systems covering speeds from 53 Mbps down to 128 Kbps. Similar
to the HIDRA concept, CSD was working on an xDSL product technology that will
allow more than one DSL modem per DSP chip, thus attempting to optimize
transmission speeds. Industrial Modems, which represents approximately 3% of
the in-process research and development value, is an offshoot of the HIDRA
project. Based on the same architectural foundation as the HIDRA, Industrial
Modems are targeted at the industrial market for use in transmitting updated
information to and from remote sites.
The discount rate includes a risk adjusted discount rate to take into
account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased
in-process technology. The risk-adjusted discount rate applied to
54                  PCTEL, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
the projects' cash flows was 18% for existing technology and 24% for the in-
process technology. Based upon assessment of each in-process project
development stage, including relative difficulty of remaining development
milestones, it was determined that application of a 24% discount rate was
appropriate for all three acquired in-process projects. The valuation includes
cash inflows from in-process technology through 2002 with revenues commencing
in 1999 and increasing significantly in 2000 before declining in 2002. A
royalty payment of 3% was assumed from in-process technology to existing
technology, based on management estimate of a patent license rate. The High
Density Remote Access System and industrial modem projects were approximately
56% complete at the time of the valuation and the expected timeframe for
achieving these product releases was assumed to be in the second half of 1999.
The DSL project was approximately 56% complete at the time of the valuation and
the expected time frame for achieving this product release is assumed to be in
2000. The percentage complete calculations for all projects were estimated
based on research and development expenses incurred to date and management
estimates of remaining development costs. Significant remaining development
efforts were to be completed in the next 6 to 18 months in order for CSD
projects to become implemented in a commercially viable timeframe. Management
cash flow and other assumptions utilized at the time of acquisition do not
materially differ from historical pricing/licensing, margin, and expense levels
of the CSD group prior to acquisition.
If these projects are not successfully developed, the Company future
revenue and profitability may be adversely affected. Additionally, the value of
other intangible assets acquired may become impaired.
The unaudited pro forma financial information for the years ended December
31, 1998 and 1997 is presented below in thousands except per share data as if
CSD had been acquired on January 1, 1997. Pro forma net income excludes the
write-off of acquired in-process research and development of $61 million.                                  Year Ended

of its wholly owned subsidiaries each entered into a note payable arrangement
the Notes with a bank. The two Notes were for a total of $163 million.
These Notes bore interest at the bank prime interest rate plus 05% and were
subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants and a prepayment
penalty during the first 3 years of their terms. We were required to provide
the bank with a primary security interest in all of our assets and we issued a
warrant to the bank to purchase 200,000 shares of Series C preferred stock at
$800 per share which was converted to a warrant to purchase common stock at
the time of the IPO. This warrant expires December 2008.
The warrant was immediately exercisable and expired ten years from the date
of issuance. The warrant fair value as of the date issued was approximately
$14 million using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We recorded that
amount as a deferred charge to be amortized over the term of the Notes.
On October 25, 1999, following the Company IPO, we used $155 million of
the offering proceeds to repay the Notes. The total payment of $155 million
included $150 million of principal, $74,000 of accrued
55                  PCTEL, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
interest and a $450,000 prepayment penalty. As a result of the early
extinguishment of debt, we recorded the unamortized portion of the deferred
charge relating to the issuance of the warrants discussed above and the
prepayment penalty as an extraordinary loss, net of taxes, which totaled
$16 million.

the Series A, B, and C convertible preferred stock were automatically converted
into 8,510,748 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 1999, our board of
directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock
in one or more series. The board of directors can fix the price, rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions of this preferred stock.
6. INCOME TAXES  We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance
with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred
taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates.

purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Our net deferred tax

Other cumulative temporary differences consist of items currently deductible
for financial reporting purposes, but not for tax purposes. These items are
primarily estimated reserves and accruals. The realization of the deferred tax
asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future years.
Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that
all of the deferred tax asset will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax
asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if
estimates of future taxable income during future years are reduced.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 7. COMMON STOCK Initial Public Offering
On October 19, 1999, PCTEL completed its IPO of common stock. A total of
5,290,000 shares were sold at a price of $1700 per share including the
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option of 690,000 shares. We
received net proceeds of approximately $825 million. Upon closing of the
offering, all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock were
automatically converted into 8,510,748 shares of common stock.
Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance
As of December 31, 1999, we had reserved shares of common stock for future

Stock Option Plans
We have two stock option plans, the 1995 Stock Option Plan 1995 Plan and
the 1997 Stock Option Plan 1997 Plan. Under both Plans, the Board of
Directors may grant to employees and consultants options and/or purchase rights
to purchase our common stock at terms and prices determined by the Board of
Directors. We have under the 1995 Plan 3,200,000 of authorized shares that we
can issue. As of December 31, 1999, of the total 3,200,000 shares authorized
for issuance, we have remaining 152,673 shares that we can grant under the 1995
Plan. We have under the 1997 Plan 5,500,000 of authorized shares that we can
issue. As of December 31, 1999, of the total 5,500,000 shares authorized for
issuance, we have remaining 1,343,572 shares that we can grant under the 1997
Plan.
In August 1999, the Board of Directors and our stockholders approved an
amendment and restatement of the 1997 Plan and approved an additional increase
in the number of authorized shares we can issue under the 1997 Plan to
5,500,000 shares of common stock. We will further increase annually the number
of authorized shares we can issue under the 1997 Plan by an amount equal to the
lesser of i 700,000 shares, ii 4% of the outstanding shares on such date or
iii a lesser amount determined by the Board of Directors. The exercise price
and vesting of all grants are to be determined by the Board of Directors. The
exercise price of incentive stock options cannot be less than the fair market
value of the common stock on the grant date. The Stock Plan Committee, a
committee within the Board of Directors, determined the fair market value of
our common stock prior to our IPO. In determining the fair market value of our
common stock, the Stock Plan Committee in each case took into consideration a
number of factors, including our operating results and financial condition at
the time of each stock option grant, key developments affecting our business
and, where relevant, the most recent price of our preferred stock in connection
with financing transactions with independent investors. Options granted under
the 1997 Plan expire 10 years from the date of grant. The 1997 Plan will
terminate in 2007.
Nonqualified options granted under the 1995 Plan and 1997 Plan must be
issued at a price equal to at least 85% of the fair market value of our common
stock at the date of grant. The options may be exercised at any time within ten
years of the date of grant or within ninety days of termination of employment,
or such shorter time as may be provided in the stock option agreement, and vest
over a vesting schedule determined by the Board of Directors.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 1998 Director Option Plan Directors Plan
Our Directors Plan became effective following our IPO in October 1999. We
have reserved a total of 200,000 shares of common stock that we can issue under
our Directors Plan. Under our 1998 Directors Plan any new non-employee director
elected to the Board of Directors automatically receives a grant of 15,000
shares of common stock. The 15,000 share options will vest one-third as of each
anniversary of its date of grant until the option is fully vested, provided
that the optionee continues to serve as a director on such dates. After the
initial 15,000 share option is granted to the non-employee director, he or she
shall automatically be granted an option to purchase 7,500 shares each year on
January 1, if on such date he or she shall have served on the Board of
Directors for at least six months. The 7,500 share options shall vest
completely on the anniversary of their date of grant, provided that the
optionee continues to serve as a director on such dates. All of the options
granted under our 1998 Directors Plan have a term of 10 years. The exercise
price of all options is 100% of the fair market value per share of the common
stock, generally determined with reference to the closing price of the common
stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on the date of grant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan
In May 1998, we reserved a total of 800,000 shares of common stock for
future issuance under our Purchase Plan, plus annual increases equal to the
lesser of i 350,000 shares ii 2% of the outstanding shares on such date or
iii a lesser amount determined by the Board of Directors. Our Purchase Plan
will enable eligible employees to purchase common stock at the lower of 85% of
the fair market value of our common stock on the first or last day of each six-
month offering period. The first offering period began on October 19, 1999
following the initial public offering. The Purchase Plan will terminate in
2008.
Deferred Compensation
In connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees during
the years ended December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, we recorded deferred
compensation of $54 million and $257,000, respectively, representing the
difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting
purposes and the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant.
Such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders' equity and is
amortized ratably over the four year vesting period of the applicable options.
The amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees in all
operating expense categories. However, the amortization of deferred
compensation has not been separately allocated to these categories. The amount
of deferred compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could
decrease if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been
recorded are forfeited.
Valuation of Stock Options
Under SFAS No. 123 we are required to present pro forma information
regarding net income and net income per share as if we had accounted for our
stock options under the fair value method. The fair value for the stock options
was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following assumptions for fiscal years 1999, 1998 and 1997: risk-free
interest rates in the range of 47% to 65%; dividend yields of zero; an
estimated volatility factor of the market price of the Company common stock
in the range of 40% to 75%; and an expected life between three to six months
after vest date. The weighted-average estimated fair value of options granted
during fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $688, $343 and $232 per share,
respectively.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility and
expected
59                  PCTEL, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
option life. Because our employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in
the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate,
in our opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the option vesting periods. Our pro forma
net income loss would have been approximately $16 million, $984,000 and
$20 million for fiscal years 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Pro forma
diluted net income loss per share would have been $011, $042 and $017
for fiscal years 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The following table

Warrants
In February 1998, in connection with the issuance of Series C preferred
stock, we issued warrants to purchase 2,417 shares of common stock at $800 per
share. In 1999, a portion of these warrants were exercised to purchase 1,354
shares of common stock. The remaining warrants expire in February 2001 and the
fair value

at the date of issuance was not material. In December 1998, in connection with
the notes payable referred to in note 4, we issued a warrant to purchase
200,000 shares of Series C preferred stock at $800 per share which was
converted to a warrant to purchase common stock at the time of the IPO. This
warrant expires December 2008. As of December 31, 1999, this warrant had not
been exercised.
8. LEASE ARRANGEMENTS  We entered into an operating lease for our new facilities in Milpitas,
California in September 1999. The lease expires in February 2003. Additionally,
we have facilities in Waterbury, Connecticut, Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
We have non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities through 2003
and operating leases for equipment through 2004. Our future minimum rental
commitments under these leases at December 31, 1999, are as follows in
thousands

Future minimum lease  $3,448
Our rent expense under operating leases for the years ended December 31,
1999, 1998 and 1997 was approximately $985,000, $364,000 and $248,000,
respectively.
9. CONTINGENCIES  As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, we accrued royalties of approximately $79
million and $51 million, respectively. We entered into royalty agreements in
fiscal 1999 and 1998 and continue to negotiate royalty agreements with several
other third parties. Accordingly, we have accrued our best estimate of the
amount of royalties payable based on royalty agreements already signed or in
negotiation, as well as advice from patent counsel. Should the final agreements
result in royalty rates significantly different from these assumptions, our
business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected. During 1998, we reversed $30 million of accrued royalties.
Upon consummation of the Communications Systems Division acquisition in
December 1998, we reduced our royalty reserves because we believe that in some
instances we can obtain necessary licenses of third party technologies in
exchange for grants of cross licenses of our patent portfolio rather than the
payment of license fees or royalties.
During 1998, Motorola, Inc. Motorola filed an action for patent
infringement against us and one other defendant of seven Motorola patents. In
its complaint, Motorola was seeking damages for our alleged infringement,
including treble damages for our alleged willful infringement and an injunction
against us. Motorola was also seeking attorney fees and costs.
We filed an answer to Motorola complaint denying infringement of the seven
asserted Motorola patents and asserted that each patent is invalid or
unenforceable. In addition, we asserted counterclaims and declaratory relief
for invalidity and/or unenforceability and noninfringements of each of the
seven asserted Motorola patents. By our counterclaims, we were seeking
compensatory and punitive damages, an injunction against Motorola, and an award
of treble damages for Motorola violation of the Federal and state antitrust
laws, and for violation

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
of Massachusetts General Law. We were also seeking our costs and attorney
fees in this action. In September 1999, we reached a settlement with Motorola
as to all claims raised by both parties. The settlement requires us to make
royalty payments to Motorola based on unit volume. As part of the settlement,
we granted a cross-license to Motorola to utilize portions of our technology
and Motorola granted us a cross-license to utilize portions of their
technology. This settlement did not have a material effect on our financial
position or operating results.
On April 9, 1999, ESS Technology Inc. filed a complaint against us in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that we
failed to grant licenses for some of our International Telecommunications
Union-related patents to ESS on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
ESS complaint includes claims based on antitrust law, patent misuse, breach
of contract and unfair competition. In its complaint, ESS also seeks a
declaration that some of our International Telecommunications Union-related
patents are unenforceable and that we should be ordered by the court to grant a
license to ESS on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
We filed an answer to ESS complaint by moving to dismiss on the basis that
ESS had not alleged facts sufficient to state a legal claim. ESS responded by
amending its complaint to include additional factual and legal allegations and
filing an opposition to the motion to dismiss. On August 2, 1999, the Court
denied our motion to dismiss as moot in view of ESS amended complaint.
On August 12, 1999, we filed a motion to dismiss ESS amended complaint. On
November 4, 1999, the United States District Court in San Jose granted a
dismissal of the antitrust and state unfair competition claims, ruling that ESS
had failed to allege injury to competition in the market for modems. The Court
allowed the specific performance of contract claim to stand, ruling that the
license terms granted to other market participants would provide a sufficient
basis for defining contractual terms that could be applied to ESS. The Court
also denied the Motion with respect to dismissal of the declaratory relief
claims, holding that they were sufficiently ripe for adjudication. The Court
granted ESS leave to again amend its complaint, which it did on November 24,
1999, by filing a second amended complaint. On January 14, 2000, we filed a
motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. ESS filed its opposition to the
motion on January 21, 2000 and we filed our reply on January 28, 2000. On
February 11, 2000, the Court heard oral argument on our motion to dismiss the
second amended complaint. On February 14, 2000, the Court dismissed ESS
complaint and gave ESS twenty days to amend its complaint. In particular, the
Court stated that ESS must allege the relevant geographic market and product
market in the complaint. In response to the Court February 14, 2000 order,
ESS filed its third amended complaint on March 6, 2000.
Due to the nature of litigation generally and because the lawsuit brought by
ESS is still in the pleading stage, we cannot ascertain the outcome of the
final resolution of the lawsuit, the availability of injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies, or estimate the total expenses, possible damages or
settlement value, if any, that we may ultimately incur in connection with ESS
suit. This litigation could be time consuming and costly, and we will not
necessarily prevail given the inherent uncertainties of litigation. However, we
believe that we have valid defenses to this litigation, including the fact that
other companies license these International Telecommunications Union-related
patents from us on the same terms that are being challenged by ESS. We believe
that it is unlikely this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our
financial position or results of operations. We are vigorously contesting, and
intend to continue to vigorously contest, all of ESS claims.
PCTEL is subject to various claims which arise in the normal course of
business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these
claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position, liquidity or results of operations.
10. INDUSTRY SEGMENT, CUSTOMER AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION  We are organized based upon the nature of the products we offer. Under this
organizational structure, we operate in one segment, that segment being
