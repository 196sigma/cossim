We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial

page 19 of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ThrustMaster,
Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 1996 and 1997 and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the
information required to be included therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts
NOTE 1--THE COMPANY
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ThrustMaster,
Inc., the Company, an Oregon corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
ThrustMaster Foreign Sales Corporation. The Company was incorporated on July 31,
1990. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a variety of game
controllers, primarily for personal computers, and related equipment.
NOTE 2--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.
INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a
first-in, first-out basis. Finished goods are costed using standard cost, which
approximates the first-in, first-out method of accounting.
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Plant and equipment are stated at cost and are 
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives 
three to seven years. Replacements and improvements which extend the useful 
life are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs and routine replacements are 
expensed as incurred. Upon disposal, costs and related accumulated 
depreciation of the assets are removed from the accounts and resulting gains 
and losses are reflected in operations.
INCOME TAXES. From January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1994, the 
Company was treated for federal income tax purposes as an S corporation under 
Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and was 
treated as an S corporation for state income tax purposes under comparable 
state tax laws. As a result, the Company earnings from January 1, 1991 
through December 31, 1994 have been, for federal and certain state income tax 
purposes, taxed directly to the Company shareholders, rather than to the 
Company. Effective January 1, 1995 the Termination Date, the Company S 
corporation status was terminated. Subsequent to the Termination Date, the 
Company is no longer treated as an S corporation and, accordingly, is subject 
to federal and state income taxes on its earnings.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax 
consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting and 
tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit 
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted 
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those 
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on 
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in 
income in the period of change. Valuation allowances are established when 
necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be 
realized.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revenue is recognized at the time of product 
shipment. All products have a warranty for one year from date of sale 
covering product defects. Certain sales agreements provide 
25 NOTE 2--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
the right to return on unsold merchandise. The Company provides for estimated 
costs of warranty and returns when products are shipped. The Company offers 
price protection to certain customers on its products. The Company records 
anticipated price protection as a reduction of sales.
RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING EXPENSE. Research and engineering costs are
charged to operations as incurred.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The Company maintains a sales and 
distribution office and warehouse in Surrey, England, through which all of 
its European sales are made. The financial statements of the Company 
operations in the United Kingdom have been translated into U.S. dollars in 
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52, 
Foreign Currency Translation. Certain of the Company sales to foreign 
distributors are denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses 
associated with the foreign currency transaction gains and losses are 
recorded in the Company financial statements at the settlement date. Gains 
and losses associated with foreign currency receivables are recorded based 
upon the exchange rate at the end of the period.
EARNINGS PER SHARE DATA. In February 1997, the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, 
Earnings per Share SFAS 128. This Statement supersedes APB Opinion No. 
15 and specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements 
for earnings per share for entities with publicly held common stock or 
potential common stock. The Company was required to adopt the provisions of 
SFAS No. 128 for the year ended December 31, 1997. As it relates to the 
Company, the principal differences between the provisions of SFAS 128 and 
previous authoritative pronouncements are exclusion of common stock 
equivalents in the determination of Basic Earnings Per Share and the market 
price at which common stock equivalents are calculated in the determination 
of Diluted Earnings per Share.
Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average 
number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings 
per common share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of 
common stock and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the 
year. Common equivalent shares from stock options are excluded from the 
computation when their effect is antidilutive.
Stock Dividend On January 21, 1997, the Company board of directors 
declared a 3% stock dividend payable to shareholders of record on February 
14, 1997. Share, per share, common stock, stock option and warrant amounts 
have been restated to reflect the effect of this stock dividend.
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. During 1997, the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 130 and SFAS No. 131, 
Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. These 
standards will become effective for the Company 1998 fiscal year. SFAS No. 
130 establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income 
and 
26 NOTE 2--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. SFAS 
No. 131 changes current practice by establishing a new framework on which to 
base segment reporting referred to as the management approach and also 
requires interim reporting of segment information. Management is currently 
assessing the impact of the implementation of these standards on the 
consolidated financial statements of the Company.
NOTE 3--CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND MAJOR
CUSTOMER INFORMATION
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to 
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash 
equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company cash equivalents are in 
high quality securities placed with institutions with high credit ratings.
The Company accounts receivable are primarily from a small number of 
computer wholesale distributors and software specialty stores located in the 
United States, Canada, and western Europe. Management believes that any risk 
of loss is significantly reduced by its ongoing credit evaluations of its 
customers' financial condition.
In 1995 product sales to two customers each accounted for approximately 10%
of revenues. In 1996, no customer individually accounted for more than 10% of
revenues. During 1997, two customers accounted for 118% and 104% of revenues,
respectively.
The Company operates in a single industry segment comprising interactive 
control devices for use with personal computer entertainment software. 
Certain of the Company products are manufactured and assembled in Taiwan 
and China by an independent contractor. Products manufactured and assembled 
by this vendor approximated 376% and 743%, and 899% of total products in 
1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively.
Net revenue by geographic region and as a percentage of total revenue for 
each region outside the United States that constituted more than 10% of the 
Company total revenue is as follows                                            YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

NOTE 6--BANK LINE OF CREDIT
At December 31, 1997, the Company had a revolving line of credit with a bank
which provided for borrowings up to the lesser of one million dollars or 75% of
eligible receivables. Borrowings are payable on demand and bear interest at a
fluctuating rate equal to the prime rate or a rate based on LIBOR 85% at
December 31, 1997. The Company bank temporarily increased the line of credit
to the lesser of $50 million or 60% of eligible receivables through January 31,
1998 to meet the Company seasonal working capital needs during the fourth
quarter of 1997. The Company also may borrow up to two hundred thousand dollars
to finance up to 80% of the cost of certain equipment. Borrowings under the
agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the Company assets. Loan
covenants under the agreement include maintaining a defined level of working
capital and maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio. At December 31, 1997 1,110 was outstanding under the line.
28 NOTE 7--ACCRUED LIABILITIES
Accrued liabilities consist of the following                                                   DECEMBER 31,

determined based upon the Company revenues and net income for the year. The
Company recorded expense of $118 in 1995, $251 in 1996, and $289 in 1997,
related to such amounts.
NOTE 8--COMMITMENTS
The Company leases facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating
leases. Certain of the facility leases contain escalation clauses. The following
is a schedule by years, through expiration of the leases, of future minimum
lease payments required under these leases as of December 31, 1997:
1998.$660
1999. 705

distribution facilities, the Company is obligated to the lessors for its share
of certain expenses related to the use, operation, maintenance and insurance of
the property. These expenses, payable monthly in addition to the base rent, are
not included in the amounts shown above. Rental expense totaled $239, $236 and
$438 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively.
NOTE 9--STOCK OPTION PLANS AND WARRANTS
The Company has adopted a stock option plan for employees the 1994 Stock
Option Plan and a separate option plan for directors the Directors' Stock
Option Plan. The Company has reserved 400,000 shares for issuance under the
1994 Stock Option Plan and 160,000 shares for issuance under the Director
Stock Option Plan. The 1994 Stock Option Plan provides for incentive stock
option and nonqualified options to be granted. The Company previously made
grants under a nonqualified plan adopted in 1990 in which 1,200,000 shares had
been reserved. In July 1994, any ungranted
29 NOTE 9--STOCK OPTION PLANS AND WARRANTS CONTINUED
options and any future forfeitures under the 1990 option plan were 
transferred to the 1994 Stock Option Plan.
The stock option plans generally require the price of options to be at 
the estimated fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options 
have a maximum duration of ten years five years under certain circumstances 
and may be exercised in varying amounts over the vesting periods.

During 1995, warrants to purchase 139,050 shares were granted at a price of
$757 per share after giving effect to the stock dividend discussed in Note 2.
There were 117,151 warrants outstanding at December 31, 1997.
The Company applies APB opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. However, in accordance with SFAS 123, pro forma
disclosures as if the Company adopted the cost recognition requirements under
SFAS 123 for all awards subsequent to January 1, 1995, are presented below.
