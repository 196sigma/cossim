REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of MapInfo Corporation and Subsidiaries
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14a present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of MapInfo Corporation and its subsidiaries at
September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1998,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
under Item 14a presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

MAPINFO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except share data
1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
MapInfo designs, develops, markets, licenses and supports business mapping
software products, application development tools, and data products, together
with a range of consulting, training and technical support services. These
products are sold through multiple distribution channels, including an
indirect channel of value-added resellers and distributors, a corporate
account sales force, and a telemarketing sales group. The Company products
are translated into 20 languages and sold in 58 countries throughout the
world. MapInfo markets its products worldwide through sales offices in North
America, Europe and Australia, and throughout the rest of Europe and the Asia-
Pacific region through exclusive and non-exclusive distribution relationships.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MapInfo
Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For the purpose of the cash flows statements, the Company defines cash and
cash equivalents as cash and investments with original maturities of three
months or less.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined on the
average cost method and consist primarily of computer media, user manuals and
software packaging supplies.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company short-term investments consist of debt securities with maturity
dates of one year or less. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, debt securities
have been classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as held-
to-maturity securities and are reported at amortized cost because the Company
has the positive intent and the ability to hold these debt securities to
maturity. Market value is determined by quoted market prices.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets two to ten
years for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax
purposes. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the
applicable costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and the resulting gain or loss is recognized.

1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Product development costs, including product enhancements, are capitalized
after technological feasibility has been established. These costs are reported
at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over two to five years, the estimated
economic life of the products. Annual amortization under the straight-line
method is greater than the ratio of current gross revenue to total expected
product revenues method. Amortization expense is classified as research and
development expense in the accompanying consolidated income statements.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the fair value of net
assets acquired. Intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line
method over five to seven years. The Company continually evaluates the
existence of impairment on the basis of whether the intangible asset is fully
recoverable from projected, undiscounted net cash flows of the related
business activity.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company revenue recognition policies are in compliance with American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 91-1, Software
Revenue Recognition.
Product revenue: Revenue from software license and technology development fees
is recognized upon the later of shipment of product or completion of
significant obligations to customers, provided collectibility of the resulting
receivable is probable.
Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM Revenue: Revenue from products licensed
to original equipment manufacturers is recorded when the product has been
shipped and all obligations of the Company have been satisfied, provided
collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable.
Value Added Reseller VAR Sales: Revenue from product sales to distributors
and VAR is recorded when related products are shipped, provided
collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable.
Postcontract customer support PCS: PCS, inclusive of technical support and
maintenance, may be bundled with an initial licensing fee or sold separately.
In either case, the fair market value of the PCS arrangement is recognized
ratably over the term of the agreement, generally over a one to two year
period, provided collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable.
Services revenue: Revenue from services such as training and consulting are
recognized as the services are performed, provided collectibility of the
resulting receivable is probable.
RESERVE FOR RETURNS
The Company as a matter of policy provides the buyer the right to return
certain products within a stated period ranging from 30-60 days, for a refund
of the purchase price or replacement of the product. Accordingly, the Company
accrues for estimated future returns.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary
differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable for future
years to differences between financial statement and tax basis of existing
assets and liabilities. The effect of tax rate changes on deferred taxes is
recognized in the income tax provision in the period that includes the
enactment date.

1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Business tax credits are recorded by the flow-through method of accounting,
whereby they are applied as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the
credits are utilized.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are
translated at year-end exchange rates, and the income statements are
translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains
or losses resulting from translating non-U.S. currency financial statements
are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and
losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income. The
Company exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated, in part, by the fact
that it incurs certain operating costs in the same foreign currencies in which
revenues are denominated.
COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 Earnings Per Share, earnings per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common and diluted common equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted common equivalent shares consist of stock options
using the treasury stock method.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1996 and 1997 amounts to
conform with the 1998 presentation.

custody of $23,666 of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
under an investment management agreement. The Company paid investment
management fees to this firm of $30, $36 and $42 in 1996, 1997 and 1998,

received a warrant to acquire additional shares over a period of 5 years at a
total cost of $550 thousand and options from existing stockholders to acquire
a majority interest in Object/FX Corporation at any time during the period
commencing October 3, 2000 and ending April 3, 2001, for a purchase price

OPERATING LEASES:
The Company leases two facilities in the Rensselaer Technology Park totaling
approximately 102,000 square feet of office space. These offices house the
corporate headquarters, the principal research and development center and the
principal sales, marketing and administrative staff for the Americas. These
leases contain a nominal escalation in rental payments over the term of the

for such costs as real estate taxes and maintenance. The Company may acquire
these facilities through the termination of these leases at a negotiated
purchase price. The leases expire in 2002 and 2004. The Company also leases
office space of approximately 11,000 square feet in Windsor, England, which
houses the European headquarters. The lease on this facility expires in 2012.
Future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have
initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of
September 30, 1998 decline from $20 million in 1999 to $12 million in 2003.
Total rent expense for the years ended September 30, 1996, 1997 and 1998 was
approximately $1,665, $2,133 and $2,253, respectively.
YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE:
The Company saleable products rely on software applications. The Company
expects that some of its customers may be using older product versions that

experience increased expenses in addressing migration issues for such
customers.

U.S. income loss before taxes was $684, $826 and $3,114 for the years
ended September 30, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
Deferred income taxes recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at September
30, 1997 and 1998 consist of the following temporary differences:
1997  1998
Current deferred tax asset:
Accrued expenses              $ 347 $ 306
Bad debt reserve                67   217

Net long term deferred tax asset      1,146  1,369
Net deferred tax asset          $1,815 $2,103
There are no valuation allowances recorded against the Company deferred tax
assets, as it is more likely than not that all future tax benefits will be
realized against future taxable income. However, the amount of deferred tax
assets, considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates
of future taxable income are reduced.
