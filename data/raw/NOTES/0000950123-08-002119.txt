Henry Schein, Inc.
Melville, New York We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of
December29, 2007 and December30, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December29,
2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Henry Schein, Inc. at December29, 2007 and December
30, 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December29, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, Henry Schein, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as
of December29, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOand our
report dated February25, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ BDO SEIDMAN, LLP New York, New York

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations We distribute healthcare products and services primarily to office-based healthcare
practitioners in the combined North American and European markets, with operations in the United
States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We
also have affiliates in Iceland, Israel and the United Arab Emirates. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry Schein, Inc. and all of
our wholly-owned and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are
greater than or equal to 20% and less than or equal to 50% owned, are accounted for under the
equity method. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fiscal Year We report our operations and cash flows on a 52-53week basis ending on the last Saturday of
December. The years ended December29, 2007 and December30, 2006 consisted of 52weeks and the
year ended December31, 2005 consisted of 53weeks. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the sale of dental, medical and animal health consumable products, as
well as equipment, software products and services and other sources. Provisions for discounts,
rebates to customers, customer returns and other contra-revenue adjustments are recorded based upon
historical data and estimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are
recognized. Revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped
to customers. Such sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped using third-party
common carriers. We believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time
indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post-shipment obligations, the
product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and
product returns are reasonably estimable. 53 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued Revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to
customers. Such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by
equipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal installation, which is
completed at the time of delivery. Revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to
customers. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive
training due to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer support for
software, including annual support and/or training, is recognized over the period in which the
services are provided. Revenue derived from other sources including freight charges, equipment repairs and financial
services, is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are
provided. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly-liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Outstanding checks in excess of
funds on deposit of $446million and $484million, primarily related to payments for inventory,
were classified as accounts payable as of December29, 2007 and December30, 2006. Available-for-sale Securities At December29, 2007, our available-for-sale securities consist of an investment in stock of a
single company. At December30, 2006, our available-for-sale securities consist of highly liquid
tax-efficient securities, including primarily auction-rate securities and variable-rate demand
notes which had a high degree of liquidity and were reflected at fair value. We determine cost of investments in available-for-sale securities on a specific identification
basis. Gross realized gains and losses were immaterial in all periods presented. Accounts Receivable and Reserves The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects
our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. The reserve for accounts receivable
is comprised of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns. In addition to reviewing
delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many factors in estimating our reserve, including
historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness and economic trends. From time to
time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors
expected to affect collectibility. 54 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued Inventories and Reserves Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined primarily by the first-in, first-out method. In performing our lower of cost
or market valuation, we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the
inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends. From time to time,
we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to
affect the value of inventory. Direct Shipping and Handling Costs Freight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales. Direct handling costs,
which represent primarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise
prepare, if necessary, merchandise for shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general
and administrative expenses. These costs from continuing operations were $487million, $430
million and $380million for 2007, 2006 and 2005. Advertising and Promotional Costs We generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred. Total advertising and
promotional expenses from continuing operations were $196million, $189million and $200million
for 2007, 2006 and 2005. Additionally, advertising and promotional costs incurred in connection
with direct marketing, including product catalogs and printed material, are deferred and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the period which is benefited, generally not exceeding one year. As
of December29, 2007 and December30, 2006, we had $48million and $43million of deferred direct
marketing expenses included in other current assets. Supplier Rebates Supplier rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are
earned. The factors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted
inventory purchases and sales, in conjunction with supplier rebate contract terms, which generally
provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume. 55 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization.
Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser
of the useful life of the assets or the lease term. Depreciation is computed primarily under the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives   
Years   Buildings and permanent improvements

Machinery and warehouse equipment

Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop software. Costs incurred
during the application development stage for software bought and further customized by outside
suppliers for our use and software developed by a supplier for our proprietary use are capitalized.
Costs incurred for our own personnel who are directly associated with software development may
also be capitalized. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the
recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating
future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than enactments of
changes in tax laws or rates. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates will be recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment
date. We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S.
subsidiaries. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are determined
using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are
translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions are included in earnings. Risk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective is to manage the impact that interest rate and
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have on recognized asset and liability fair
values, earnings and cash flows. Our risk management policy requires that derivative contracts
used as hedges be effective at reducing the risks associated with the exposure being hedged and be
designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract. We do not enter into derivative
instruments for speculative purposes. Our
derivative instruments include interest rate swap agreements related to our long-term fixed
rate debt and foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loans and
certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with foreign suppliers. 56 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued Our interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges. The terms of our
interest rate swap agreements are identical to the senior notes and consequently qualify for an
assumption of no ineffectiveness under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards FAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Both
the interest rate swap agreements and the underlying senior notes are marked-to-market through
earnings at the end of each period; however, since our interest rate swap agreements are deemed
fully effective, these mark-to-market adjustments have no net impact on earnings. Our foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loans are designated
as either fair value hedges loans expected to be repaid within the foreseeable future or net
investment hedges loans not expected to be repaid within the foreseeable future and our foreign
currency forward and swap agreements related to intercompany loan interest payments are designated
as cash flow hedges. Our foreign currency forward and swap agreements related to forecasted
inventory purchase commitments are designated as cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the
derivative, along with the transaction gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded in earnings.
For net investment hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the
derivative, along with any gain or loss on the hedged item, is recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For cash flow hedges, the
effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative, along with any gain or loss
on the hedged item, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the
hedged transaction affects earnings. During the year ended December30, 2006, we implemented a change in our method of assessing
the amount of effectiveness on all newly transacted net investment hedges to be based on changes in
spot exchange rates. Previously, we assessed the amount of effectiveness using a method based on
changes in forward exchange rates. This change in method essentially converts certain U.S. LIBOR
based borrowings to Euro LIBOR based borrowings allowing us to better align our interest costs and
the currency-denomination of funding the business with the geography of our business interests. With regard to all net investment hedging arrangements which existed at the date of this
change, we stopped applying hedge accounting prospectively from the date of change. As a result,
we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $20million, representing the foreign exchange
component of our mark-to-market adjustment for the period from the date of change through December
30, 2006. We classify the cash flows related to our hedging activities in the same category on our
consolidated statements of cash flows as the cash flows related to the hedged item. 57 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued Acquisitions The net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition
date and our consolidated financial statements include their results of operations from that date.
Any excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. Certain acquisitions provide for contingent consideration, primarily cash, to be paid
in the event certain financial performance targets are satisfied over future periods. We have not
accrued any liabilities that may arise from these transactions because the outcome of the
contingencies is not determinable beyond a reasonable doubt. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to
annual impairment analyses. Such impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the fair
value to the carrying value of reporting units. Measuring fair value of a reporting unit is
generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings, unless supportable
information is available for using a present value technique, such as estimates of future cash
flows. We regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental, medical including
animal health, international and technology. Goodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for
the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis. We
assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually
and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Some factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include   
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future
operating results   
significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our
overall business e.g. decision to divest a business; or   
significant negative industry or economic trends. If we determine through the impairment review process that indefinite-lived intangible assets
are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets.
Definite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade
names, customer lists, customer relationships and intellectual property. When an impairment
exists, the related assets are written down to fair value. 58 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

discounts, supplier chargebacks and rebates and inbound and outbound freight charges. Costs
related to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing, internal inventory transfers and other
costs of our distribution network are included in selling, general and administrative expenses
along with other operating costs. As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks
throughout our industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution
companies. Total distribution network costs from continuing operations were $488million, $442
million and $423million for 2007, 2006 and 2005. Stock-Based Compensation Effective January1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of FAS No123R, Share-Based Payment.
We previously applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of FAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, in our consolidated financial statements. We elected to
adopt the modified retrospective application method provided by FAS 123R, and accordingly,
financial statement amounts for all prior periods presented herein reflect results as if the fair
value method of expensing such share-based payments had been applied from the original effective
date of FAS 123. Such results are consistent with our previously reported pro forma disclosures
required under FAS 123. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded
directly as an adjustment to stockholders equity. Our comprehensive income is primarily comprised
of net income and foreign currency translation adjustments, but also includes unrealized gains on
hedging activity and pension adjustments. The following table summarizes the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net

In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued Accounting Changes In July2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FAS Interpretation No.
48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FAS No109 FIN 48.
FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial
statements in accordance with FAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognitions and
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to
be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the
taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is
greater than 50percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The adoption of FIN 48,
effective December31, 2006, resulted in a decrease to stockholders equity of approximately $03
million. In September2006, the FASB issued FAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and
132R. FAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the over- or under-funded status of a defined
benefit plan as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize
changes in that funded status, net of tax through comprehensive income, in the year in which the
changes occur. FAS 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a defined benefit
plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. The provisions of FAS 158
became effective for our year ended December30, 2006, with the exception of the requirement to
measure the funded status of retirement benefit plans as of our fiscal year end, which is effective
for our fiscal year ending December27, 2008. During December2006, we implemented the requirement
to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit plans. Recognizing the funded status of our
defined benefit plans did not have a material impact on our statement of financial position. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In September2006, the FASB issued FAS No157, Fair Value Measurements FAS 157. FAS
157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 applies under other previously
issued accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not
require any new fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with
the exception of all non-financial assets and liabilities, except those items recognized or
disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequently recurring basis, which will be effective
for years beginning after November15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of FAS 157 on
our consolidated financial statements. In February2007, FASB issued FAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities FAS 159, including an amendment to FASB No115. FAS 159 provides
entities with the irrevocable option to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities
and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not
permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election, called
the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in
fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge
accounting provisions. FAS 159 is effective as of the beginning of a companys first fiscal year
that begins after November15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of FAS 159 on our
consolidated financial statements. 60 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies Continued In December2007, the FASB issued Statement No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations,
and Statement No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. FAS No141
revised 2007 requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition
date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. This standard
also requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and liabilities related to the
acquisition such as contingencies. FAS 141 revised 2007 applies prospectively to business
combinations and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. We are
currently evaluating the impact that FAS 141 revised 2007 will have on our accounting for past
and future acquisitions and our consolidated financial statements. Statement No160 requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as
equity in the consolidated financial statements. Consolidated net income should include the net
income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest with disclosure of both amounts on the
consolidated statement of income. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based
on income amounts attributable to the parent. The presentation provisions of FAS 160 are to be
applied retrospectively, and FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December
15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS 160 will have on our consolidated
financial statements. Note 2 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Our diluted earnings per share is computed similarly to
basic earnings per share, except that it reflects the effect of common shares issuable upon vesting
of restricted stock and upon exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method in periods
in which they have a dilutive effect. For the years ended December29, 2007 and December30, 2006, diluted earnings per share
includes the effect of common shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt. During the
period, the debt was convertible at a premium as a result of the conditions of the debt. As a
result, the amount in excess of the principal is presumed to be settled in common shares and is
reflected in our calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the year ended December31, 2005, diluted earnings per share does not include the effect
of common shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt, as the debt was not convertible
at a premium during these periods. A reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share follows

Non-compete agreements represent amounts paid primarily to key employees and prior owners of
acquired businesses in exchange for placing restrictions on their ability to pose a competitive
risk to us. Such amounts are amortized, on a straight-line basis over the respective non-compete
period, which generally commences upon termination of employment or separation from us. The
weighted-average non-compete period for agreements currently being amortized was approximately five
years as of December29, 2007. Trademarks, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships were established through
business acquisitions. Certain trademarks and trade names, totaling $274million and $254
million as of December29, 2007 and December30, 2006, are deemed indefinite-lived intangible
assets and are not amortized. The remainder are deemed definite-lived and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately four years as of December29,
2007. Customer relationships and customer lists are definite-lived intangible assets that are
amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of approximately 10years as of
December29, 2007. Amortization expense, from continuing operations, related to definite-lived intangible assets
for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $238million, $180million and $142million. The annual
amortization expense expected for the years 2008 through 2012 is $273million, $242million 206million, $192million and $179million. 63 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

million, $27million and $17million. Note 6 Business Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions Acquisitions Effective September29, 2007, we acquired Software of Excellence International Ltd., NZX:
SOE, a provider of clinical and practice management solutions for dental professionals, for
NZ$290 per share. The total purchase price, including fees, was approximately $622million. SOE
has annual revenues of approximately $200million. We recorded approximately $565million of
goodwill related to this acquisition. On August29, 2007, we acquired WJ Dunlop, Ltd., a leading supplier of animal health products
and services to veterinary clinics in the United Kingdom, with annual revenues of approximately
$2970million, for a purchase price, including fees, of approximately $684million. We recorded
approximately $331million of goodwill related to this acquisition. On July2, 2007, we completed the acquisition of the 50% of Becker-Parkin Dental Supply Co.
Becker-Parkin, with annual revenues of approximately $695million, that we did not own for a
purchase price of approximately $22million, less Becker-Parkin debt and subject to an earnout and
certain other adjustments. We then integrated the full service and special markets portions of
this business into our existing dental operations. We recorded a pretax gain of approximately $24million
relating to the dispositions of certain non-core businesses of Becker-Parkin. These dispositions
included the contribution of certain non-core businesses of Becker-Parkin into an unconsolidated
entity. We will continue to account for this investment using the equity method. In addition to the foregoing acquisitions, we completed other acquisitions during the year
ended December29, 2007. The operating results of these other acquisitions are also reflected in
our financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. These other acquisitions were
immaterial to our financial statements individually and in the aggregate. 64 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

In thousands, except share and per share data Note 6 Business Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions Continued On June30, 2006, we acquired from Darby Group Companies, Inc. the Darby Group certain
assets and assumed certain liabilities of a privately held full-service distributor of dental
merchandise and equipment. During the third quarter of 2006, we acquired from the Darby Group
certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a privately held full-line distributor serving
the dental lab community nationwide and a privately held provider of medical supplies and
pharmaceutical products, including generic drugs, branded drugs and vaccines to small medical
practices nationwide. This group of acquisitions the Darby Acquisitions had combined annual
revenues of approximately $2190million. We recorded $141million of goodwill related to the
Darby Acquisitions. On March31, 2006, we completed the acquisition of NLS Animal Health NLS, a privately
held, full-service animal health distribution business, with annual revenues of approximately
$1100million. We recorded $506million of goodwill related to this acquisition. In addition to the foregoing acquisitions, we completed other acquisitions during the year
ended December30, 2006. The operating results of these other acquisitions are also reflected in
our financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. These other acquisitions were
immaterial to our financial statements individually and in the aggregate. On January11, 2005, we acquired the dental products distribution business of Ash Temple
Limited Ash Temple, a privately held full-service dental distributor based in Ontario, Canada
with annual revenues of approximately $1000million. We recorded $165million of goodwill
related to this acquisition. The operating results of Ash Temple are reflected in the accompanying
financial statements since the date of acquisition. On April18, 2005, regulatory authorities approved our pending acquisition of our Demedis
Groups business in Austria, which operates under the Austrodent brand. This approval was
contingent upon our divesting, at closing, a portion of Austrodents business, not using the
Austrodent name, as well as other restrictions. Of the total purchase price for the Demedis Group 135million was attributable to Austrodent, which was paid in 2004 and recorded as an other
current asset. Upon acquiring Austrodent, this amount, less approximately $21million received in
exchange for the divested portion of the business, was reclassified based on the fair value of the
remaining assets and liabilities acquired, with an increase of $86million to goodwill for the
excess purchase price over fair value. In addition to the Ash Temple and Austrodent acquisitions, we completed other acquisitions in
Australia, New Zealand and the United States, which resulted in the recording of approximately
$115million of goodwill through preliminary purchase price allocations during the year ended
December31, 2005. These acquisitions were immaterial individually and in the aggregate. Divestitures During 2007, we sold substantially all of the assets of our oncology pharmaceutical and
specialty pharmacy businesses, previously reported as part of our healthcare distribution
reportable segment. The aggregate sales price was $143million, which was received in 2007. As a
result of this sale, included in the operating results from discontinued operations for 2007 is a
$11million $07million after-tax net gain on the sale of the businesses. Also, because the
decision to divest this business was reached in 2007 65 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 6 Business Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions Continued we recorded an impairment charge to our long-lived assets of approximately $206million, net of
tax, or $023 per diluted share in 2007. Net sales generated by our oncology pharmaceutical and specialty pharmacy businesses were
$811million, $1049million and $1099million for the years ended December29, 2007, December
30, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively. On April1, 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Hospital Supply Business,
previously reported as part of our healthcare distribution reportable segment. The sale price was
$365million, which was received during the second quarter of 2006. As a result of this sale,
included in the operating results from discontinued operations for 2006 is a $323million $194
million after-tax loss on the sale, including $35million $21million after-tax of
transitional service obligations and selling costs. Net sales generated by our Hospital Supply Business were $379million for the three months
ended April1, 2006 and $1528million for the year ended December31, 2005. Loan and Investment Agreement As of December29, 2007, we loaned D4D Technologies, LLC D4D $131million and, if certain
operational milestones are achieved, up to an additional $164million of loans will be made in
increments by May2010. We have previously agreed to certain amendments to the operating milestones and we have advanced certain amounts to fund D4Ds operating needs without regard to the milestones. The loans, a portion of which can be converted to equity investments, are
repayable on various dates through July2013.
We expect to account for any such equity investments under the equity method prospectively from the date of our first equity investment. Note 7 Debt Bank Credit Lines We have a $3000million revolving credit facility with a $1000million expansion feature.
This facility expires in May2010. The interest rate is based on USD LIBOR plus a spread based on
our leverage ratio at the end of each financial reporting quarter. The agreement provides, among
other things, that we maintain certain interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios, and contains
restrictions relating to subsidiary indebtedness, liens, employee and shareholder loans, disposal
of businesses and certain changes in ownership. As of December29, 2007, there were $111million
of letters of credit provided to third parties and no borrowings outstanding under this revolving
credit facility. As of December29, 2007, we had various short-term bank credit lines available, of which
approximately $90million was outstanding. As of December29, 2007, such credit lines had a
weighted average interest rate of 56%. Our bank credit lines were uncollateralized at December
29, 2007. 66 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

In prior years, we completed private placement transactions under which we issued $1300
million and $1000million in senior notes. The $1300million notes mature on June30, 2009 and
bear interest at a fixed rate of 69% per annum. Principal payments on the $1000million notes of
$200million annually commenced September25, 2006 and the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of
67% per annum. Interest on both notes is payable semi-annually. In 2003, we entered into agreements relating to our $2300million senior notes to exchange
their fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The value of debt exchanged to a variable
rate of interest reduces according to the repayment schedule of the senior notes. As of December
29, 2007, there is $1900million of principal remaining with a weighted-average interest rate of
838%. For the year ended December29, 2007, the weighted-average variable interest rate was
842%. This weighted-average variable interest rate is comprised of LIBOR plus a spread and resets
on the interest due dates for such senior notes. The interest rate swap agreements are
marked-to-market at each balance sheet date, with an offsetting adjustment to the senior notes. The agreement governing our senior notes provides, among other things, that we will maintain
on a consolidated basis, certain leverage and priority debt ratios and a minimum net worth. The
agreement also contains restrictions relating to transactions with affiliates, annual dividends,
mergers and acquisitions and liens. The agreements limit the distribution of dividends without the
prior written consent of the lenders limited to $250million, plus 80% of cumulative net income,
plus net proceeds from the issuance of
additional capital stock. As of December29, 2007, the amount of retained earnings free of
restrictions was $6445million. 67 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

In thousands, except share and per share data Note 7 Debt Continued In 2004, we completed an issuance of $2400million of convertible debt. These notes are
senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 30% and are due to mature on
August15, 2034. Interest on the notes is payable on February15 and August15 of each year. The
notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of 2158 shares per one thousand
dollars of principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $4634 per
share, under the following circumstances   
if the price of our common stock is above 130% of the conversion price measured over
a specified number of trading days   
during the five-business-day period following any 10-consecutive-trading-day period
in which the average of the trading prices for the notes for that 10-trading-day period
was less than 98% of the average conversion value for the notes during that period   
if the notes have been called for redemption; or   
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified corporate
transactions, as defined in the note agreement. Upon conversion, we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the
principal amount of the notes to be converted, in cash, with any remaining amount to be satisfied
in shares of our common stock. We currently have sufficient availability of funds through our
$3000million revolving credit facility along with cash on hand to fully satisfy the cash portion
of our conversion obligation. We also will pay contingent interest during any six-month-interest
period beginning August20, 2010, if the average trading price of the notes is above specified
levels. We may redeem some or all of the notes on or after August20, 2010. The note holders may
require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on August15, 2010, 2014, 2019, 2024 and 2029
or, subject to specified exceptions, upon a change of control event. As of December29, 2007, the aggregate amounts of long-term debt, including capital leases,
maturing in each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows: 2008 $243million; 2009
- - $1516million; 2010 $212million; 2011 $07million; 2012 $03million; 2013 and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 8 Income Taxes Continued The deferred income tax asset is realizable as we have sufficient taxable income in prior
years and anticipate sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the tax benefit for
deductible temporary differences. As of December29, 2007, we have domestic unconsolidated net operating loss carryforwards of
$227million. Of such losses, $162million can be utilized against future federal income through
2026, and $65million can be utilized against future federal income through 2027. Foreign net
operating loss carryforwards totaled $2573million as of December29, 2007. Of such losses, $09
million can be utilized against future foreign income through 2012, $08million can be utilized
against future foreign income through 2013, $26million can be utilized against future foreign
income through 2014, and $2530million has an indefinite life. The tax provisions from continuing operations differ from the amount computed using the

Adjusted to reflect the effects of discontinued operations. For the year ended December29, 2007, our effective tax rate from continuing operations was
340% compared to 356% for the prior year period. The difference was impacted by additional tax
planning, settlements of tax audits, revaluation of deferred income taxes, a non-recurring tax
charge resulting from a European restructuring, and higher income from lower taxing countries. The
difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for both periods
related primarily to foreign and state income taxes. As a result of tax legislation enacted in Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy for 2007,
deferred income taxes were revalued resulting in a $56million reduction in deferred income tax
accounts and a corresponding reduction of income tax expense. Additionally, in response to the
legislation enacted in Germany, a restructuring was implemented in 2007 resulting in a
non-recurring income tax charge of $35million. Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries, which have been and will continue to be reinvested. These earnings could
become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were
loaned to us or a U.S. affiliate, or if we should sell our stock in the foreign subsidiaries. It
is not practicable to determine the amount of
additional tax, if any, that might be payable on the foreign earnings. As of December29,
2007, the cumulative amount of reinvested foreign subsidiary earnings was approximately $857
million. 70 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 8 Income Taxes Continued In July2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FAS No109 FIN 48. FIN 48
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in
accordance with FAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of
tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized,
a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing
authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater
than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The adoption of FIN 48, effective
December31, 2006, resulted in a decrease to stockholders equity of approximately $03million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was approximately
$127million, all of which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits as of December29, 2007 was approximately $125million, all of which
would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. It is expected that the amount of unrecognized
tax benefits will change in the next 12months; however, we do not expect the change to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The total amounts of interest and penalties, which are classified as a component of the
provision for income taxes, were approximately $20million and $0, respectively, as of the date of
adoption. The total amounts of interest and penalties were approximately $22million and $0,
respectively, as of December29, 2007. It is expected that the amount of interest will change in
the next twelve months. However, we do not expect the change to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. The tax years subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions include the years 2004 and
forward by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the years 1996 and forward for certain states and the
years 1997 and forward for certain foreign jurisdictions. The following table provides a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 9 Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk Fair Values of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value Cash equivalents and trade receivables Due to the short-term maturity of such instruments,
the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value. Available-for-sale securities The fair value of available-for-sale securities is estimated
based on quoted market prices for such securities. Long-term investments and notes receivable There are no quoted market prices available for
investments in unconsolidated affiliates and long-term notes receivable; however, we believe the
carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value. Long-term debt The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on quoted market
prices for our traded debt and on market prices of similar issues for our private debt. The
fair value of our long-term debt as of December29, 2007 and December30, 2006 was estimated at $4566million and
$4994million. Derivative instruments The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts and interest
rate swap agreements are estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers. Such instruments are
carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value liability of our foreign currency forward
contracts as of December29, 2007 and December30, 2006 was estimated at $37million and $87
million, which approximated the amounts paid for the contracts. The fair value liabilityof
our interest rate swap agreements was estimated at $12 million and $67 million,
representing the estimated amounts we would have paid to terminate the agreements as of December
29, 2007 and December30, 2006. These amounts take into account current interest rates, market
expectations for future interest rates and our current credit worthiness. Concentrations of Credit Risk Certain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk. These
financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, trade
receivables, long-term investments, notes receivable and derivative instruments. In all cases, our
maximum exposure to loss from credit risk equals the gross fair value of the financial instruments.
We continuously assess the need for reserves for such losses, which have historically been within
our expectations. We do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments
subject to credit risk, except for long-term notes receivable. With respect to our cash equivalents, the majority of our available-for-sale securities,
short-term and long-term investments and derivative instruments, our credit risk is limited due to
our counter-parties being high-credit quality financial institutions. As a risk management policy,
we limit the amount of credit exposure by utilizing numerous different counter-parties. 72 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 9 Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk Continued With respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively
large customer base and its dispersion across different types of healthcare professionals and
geographic areas. No single customer accounted for more than 12% of our net sales in 2007. Our long-term notes receivable represent strategic financing arrangements with certain
industry affiliates and amounts owed to us from sales of certain businesses. Generally, these
notes are secured by
certain assets of the counter-party; however, in most cases our security is subordinate to other
commercial financial institutions. While we have exposure to credit loss in the event of
non-performance by these counter-parties, we conduct ongoing assessments of their financial and
operational performance. Note 10 Segment and Geographic Data We conduct our business through two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and
technology. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. The
healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental, medical including animal health
and international operating segments. This segment consists of consumable products, small
equipment, laboratory products, large dental and medical equipment, equipment repair services, branded and
generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products
and vitamins. Our dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, schools and other institutions in
the combined United States and Canadian dental market. Our medical group serves office-based
medical practitioners, surgical centers, other alternate-care settings, animal health clinics and
other institutions throughout the United States. Our international group serves 18 countries
outside of North America. Our technology group provides software, technology and other value-added services to
healthcare practitioners, primarily in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and
New Zealand. Our value-added practice solutions include practice-management software systems for
dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics. Our technology group offerings also
include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners. 73 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 11 Stockholders Equity On January31, 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split effected in the form of a dividend. This stock split became effective on February28, 2005
and has been retroactively reflected for all periods presented in the accompanying financial
statements and footnotes. Effective May25, 2005, we increased our authorized common shares from 120,000,000 to
240,000,000 in connection with the above stock split. Common Stock Purchase Rights On November30, 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan the Rights
Plan, and declared a dividend under the Rights Plan of one common stock purchase right a
Right on each outstanding share of our common stock. Until the occurrence of certain events,
each share of common stock that is issued will also have attached to it a Right. The Rights
provide, in substance, that should any person or group acquire 15% or more of our outstanding
common stock after the date of adoption of the Rights Plan, each Right, other than Rights held by
the acquiring person or group, would entitle its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of
common stock for 50% of the then-current market value of the common stock. Unless a 15%
acquisition has occurred, we may redeem the Rights at any time prior to the termination date of the
Rights Plan. This Right to purchase the common stock at a discount will not be triggered by a
persons or groups acquisition of 15% or more of the common stock pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer which is for all outstanding shares at a price and on terms that the Board of Directors

addition, the Rights will not be triggered by the positions of existing shareholders. Certain business combinations involving an acquiring person or its affiliates will trigger an
additional feature of the Rights. Each Right, other than Rights held by the acquiring person or
group, will entitle its holder to purchase a certain number of shares of common stock of the
acquiring person at a price equal to 50% of the market value of such shares at the time of
exercise. Initially, the Rights will be attached to, and trade with, the certificates representing
our outstanding shares of common stock and no separate certificates representing the Rights will be
distributed. The Rights will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires, or commences a
tender or exchange offer for, 15% or more of our common stock. The Board of Directors may, at its option, redeem all, but not less than all, of the then
outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $001 per Right at any time prior to the earlier of a

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 12 Employee Benefit Plans Stock Option and Awards Effective January1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of FAS No123R, Share-Based Payment.
We previously applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of FAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, in our consolidated financial statements. We elected to
adopt the modified retrospective application method provided by FAS 123R. Our accompanying consolidated statements of income reflect pre-tax share-based compensation
expense of $226million $149million after-tax, $195million $125million after-tax and
$182million $116million after-tax for the years ended December29, 2007, December30, 2006
and December31, 2005. Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows present our stock-based compensation
expense as an adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities for
all periods presented. Additionally, prior to adopting FAS 123R, benefits associated with tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense were presented as part of operating cash
flow on our consolidated statements of cash flows. However, FAS 123R requires that such excess
tax benefits be presented as a cash inflow from financing activities. In the accompanying
consolidated statements of cash flows, we presented $127million, $149million and $104million
of such excess tax benefits as a cash inflow from financing activities for the years ended December
29, 2007, December30, 2006 and December31, 2005. Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to
employees and non-employee directors. We measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based
on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognize the cost as compensation expense on a
straight-line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period. Our
stock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in
our consolidated statements of income. Stock-based awards are provided to certain employees and non-employee directors under the
terms of our 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and our 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended together, the Plans. The Plans are administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors. Awards under the Plans principally include a combination of
at-the-money stock options and restricted stock including restricted stock units. As of December
29, 2007, there were 23,777,270 shares authorized and 5,089,917 shares available to be granted
under the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan and 800,000 shares authorized and 266,837 shares available to
be granted under the 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan. Stock options are awards that allow the recipient to purchase shares of our common stock at a
fixed price. Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to our closing stock price on
the date of grant. These awards, which generally vest 25% per year based on the recipients
continued service subject to the terms and conditions of the Plans, are fully vested four years
from the grant date and have a contractual term of ten years from the grant date. Additionally,
recipients may not sell any shares that they acquire through exercising their stock options until
the third anniversary of the date of grant of such options. We estimate the fair value of stock
options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. 78 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 12 Employee Benefit Plans Continued Grants of restricted stock are common stock awards granted to recipients with specified
vesting provisions. We issue restricted stock that vests based on the recipients continued
service over time four-year cliff vesting and restricted stock that vests based on our achieving
specified performance measurements three-year cliff vesting. With respect to time-based restricted stock, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant
based on our closing stock price. With respect to performance-based restricted stock, the number
of shares that ultimately vest and are received by the recipient is based upon our earnings per
share performance measured against specified targets over a three-year period as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Though there is no guarantee that performance
targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based restricted stock, based
on our closing stock price, assuming that performance targets will be achieved. Over the
performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will ultimately vest and be issued is
adjusted upward or downward based upon our estimation of achieving such performance targets. The
ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the related compensation cost recognized as
an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics. Restricted stock units, or RSUs, are unit awards we grant to certain non-U.S. employees that
entitle the recipient to shares of common stock upon vesting after four years for time-based awards
or three years for performance-based awards. The fair value of RSUs is determined on the date of
grant, based on our closing stock price. We record deferred income tax assets for awards that result in deductions on our income tax
returns based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate in the
jurisdiction in which we will receive a deduction. Differences between the deferred income tax
assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our
income tax return are recorded in additional paid-in capital if the tax deduction exceeds the
deferred income tax asset or in earnings if the deferred income tax asset exceeds the tax
deduction and no additional paid-in capital exists from previous awards. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December29, 2007 and December30, 2006
was generated through stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants. Certain
options granted require us to settle the option in the form of a cash payment. As of December29,
2007, we have recorded a liability of $183 relating to fair value measurement of these options.
For the year ended December31, 2005, the majority of stock-based compensation expense was
generated through stock options. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-based awards
granted before forfeitures was $2161, $2446 and $1338 per share during the years ended December
29, 2007, December30, 2006 and December31, 2005. For the year ended December29, 2007, the fair
value of stock-based awards issued was evenly divided between stock options and restricted stock
including RSUs. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards as of December29, 2007 was
$406million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
two years. There were no significant capitalized stock-based compensation costs as of December29,
2007. 79 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

We have not declared cash dividends on our stock in the past and we do not anticipate
declaring cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The expected stock price volatility is based
on the evaluation of implied volatilities from traded call options on our stock and from call
options embedded in our existing convertible debt, historical volatility of our stock and other
factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the
date of grant in conjunction with considering the expected life of options. The expected life of
options represents the approximate period of time that granted options are expected to be
outstanding and is based on historical data, including, among other things, option exercises,
forfeitures and cancellations. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future
events or the value ultimately realized by recipients of stock options, and subsequent events are
not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us. The following table represents the intrinsic values of

determined by our Board of Directors, matching contributions to these plans generally do not exceed
100% of the participants contributions up to 7% of their base compensation, subject to applicable
legal limits. Matching contributions include both cash and our common stock. Forfeitures
attributable to participants whose employment terminates prior to becoming fully vested are used to reduce our matching
contributions. Assets of the 401k and other defined contribution plans are held in self-directed accounts
enabling participants to choose from various investment fund options. Matching contributions to
these plans charged to operations during 2007, 2006 and 2005 amounted to $201million, $171

We have obligations to purchase influenza vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, or GSK,
and Novartis AG through 2014, which, with respect to GSK, require us to pay an amount per dose
based on the prevailing market price or a formula price in each respective year. The amounts
included in the above table related to these purchase commitments were determined using current
market conditions. Actual amounts may differ. Litigation Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of
business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our
distribution of pharmaceutical, medical devices and other healthcare products. As a business practice, we generally obtain
product liability indemnification from our suppliers. We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks in
amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with
products manufactured by others, the manufacturer provides us with indemnification. There can be
no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate
amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate
protection. In our opinion, all pending matters are covered by insurance or will not otherwise
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As of December29, 2007, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to
product liability and other claims that were probable to result in a liability and for which we
were able to reasonably estimate a loss. This accrued amount, as well as related expenses, was not
material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our method for
determining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and
regulations and other external factors, including probable recoveries from third parties. 83 Table of Contents HENRY SCHEIN, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In thousands, except share and per share data Note 15 Quarterly Information Unaudited Continued We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed
the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to
decline. Our business has been subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Net sales and
operating profits generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of
sales of software, equipment and seasonal products including influenza vaccine, equipment and
software products, purchasing patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and year-end
promotions. Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter,
primarily due to increased sales in the
prior two quarters. Quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other
factors, including   
costs of developing new applications and services   
costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or
businesses   
the timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures   
loss of sales representatives   
general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related
industries   
the timing of the release of functions of our technology-related products and services   
our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships   
changes in accounting principles   
product availability or recalls by manufacturers   
exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the
use of the products we sell results in injury; and   
increases in the cost of shipping or service trouble with our third party shippers. Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly
operating results to fluctuate. If our operating results do not meet or exceed market
expectations, our stock price may decline. 86 Table of Contents Item 1.

executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
annual report as such term is defined in Rules13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of December29, 2007 to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and that all such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as
specified in the SECs rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended December29, 2007 we completed a J.D. Edwards Enterprise Resource
Planning, or ERP, system implementation for our Canadian dental business as well as an SAP
warehouse management system in Germany. These changes were related to controls surrounding annual
net sales of approximately $5380million, and when considered in aggregate with the initiatives
described below related to acquisitions, acquisition integrations and systems implementations,
represent a material change in our internal control over financial reporting. Acquisitions, including WJ Dunlop, Ltd. and Software of Excellence International Ltd., with
approximate aggregate annual revenues of $3390million, each utilizing separate information and
financial accounting systems, have been included in our consolidated financial statements. In
addition, acquisitions, including Becker-Parkin Dental Supply Co., with approximate aggregate
annual revenues of $940million, have been integrated into our existing ERP systems in the United
States and Europe, and are covered by our existing system of internal control over financial
reporting. Finally, there have been ongoing implementations of new systems and system enhancements
which were undertaken during the year to improve business process control and management reporting
as well as strengthen internal control over external financial reporting. These changes were
related to controls surrounding annual net sales of approximately $10billion and expenses
totaling approximately $1000million. All new and existing system implementations and enhancements as well as acquisitions and
acquisition integrations have involved necessary and appropriate change-management controls that
are considered in our annual assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Our internal control
system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Under the
supervision and with the 87 Table of Contents participation of our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO
Framework. Based on our evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level as of
December29, 2007. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December29, 2007 has
been independently audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
and their attestation is included herein. Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. 88 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors
Henry Schein, Inc.
Melville, New York We have audited Henry Schein, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December29,
2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Henry Schein,
Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Item9A, Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Henry Schein, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December29, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Henry Schein, Inc. as of December29,
2007 and December30, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December29, 2007 and our
report dated February25, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ BDO Seidman, LLP New York, New York
