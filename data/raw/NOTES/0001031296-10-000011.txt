Matters
Proposed
Merger with Allegheny Energy, Inc.
On
February 10, 2010, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Allegheny the
consummation of which will result, among other things, in our becoming an
electric utility holding company for:
generation
subsidiaries owning or controlling approximately 24,000 MWs of generating
capacity from a diversified mix of regional coal, nuclear, natural gas,
oil and renewable power,
ten
regulated electric distribution subsidiaries providing electric service to
more than six million customers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, New
Jersey, New York, Virginia and West Virginia, and
transmission
subsidiaries owning over 20,000 miles of high-voltage lines connecting the
Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.
Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will
merge with and into Allegheny with Allegheny continuing as the surviving
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy.Pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, upon the closing of the merger, each issued and
outstanding share of Allegheny common stock, including grants of restricted
common stock, will automatically be converted into the right to receive 0667 of
a share of common stock of FirstEnergy. Completion of the merger is
conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval of both
companies as well as expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and approval by
the FERC, the Maryland Public Service Commission, PPUC, the Virginia State
Corporation Commission and the West Virginia Public Service Commission. We
anticipate that the necessary approvals will be obtained within 12 to 14 months.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and
Allegheny, and further provides for the payment of fees and expenses upon
termination under specified circumstances. Further information concerning the
proposed merger will be included in a joint proxy statement/prospectus contained
in the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed by us with the SEC in
connection with the merger.
47
Financing
Activities
In 2009,
we issued approximately $37billion of long-term debt excluding PCRBs 22billion for our Energy Delivery Services Segment and $15billion
for our Competitive Energy Services Segment. The primary use of the proceeds
related to the repayment of long-term debt of $19 billion and short-term
borrowings of $12 billion primarily from the $275billion revolver, to
finance capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes, including
the Utilities and ATSIs voluntary contribution of $500 million to the pension
plan. As a result, we extended the maturity schedule of long-term debt to an
average of 145 years, an increase of two years from 2008. Additionally,
throughout 2009, FGCO and NGC remarketed and issued $940 million of PCRBs, of
which $776million was placed in fixed rate modes.
Rating
Agency Actions
On
February 11, 2010, SP issued a report lowering FirstEnergys and its
subsidiaries credit ratings by one notch, while maintaining its stable
outlook.As a result, FirstEnergy may be required to post up to $48
million of collateral see Note 15B. Moody and Fitch affirmed the ratings
and stable outlook of FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries on February 11, 2010.
These rating agency actions were taken in response to the announcement of the
proposed merger with Allegheny.
Previously,
on June 17, 2009, Moodys had issued a report affirming FirstEnergys Baa3 and
FES Baa2 credit ratings and maintained its stable outlook and, on July 9, 2009,
SP had reaffirmed its since-lowered ratings on FirstEnergy and its
subsidiaries, including a BBB corporate credit rating, and maintained its then
current stable outlook.
In
addition, on August 3, 2009, Moodys upgraded the senior secured debt ratings of
FirstEnergys seven regulated utilities as follows: CEI and TE were each
upgraded to Baa1 from Baa2, and JCPL, Met-Ed, OE, Penelec and Penn were
each upgraded to A3 from Baa1.
Sumpter
Plant Sale
On
December 17, 2009, FirstEnergy announced that its FGCO subsidiary reached an
agreement in principle to sell its 340MW Sumpter Plant in Sumpter,
Michigan, resulting in an impairment charge in 2009 of approximately
$6million $4million, after tax. The sale is expected to close in
first quarter of 2010.
The plant, built in 2002 by FGCO, consists of four 85-MW natural gas combustion
turbines.
OVEC
Participation Interest Sale
On May
1, 2009, FGCO sold a 9% interest in the output from OVEC for $252million
214 MW from OVECs generating facilities in southern Indiana and Ohio. FGCOs
remaining interest in OVEC was reduced to 115%. This transaction increased 2009
net income by $159million.
Legacy
Power Contracts
During
2008, in anticipation of certain regulatory actions, FES entered into purchased
power contracts representing approximately 44million MWH per year for
MISO delivery in 2010 and 2011. These contracts, which represented less than 10%
of FES estimated Ohio load, were intended to cover potential short positions
that were anticipated in those years and qualified for the normal purchase
normal sale scope exception under accounting for derivatives and hedging. In the
fourth quarter of 2009, as FES determined that the short positions in 2010 and
2011 were not expected to materialize based on reductions in PLR obligations and
decreased demand due to economic conditions, the contracts were modified to
financially settle to avoid congestion and transmission expenses associated with
physical delivery. As a result of the modification, the fair value of the
contracts was recorded, resulting in a mark-to-market charge of approximately
$205million $129million, after tax to purchased power expense. For
all other purchased power contracts qualifying for the normal purchase normal
sale scope exception, FES expects to take physical delivery of the power over
the remaining term of the contracts.
Operational
Matters
Recessionary
Market Conditions and Weather Impacts
Customers'
demand for electricity produced and sold by FirstEnergys competitive
subsidiary, FES, along with the value of that electricity, has been impacted by
conditions in competitive power markets, macro and micro economic conditions,
and weather conditions in FirstEnergys service territories. Recessionary
economic conditions, particularly in the automotive and steel industries,
compounded by unusually mild regional summertime temperatures, adversely
affected FirstEnergys operations and revenues in 2009. Generation output for
2009 was 659million MWH versus 2008 output of 824 million
MWH.
48
Customers
demand for electricity affects FirstEnergys distribution, transmission and
generation revenues, the quantity of electricity produced, purchased power
expense and fuel expense. FirstEnergy has taken various actions and instituted a
number of changes in operating practices designed to mitigate the impact of
these external influences. These actions included employee severances, wage
reductions, employee and retiree benefit changes, reduced levels of overtime and
the use of fewer contractors. Any continuing recessionary economic conditions,
coupled with unusually mild weather patterns and the resulting impact on
electricity prices and demand could also adversely affect FirstEnergy results
of operations and financial condition and could require further changes in
FirstEnergys operations.
FirstEnergy
Reorganization and Voluntary Enhanced Retirement Option
Beginning
March 3, 2009, FirstEnergy reduced its management and support staff by 348
employees during 2009. This staffing reduction resulted from an effort to
enhance efficiencies in response to the economic downturn. The reduction
represented approximately 45% of FirstEnergys non-union workforce. Total
one-time charges associated with the reorganization were approximately
$66million $41million, after tax, or $014 per share of common
stock.
In June
2009, FirstEnergy offered a VERO, which provided additional benefits for
qualified employees who elected to retire. The VERO was accepted by 397
non-represented employees and 318 union employees.
PJM
Regional Transmission Organization RTO Integration
On
August 17, 2009, FirstEnergy filed an application with the FERC to consolidate
its transmission assets and operations into PJM. Currently, FirstEnergy
transmission assets and operations are divided between PJM and MISO. The
consolidation would move the transmission assets that are part of FirstEnergy
ATSI subsidiary and are located within the footprint of the Ohio Companies and
Penn - into PJM. On December17, 2009, a FERC order approving the
integration and outlining the terms required for the move was issued and on
December18, 2009, ATSI announced that it signed an agreement to join PJM.
FirstEnergy plans to integrate its operations into PJM by June1,
2011.
Beaver
Valley Power Station License Renewal
On
November 5, 2009, FENOC announced that the NRC approved a 20-year license
extension for Beaver Valley Power Station Units 1 and 2 until 2036 and 2047,
respectively. Beaver Valley is located in Shippingport, Pennsylvania and is
capable of generating 1,815 MW and is the 56th out of 104 nuclear reactors in
the United States to receive a license extension from the NRC.
Refueling
Outages
On
February 23, 2009, the Perry Plant began its 12th
scheduled refueling and maintenance outage, in which 280 of the plants 748 fuel
assemblies were exchanged, safety inspections were conducted, and several
maintenance projects were completed, including replacement of the plants
recirculation pump motor. On May13, 2009, the Perry Plant returned to
service.
On April
20, 2009, Beaver Valley Unit 1 began its 19th scheduled refueling and
maintenance outage. During the outage, 62 of the 157 fuel assemblies were
exchanged and safety inspections were conducted. Also, several projects were
completed to ensure continued safe and reliable operations, including
maintenance on the cooling tower and the replacement of a pump motor. On May 21,
2009, Beaver Valley Unit 1 returned to service.
On
October 12, 2009, Beaver Valley Unit 2 began a scheduled refueling and
maintenance outage. During the outage, 60 of the 157 fuel assemblies were
exchanged and safety inspections were conducted. In addition, numerous
improvement projects were completed to ensure continued safe and reliable
operations. On November27, 2009, Beaver Valley Unit 2 returned to
service.
R.
E. Burger Plant
On April
1, 2009, FirstEnergy announced plans to retrofit Units 4 and 5 at its R.E.
Burger Plant to repower the units with biomass. Retrofitting the Burger Plant is
expected to help meet the renewable energy goals set forth in Ohio SB221, will
utilize much of the existing infrastructure currently in place, preserve
approximately 100 jobs and continue positive economic support to Belmont County,
Ohio. Once complete, the Burger Plant will be one of the largest biomass
facilities in the United States. The capital cost for retrofitting the Burger
Plant is estimated to be approximately $200 million, and once completed, is
expected to be capable of producing up to 312 MW of electricity.
49
Fremont
Energy Center
On
September 22, 2009, FirstEnergy announced that it expects to complete
construction of the Fremont Energy Center by the end of 2010. Originally
acquired by FGCO in January 2008, the Fremont Energy Center includes two natural
gas combined-cycle combustion turbines and a steam turbine capable of producing
544 MW of load-following capacity and 163 MW of peaking capacity. With the
accelerated construction schedule, the remaining cost to complete the project is
estimated to be approximately $150million.
Norton
Energy Storage Project
On
November 23, 2009, FGCO announced that it purchased a 92-acre site in Norton,
Ohio, for approximately $35million to develop a compressed-air electric
generating plant. The transaction includes rights to a 600-acre underground
cavern ideal for energy storage technology. With 96 million cubic meters of
storage, the Norton Energy Storage Project has the potential to be expanded to
up to 2,700 MW of capacity. The Norton Energy Storage Project is part of
FirstEnergy overall environmental strategy, which includes continued
investment in renewable and low-emitting energy resources.
Labor
Agreements
On May
21, 2009, 517 Penelec employees, represented by the IBEW Local 459, elected to
strike. In response, on May 22, 2009, Penelec implemented its work-continuation
plan to use nearly 400 non-represented employees with previous line experience
and training drawn from Penelec and other FirstEnergy operations to perform
service reliability and priority maintenance work in Penelecs service
territory. Penelec IBEW Local 459 employees ratified a three-year contract
agreement on July19, 2009, and returned to work on July20,
2009.
On June
26, 2009, FirstEnergy announced that seven of its union locals, representing
about 2,600 employees, ratified contract extensions. The unions included
employees from Penelec, Penn, CEI, OE and TE, along with certain power plant
employees. On July 8, 2009, FirstEnergy announced that employees of Met-Ed
represented by IBEW Local 777 ratified a two-year contract. Union members had
been working without a contract since the previous agreement expired on
April30, 2009.On December 7, 2009, FirstEnergy announced that
employees of its FGCO subsidiary represented by the IBEW Local 272 voted to
ratify a thirty-nine month labor agreement that runs through February of 2013.
IBEW Local 272 represents 374 of 513 employees at the Bruce Mansfield Plant in
Shippingport, Pennsylvania.
Smart
Grid Proposal
On
August 6, 2009, FirstEnergy filed an application for economic stimulus funding
with the DOE under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that proposed
investing $114million on smart grid technologies to improve the
reliability and interactivity of its electric distribution infrastructure in its
three-state service area. The application requested $57million, which
represents half of the funding needed for targeted projects in communities
served by the Utilities. On October27, 2009, FirstEnergy received notice
from the DOE that its application was selected for award negotiations. However,
no assurance can be given that we will receive such an award. The remaining
investment would be expected to be recovered through customer rates. The project
was approved by the NJBPU on August6, 2009. Approval by the PPUC and the
PUCO for the Pennsylvania portion and the Ohio portion, respectively, of the
project is pending.
Powering
our Communities Program
In
September 2009, FES introduced Powering Our Communities, an innovative program
that offers economic support to communities in the OE, CEI and TE service areas.
The program provides up-front economic support to Ohio residents and businesses
that agree to purchase electric generation supply from FES through governmental
aggregation programs. As of February1, 2010, FES signed agreements with 57
area communities.
In
January 2010, FES, NOPEC and GEXA Energy, NOPEC former generation supplier,
finalized agreements making FES the generation supplier for approximately
425,000 customers in the 160 Northeast Ohio communities served by NOPEC from
January1, 2010 through December31, 2019.
Regulatory
Matters - Ohio
Ohio
Regulatory Update
In
August2009, the PUCO approved the applications to accelerate the recovery
of deferred costs, primarily for distribution investments, from up to 25 years
to 18 months. The principal amount plus carrying charges through August31,
2009, for these deferrals was approximately $305million. Accelerated
recovery began September1, 2009, and will be collected in the 18
non-summer months through May31, 2011, which is expected to save customers
approximately $320 million in carrying costs.

On
December 10, 2009, rules went into effect that set out the manner in which
Ohios electric utilities will be required to comply with benchmarks contained
in SB221 related to the employment of alternative energy resources, energy
efficiency/peak demand reduction programs, greenhouse gas reporting requirements
and changes to long term forecast reporting requirements. The rules restrict the
types of renewable energy resources and energy efficiency and peak reduction
programs that may be included toward meeting the statutory goals, which is
expected to significantly increase the cost of compliance for the Ohio
companies' customers. The Ohio Companies submitted an application to amend their
2009 statutory energy efficiency benchmarks to zero.In January 2010,
the PUCO approved the Ohio Companies request contingent upon their meeting
energy efficiency programs in 2010 2012.
On
December 15, 2009, FirstEnergy Ohio Utilities filed three-year plans with the
PUCO to offer energy efficiency programs to their customers. The filing outlined
specific programs to make homes and businesses more energy efficient and reduce
peak energy use.The PUCO has set the matter for hearing on March 2,
2010.
In
October 2009, the Ohio Companies filed an MRO to procure electric generation for
the period beginning June 1, 2011, that would establish a CBP to secure
generation supply for customers who do not shop with an alternative
supplier.
In late
2009 the Ohio Companies conducted RFPs and secured RECs including solar RECs and
RECs generated in Ohio, in order to meet the Ohio Companies alternative energy
requirements established under SB221 for 2009, 2010 and 2011. As the Ohio
Companies were only able to procure a portion of their solar energy resource
requirements for 2009, on December 7, 2009, they filed an application with the
PUCO seeking approval for a force majeure determination to reduce the 2009 solar
energy resources requirement to the level of the RECs received through the RFPs.
Absent this regulatory relief, the Ohio Companies may not be able to meet their
2009 statutory renewable energy benchmarks, which may result in the assessment
of forfeiture by the PUCO. The PUCO has not yet ruled on that
application.
Regulatory
Matters - Pennsylvania
NUG
Statement Compliance Filing
On March
31, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec submitted their 5-year NUG Statement Compliance
filing to the PPUC. Both Met-Ed and Penelec proposed to reduce their CTC rate
for certain customer classes with a corresponding increase in the generation
rate and shopping credit. While these changes would result in additional annual
generation revenue Met-Ed - $27million and Penelec - $59million,
overall rates would remain unchanged. The PPUC approved the compliance filings
and the reduction in the CTC rate.
By
Tentative Order entered September17, 2009, the PPUC provided for an
additional 30-day comment period on whether the Restructuring Settlement allows
NUG over-collection for select and isolated months to be used to reduce non-NUG
stranded costs when a cumulative NUG stranded cost balance
exists.In response to the Tentative Order, the Office of Small
Business Advocate, Office of Consumer Advocate, York County Solid Waste and
Refuse Authority, and others filed comments objecting to the above accounting
method utilized by Met-Ed and Penelec. After Met-Ed and Penelec filed reply
comments, the PPUC issued a Secretarial Letter on November 5, 2009 allowing
parties to file reply comments to Met-Ed and Penelecs reply comments by
November 16, 2009. Reply comments were filed and the companies are awaiting
further action by the PPUC.
Act
129
In 2009,
the PPUC approved the company-specific energy consumption and peak demand
reductions that must be achieved under Act 129, which requires electric
distribution companies to reduce electricity consumption by 1% by May31,
2011 and by 3% by May31, 2013, and an annual system peak demand reduction
of 45% by May31, 2013. Costs associated with achieving the reduction will
be recovered from customers. On July1, 2009, Met-Ed, Penelec and Penn
filed energy efficiency and conservation plans, which approval is
pending.
Act 129
also required utilities to file with the PPUC a smart meter technology
procurement and installation plan to provide for the installation of smart meter
technology within 15 years. The plan filed by Met-Ed, Penelec, and Penn proposed
a 24-month period to assess their needs, select technology, secure vendors,
train personnel, install and test support equipment, and establish a cost
effective and strategic deployment schedule, which currently is expected to be
completed in 15 years. Met-Ed, Penelec and Penn estimate assessment period costs
at approximately $295 million, which the Pennsylvania Companies proposed to
recover through an automatic adjustment clause. A decision is pending by the
presiding ALJ.
51
Transmission
Cost Recovery
In 2008,
the PPUC approved the Met-Ed and Penelec annual updates to the TSC rider for the
period June1, 2008, through May31, 2009. The TSCs included a
component for under-recovery of actual transmission costs incurred during the
prior period Met-Ed - $144million and Penelec - $4 million and
transmission cost projections for June 2008 through May 2009 Met-Ed 258million and Penelec - $92million. Met-Ed received PPUC approval
for a transition approach that would recover past under-recovered costs plus
carrying charges through future TSCs by December31, 2010. Various
intervenors filed complaints against those filings and the PPUC ordered an
investigation to review the reasonableness of Met-Eds TSC, while allowing
Met-Ed to implement the June1, 2008 rider, subject to refund. In August
2009, the ALJ issued a Recommend Decision to the PPUC approving Met-Eds and
Penelecs TSCs as filed and dismissing all complaints. On January 28, 2010, the
PPUC adopted a motion which denies the recovery of marginal transmission losses
through the TSC for the period of June1, 2007 through March 31, 2008, and
instructs Met-Ed and Penelec to work with the parties and file a petition to
retain any over-collection, with interest, until 2011 for the purpose of
providing mitigation of future rate increases starting in 2011 for their
customers.The Companies are now awaiting an order, which is expected
to be consistent with the motion. If so, Met-Ed and Penelec plan to appeal such
a decision to the Commonwealth Court ofPennsylvania. Although
theultimte outcome ofthis matter cannot be determined at this time,
it is the belief of the Companies that they should prevail in any such appeal
and thereforeexpect to fully recover the approximately $1705 million
$1387million for Met-Ed and $318million for Penelec in marginal
transmission losses for the period prior to January 1, 2011.
On May
28, 2009, the PPUC approved Met-Eds and Penelecs annual updates to their TSC
rider for the period June1, 2009 through May31, 2010, subject to the
outcome of the preceding related to the 2008 TSC filing described above.
Although the new TSC resulted in an approximate 1% decrease in monthly bills for
Penelec customers, the TSC for Met-Eds customers increased to recover the
additional PJM charges paid by Met-Ed in the previous year and to reflect
updated projected costs. Under the proposal, monthly bills for Met-Eds
customers would increase approximately 94% for the period June 2009 through May
2010.
Default
Service Plan
On
February 20, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec filed with the PPUC a generation
procurement plan covering the period January1, 2011 through May31,
2013. A settlement agreement was later filed on all but two issues and on
November 6, 2009, the PPUC entered an Order approving the settlement and finding
in favor of Met-Ed and Penelec on the two issues reserved for litigation.
Generation procurement began in January 2010.
On
February 8, 2010, Penn filed with the PPUC a generation procurement plan
covering the period June 1, 2011 through May31, 2013. The plan is designed
to provide adequate and reliable service via a prudent mix of long-term,
short-term and spot market generation supply, as required by Act129. The
plan proposed a staggered procurement schedule, which varies by customer class,
through the use of a descending clock auction. The PPUC must issue an order on
the plan no later than November 8, 2010.
Regulatory
Matters New Jersey
Solar
Renewable Energy Proposal
On March
27, 2009, the NJBPU approved JCPLs proposal to help increase the pace of
solar energy project development by establishing long-term agreements to
purchase and sell SRECs, which will provide a stable basis for financing solar
generation projects.In 2009, JCPL, in collaboration with
another New Jersey electric utility, announced an RFP to secure
SRECs.A total of 61 MW of solar generating capacity 42 for
JCPL will be solicited to help meet New Jersey Renewable Portfolio
Standards. The first solicitation was conducted in August 2009; subsequent
solicitations will occur over the next three years. The costs of this program
are expected to be fully recoverable through a per KWH rate approved by the
NJBPU and applied to all customers.
On
February 11, 2010, Standard and Poors downgraded the senior unsecured debt of
FirstEnergy Corp. toBB+.As a result, pursuant to the
requirements of a pre-existing NJBPU order, JCPL filed, on February 17, a
plan addressing the mitigation of any effect of the downgrade and which provided
an assessment of present and future liquidity necessary to assure JCPLs
continued payment to BGS suppliers.The order also provides that the
NJBPU should: 1 within 10 days of that filing, hold a public hearing to review
the plan and consider the available options and 2 within 30 days of that filing
issue an order with respect to the matter.At this time, the public
hearing has not been scheduled and FirstEnergy and JCPL cannot determine
the impact, if any, these proceedings will have on their
operations.

FIRSTENERGYS
BUSINESS
We are a
diversified energy company headquartered in Akron, Ohio, that operates primarily
through two core business segments see Results of Operations. Financial
information for each of FirstEnergys reportable segments is presented in the
following table. With the completion of transition to a fully competitive
generation market in Ohio in 2009, the former Ohio Transitional Generation
Services segment was combined with the Energy Delivery Services segment,
consistent with how management views the business. Disclosures for FirstEnergys
operating segments for 2008 and 2007 have been reclassified to conform to the
2009 presentation.
Energy Delivery Services
transmits and distributes electricity through our eight utility operating
companies, serving 45million customers within 36,100 square miles
of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey and purchases power for its PLR and
default service requirements in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Its
revenues are primarily derived from the delivery of electricity within our
service areas, cost recovery of regulatory assets and the sale of electric
generation service to retail customers who have not selected an
alternative supplier default service in its Ohio, Pennsylvania and New
Jersey franchise areas. Its results reflect the commodity costs of
securing electric generation from FES and from non-affiliated power
suppliers, the net PJM and MISO transmission expenses related to the
delivery of the respective generation loads, and the deferral and
amortization of certain fuel costs.
The

Competitive Energy
Services supplies electric power to end-use customers through
retail and wholesale arrangements, including associated company power
sales to meet all or a portion of the PLR and default service requirements
of our Ohio and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries and competitive retail
sales to customers primarily in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Michigan.
This business segment owns or leases and operates 19 generating facilities
with a net demonstrated capacity of 13,710MWs and also purchases
electricity to meet sales obligations. The segment net income is
primarily derived from affiliated and non-affiliated electric generation
sales revenues less the related costs of electricity generation, including
purchased power and net transmission including congestion and ancillary
costs charged by PJM and MISO to deliver energy to the segments
customers.
PROPOSED
MERGER WITH ALLEGHENY
Proposed
Merger with Allegheny Energy, Inc.
On
February 10, 2010, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Allegheny the
consummation of which will result, among other things, in our becoming an
electric utility holding company for:
generation
subsidiaries owning or controlling approximately 24,000 MWs of generating
capacity from a diversified mix of regional coal, nuclear, natural gas,
oil and renewable power,
ten
regulated electric distribution subsidiaries providing electric service to
more than six million customers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, New
Jersey, New York, Virginia and West Virginia, and
transmission
subsidiaries owning over 20,000 miles of high-voltage lines connecting the
Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.
53
Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will
merge with and into Allegheny with Allegheny continuing as the surviving
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy.Pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, upon the closing of the merger, each issued and
outstanding share of Allegheny common stock, including grants of restricted
common stock, will automatically be converted into the right to receive 0667 of
a share of common stock of FirstEnergy. Completion of the merger is
conditioned upon, among other things, shareholder approval of both
companies as well as expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and approval by
the FERC, the Maryland Public Service Commission, PPUC, the Virginia State
Corporation Commission and the West Virginia Public Service Commission. We
anticipate that the necessary approvals will be obtained within 12 to 14 months.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and
Allegheny, and further provides for the payment of fees and expenses upon
termination under specified circumstances. Further information concerning the
proposed merger will be included in a joint proxy statement/prospectus contained
in the registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed by us with the SEC in
connection with the merger.
Prior
to the merger, we and Allegheny will continue to operate as separate companies.
Accordingly, except for specific references to the pending merger, the
descriptions of our strategy and outlook and the risks and challenges we face,
and the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial
condition set forth below relate solely to FirstEnergy.Details
regarding the pending merger are discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated
financial statements.
STRATEGY
AND OUTLOOK
We
continue to focus on the primary objectives we have developed that support our
business fundamentals safety, generation, reliability, transitioning to
competitive markets, managing our liquidity, and growing earnings. To achieve
these objectives, we are pursuing the following strategies:
strengthening
our safety focus;
maximizing
the utilization of our generating
fleet;
meeting
our transmission and distribution reliability
goals;
managing
the transition to competitive generation market prices in Ohio and
Pennsylvania;
executing
our direct-to-customer retail sales
strategy;
maintaining
adequate and ready access to cash resources;
and
achieving
our financial goals and commitments to
shareholders.
2009 was
a difficult year for the U.S. economy due to the ongoing effects of the
recession. In the region FirstEnergy serves, this was evidenced by reduced
sales, particularly in the industrial sector, and very soft wholesale market
power prices when compared to 2008. We responded, in part, by making adjustments
to both our operational and capital spending plans, as well as our financing
plans. Despite these challenges, we continued to make solid progress toward
achieving our overall operational and financial goals.
We began
implementation of our long-term strategic plans during the past several years.
Our gradual progression to competitive generation markets across our tri-state
service territory and other strategies to improve performance and deliver
consistent financial results is characterized by several important transition
periods:
2007
and 2008
In 2007,
we successfully transitioned Penn to market-based retail rates for generation
service through a competitive, wholesale power supply procurement process.
During 2007 we also completed comprehensive rate cases for Met-Ed and Penelec,
which better aligned their transmission and distribution rates with their rate
base and costs to serve customers. For generation service, Met-Ed and Penelec
received partial requirements for their PLR service from FES. Also during 2007,
the Ohio Companies filed an application for an increase in electric distribution
rates with the PUCO to support a distribution rate increase. In 2009, the PUCO
granted the Ohio Companies' application to increase electric distribution rates
by $1366million. These increases went into effect during
2009.
We
continued our successful mining our assets program, through which we increased
the net-generating capacity at several facilities through cost-effective unit
upgrades. In 2008, we achieved record generation output of 824billion
KWH. Our generation growth strategy is to continue to implement low cost,
incremental upgrades to existing facilities, complemented by strategic asset
purchases, rather than making substantial investments in new coal or nuclear
baseload capacity with very long lead times to construct.
We made
several strategic investments in 2008, including the purchase of the partially
complete Fremont Energy Center, which includes two natural gas combined-cycle
combustion turbines and a steam turbine capable of producing 544 MW of
load-following capacity and 163 MW of peaking capacity. We expect to complete
construction by the end of 2010.
54
In
mid-2008, we also entered into a joint venture to acquire a majority stake in
the Signal Peak coal mining project. As part of that transaction, we also
entered into a 15-year agreement to purchase up to 10 million tons of coal
annually from the mine, securing a long-term western fuel supply at attractive
prices. The higher Btu content of Signal Peak coal versus Powder River Basin
coal is expected to help avoid fossil plant derates of approximately 170MW
and help support our incremental generation expansion plans. The burning of
Signal Peak coal is also expected to improve the performance of some of our
older generating units, which will factor into our decision making process
regarding potential future plant shutdowns. Signal Peak began commercial
operation in December 2009. Although, we have experienced some issues with the
start-up of commercial operations, we believe those issues will be resolved and
Signal Peak is expected to achieve its production goals for the
year.In the fourth quarter of 2008, FES assigned two existing Powder
River Basin contracts to a third party in order to reduce its forecasted 2010
long coal position as a result of expected deliveries from Signal
Peak.
In July
2008, we filed both a comprehensive ESP and MRO with the PUCO. In November 2008,
the PUCO issued an order denying the MRO. In December 2008, the PUCO approved,
but substantially modified, our ESP. After determining that the plan no longer
maintained a reasonable balance between providing customers with continued rate
stability and a fair return on the Ohio Companies investments to serve
customers, we withdrew our application for the ESP as allowed by law see
Regulatory Matters Ohio.
2009
and 2010
In 2009,
our total generation output of 659 billion KWH reflected the economic realities
of the continued recession coupled with mild weather, particularly during the
summer months. Due to the continued implementation of our retail strategy, which
will concentrate on direct sales and governmental aggregation and de-emphasize
the wholesale market, we expect a significant increase in our generation output
in 2010. Distribution rate increases became effective for OE and TE in January
2009 and for CEI in May 2009, as a result of rate cases filed in 2007.
Transition cost recovery related to the Ohio Companies transition to a
competitive generation market ended for OE and TE on December31, 2008.
Additionally, FES assumed their third party partial requirements contracts and
now expects to provide Met-Ed and Penelec with their complete PLR and default
service load through the end of 2010 when their current rate caps expire and
they transition to procuring their generation requirements at competitive market
prices.
On
February 19, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed an amended ESP application,
including a Stipulation and Recommendation that was signed by the Ohio
Companies, the Staff of the PUCO, and many of the intervening parties
representing a diverse range of interests and on February 26, 2009 filed a
Supplemental Stipulation supported by nearly every party in the case, which the
PUCO approved in March 2009 see Regulatory Matters Ohio. The Amended ESP
included a May 2009 auction to secure full requirements generation supply and
pricing for the Ohio Companies for the period June1, 2009 through
May31, 2011. The auction resulted in an average weighted wholesale price
for generation and transmission of 615 cents per KWH. FES was a successful
bidder for 51% of the Ohio Companies PLR load.
Following
the May 2009 auction, FES accelerated the execution of its retail strategy,
described above, to directly acquire and serve customers of the Ohio Companies,
including select large commercial and industrial customers. Through
December31, 2009, FES entered into agreements with 60 area communities
under governmental aggregation programs, representing approximately 580,000
residential and small commercial customers inside of our Ohio franchise
territories.As of December31, 2009, FES supplied 77% of the
PLR load.
In
August 2009, we filed an application with the FERC for approval to consolidate
our ATSI transmission assets and operations currently dedicated to MISO into
PJM. On December17, 2009, FERC issued an order approving the integration
and outlining the terms required for the move, which is expected to be complete
by June1, 2011. On December18, 2009, ATSI announced it had signed an
agreement to join PJM. In December 2009, we also announced that an agreement in
principle had been reached to sell the 340-MW Sumpter Plant which is located in
MISO. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2010.
Total
distribution sales in 2009 were 102 million MWH, down from 112 million MWH in
2008. This decrease was due to the effects of the recession, primarily in
reduced industrial sales, coupled with mild weather.
As we
look to 2010 and beyond, we expect to continue our focus on operational
excellence with an emphasis on continuous improvement in our core businesses to
position for success during the next phase of the market recovery. This includes
ongoing incremental investment in projects to increase our generation capacity
and energy production capability as well as programs to continue to improve
transmission and distribution system reliability and customer
service.
55
2011
and Beyond
Another
major transition period for FirstEnergy will begin in 2011 as the current cap on
Met-Eds and Penelecs retail generation rates is expected to expire. Beginning
in 2011, Met-Ed and Penelec have approval from the PPUC to obtain their power
supply from the competitive wholesale market and fully recover their generation
costs through retail rates. As a result, FES plans to redeploy the power
currently sold to Met-Ed and Penelec primarily to retail customers located in
and near our generation footprint and into local regional auctions and RFPs for
PLR service, with the remainder available for sale in the wholesale
market.
In Ohio,
we filed an application for an MRO with the PUCO in October 2009, which would
establish generation rates for the Ohio Companies beginning June1, 2011,
using a descending clock-style auction similar in all material respects to that
used in the May 2009 auction process.Pursuant to SB221, the PUCO has 90
days from the date of the application to determine whether the MRO meets certain
statutory requirements. Although the Ohio Companies requested a PUCO
determination by January18, 2010, on February 3, 2010, the PUCO announced
that its determination would be delayed. Under a determination that such
statutory requirements are met, the Ohio Companies would be able to implement
the MRO and conduct the CBP.
We will
continue our efforts to extract additional production capability from existing
generating plants as discussed under Capital Expenditures Outlook below and
maintain the financial and strategic flexibility necessary to thrive in the
competitive marketplace.
As
discussed above, our strategy is focused on maximizing the earnings potential
from our unregulated FES operations and maintaining stable earnings growth from
our regulated utility operations. In
addition, if approvals for the pending merger with Allegheny have been obtained
and the merger is consummated in early to mid-2011 as we currently expect, the
work of integrating Allegheny and its operations and generation, transmission
and distribution assets with our own will begin in earnest.We expect
that those efforts will enhance our ability to achieve our strategic goals as
discussed above. 
Financial
Outlook
In
response to the unprecedented volatility in the capital and credit markets that
began in late 2008 and our increased risk exposure to the commodity markets that
resulted from the outcome of the Ohio CBP, we carefully assessed our exposure to
counterparty credit risk, our access to funds in the capital and credit markets,
and market-related changes in the value of our postretirement benefit trusts,
nuclear decommissioning trusts and other investments. We have takensteps
to strengthen our liquidity position and provide additional flexibility to meet
our anticipated obligations and those of our subsidiaries.
These
actions included spending reductions of more than $600million in 2009
compared to 2008 levels through measured and appropriate changes in capital and
operation and maintenance expenditures.In addition, we adjusted the
construction schedule for the $18billion AQC project at our W.H. Sammis
Plant in order to delay certain costs from our 2009 budget while still targeting
our completion deadline by the end of 2010.
We
completed significant financing activities at our regulated utilities of $22
billion as well as issuing 5, 12 and 30-year unsecured senior notes totaling
$15 billion at FES. We also completed refinancing $518 million of variable rate
debt to fixed rate debt, and made a voluntary contribution of $500million
in September 2009 to our pension plan. 2009 cash flow from operations was strong
at $25 billion
On
February 11, 2010, SP issued a report lowering FirstEnergys and its
subsidiaries credit ratings by one notch, while maintaining its stable outlook.
As a result, FirstEnergy may be required to post up to $48 million of collateral
see Note15B.Moody and Fitch affirmed the ratings and
stable outlook of FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries on February 11,
2010.
Our
financial strategy focuses on reducing debt, a minimum of $500million
during 2010.We are also focusing on delivering consistent financial
results, improving financial strength and flexibility, deploying cash as
effectively as possible, andimproving our currentcredit
metrics.
Positive
earnings drivers in 2010 are expected to include:
Increased
FES commodity margin from implementation of the retail strategy and the
restructuring of the PJM PLR
contracts;
Increased
distribution revenues from projected sales of 110 million MWH in 2010 vs.
102 million MWH in 2009, and a full year of both the distribution rate
increase and Delivery Service Improvement Rider in
Ohio;
56
A
full year of operation and maintenance cost savings that resulted from
2009 staffing adjustments, changes in our compensation structure, fossil
plant outage schedule changes and general cost-saving measures;
and
Reduced
costs from one less nuclear refueling outage in 2010 vs.
2009.
Negative
earnings driversin
2010 are expected to include:
Reduced
gains from sale of nuclear decommissioning trust investments in
2009;
Reduced
RTC margin for CEI:
The
absence of significant favorable tax settlements in 2010 compared to 2009;
and
Increased
benefit and financing costs, general taxes and depreciation
expense.
Our liquidity position remains strong,
with access to more than $33billion of liquidity, of which
approximately $25billion was available as of January31, 2010. We
intend to continue to fund our capital requirements through cash generated from
operations.
A driver
for longer-term earnings growth is our continued effort to improve the
utilization and output of our generation fleet. During 2010 we plan to invest
approximately $646million in our regulated energy delivery services
business
Positive
earnings drivers for 2011 could include:
The
December 31, 2010 expiration of FES contracts to serve Met-Ed and
Penelecs generation requirements. In 2011, 100% of the generation output
at FES will be priced at market;
Potentially
increased distribution deliveries tied to an economic recovery;
and
Incremental
Signal Peak coal production and price
improvement
Negative
earnings drivers for 2011 could include:
Increased
nuclear fuel costs and coal contract pricing
adjustments;
Pressure
to maintain OM cost reductions vs. 2010 with a potentially improving
economy
Increased
depreciation and general taxes and lower capitalized interest resulting
from completion of our Sammis AQC and Fremont construction
projects
Capital
Expenditures Outlook
Our
capital expenditure forecast for 2010 is approximately $165
billion.
Capital
expenditures for our competitive energy services business are expected to hold
steady from 2009 to 2010 at$467million exclusive of Sammis AQC
project, the Burger Biomass conversion and Norton, and the Fremont facility.
That level spending plan includes $65 million for the Davis-Besse steam
generator replacement, expected to be completed in 2014. Other planned
expenditures provide for maintaining of critical generation assets, delivering
operational improvements to enhance reliability, and supporting our generation
to market strategy.
This is
the final year for work on the Sammis AQC project, which is expected to go in
service at the end of 2010.To date, this
initiative has cost just under $158 billion, with an additional $241 million
planned in 2010. Expenditures on the Burger Biomass conversion project get
underway in 2010 with $16 million planned. The project is expected to be
completed by December 2012. We plan to spend $150 million in 2010 on the Fremont
facility and anticipate that work will be completed by the end of the
year.
For our
regulated operations, capital expenditures are forecast to be $646 million in
2010, primarily in support of transmission and distribution reliability. The
spending plan also includes projects in Ohio and Pennsylvania for Energy
Efficiency and Advanced Metering initiatives, which are expected to be partially
reimbursed through federal stimulus funding.
57
The
anticipated 2010 capital spend for the Regional Transmission Expansion
initiative is $78 million. This initiative is focused on meeting NERC,
Reliability First Corporation, PJM and FirstEnergy planning criteria. In
addition, there are projects associated with the connection of new retail and
wholesale load delivery points, transition to PJM market, and projects
connecting new wholesale generation connection points.
For 2011
through 2014, we anticipate average annual capital expenditures of approximately
$12 billion, exclusive of any additional opportunities or new mandated
spending. Planned capital initiatives promote reliability, improve operations,
and support current environmental and energy efficiency proposals.

Environmental
Outlook
At
FirstEnergy, we continually strive to enhance environmental protection and
remain good stewards of our natural resources. We allocate significant resources
to support our environmental compliance efforts, and our employees share both a
commitment to and accountability for our environmental performance. Our
corporate focus on continuous improvement is integral to our environmental
performance.
Recent
action underscores our commitment to enhancing our environmental stewardship
throughout our entire organization as well as mitigating the companys exposure
to existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations.
In
April, 2009, we announced our intention to convert our R.E. Burger Plant in
Shadyside, Ohio from a facility that generates electricity by burning coal to
one that will utilize renewable biomass. When completed, Burger will be one of
the largest renewable facilities of its kind in the world. In September 2009, we
announced plans to complete construction of the Fremont Energy Center, a 707-MW
natural-gas fired peaking plant located in Fremont, Ohio, by the end of 2010.
And in November 2009, we purchased the rights to develop a compressed-air
electric generating plant in Norton, Ohio. This technology would essentially
operate like a large battery with the ability to store energy when there is low
demand and then use it when needed. This is especially important for the storage
of energy generated from intermittent renewable sources of energy such as wind
and solar as they do not always produce energy when demand is high. Together,
these three low-emitting projects Burger, Fremont, and Norton are part of our
overall environmental strategy, which includes continued investment in renewable
and low-emitting energy resources.
We have
spent more than $7 billion on environmental protection efforts since the Clean
Air Act became law in 1970, and these investments are making a difference. Since
1990, we have reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides NOx by more than 72% sulfur
dioxide SO2 by more than 69% and mercury by about 47%.Also, our
CO2 emission rate, in pounds of CO2 per kWh, has dropped by 19 percent through
this period. Based on this progress, emission rates for our power plants are
significantly lower than the regional average.
To
further enhance our environmental performance, we have implemented our AQC plan.
The plan includes projects designed to ensure that all of the facilities in our
generation fleet are operated in compliance with all applicable emissions
standards and limits, including NOx SO2 and particulate. It also fulfills the
requirements imposed by the 2005 Sammis Consent Decree that resolved Sammis NSR
litigation. At the end of 2010, we will have invested approximately $18 billion
at our W.H. Sammis Plant in Stratton, Ohio, to further reduce emissions of SO2
and NOx. This multi-year environmental retrofit project, which began in 2006 and
is expected to be completed in 2010, is designed to reduce the plants SO2
emissions by 95% and NOx by at least 64%. This is one of the largest
environmental retrofit projects in the nation.
58
By
yearend, we expect approximately 70% of our generation fleet to be non emitting
or low emitting generation.Over 52% of our coal-fired generating
fleet will have full NOx and SO2 equipment controls thus significantly
decreasing our exposure to the volatile emission allowance market for NOx and
SO2 and potential future environmental requirements.
One of
the key issues facing our company and industry is global climate change related
mandates. Lawmakers at the state and federal level are exploring and
implementing a wide range of responses. We believe our generation fleet is very
well positioned to be successfully competitive in a carbon-constrained
economy.In addition, we believe the proposed merger with Allegheny,
if consummated, will enhance our environmental profile as it will result in our
having an even more diverse mix of fully-scrubbed baseload fossil, non-emitting
nuclear and renewable generation, including large-scale storage.
We have
taken aggressive steps over the past two decades that have increased our
generating capacity without adding to overall CO2 emissions. For example, since
1990, we have reconfigured our fleet by retiring nearly 700 megawatts of older,
coal-based generation and adding more than 1,800 megawatts of non-emitting
nuclear capacity. Through these and other actions, we have increased our
generating capacity by nearly 15% over the same period while avoiding some 350
million metric tons of CO2 emissions. Today, nearly 40% of our electricity is
generated without emitting CO2 a key advantage that will help us meet the
challenge of future government climate change mandates. And with recent
announcements in 2009, including the expanded use of renewable energy, energy
storage and natural gas, our CO2 emission rate will decline even further in the
future.
Moreover,
we have taken a leadership role in pursuing new ventures and testing and
developing new technologies that show promise in achieving additional reductions
in CO2 emissions. These include:
Bringing
online 1325 MW of wind generation in 2009 and we now sell over 1 million
MWh per year of wind generation.
Testing
of CO2 sequestration at our R.E. Burger Plant. The results of this testing
will help us gain a better understanding of the potential for geological
storage of CO2.
Supporting
afforestation growing forests
on non-forested land and other efforts designed to remove CO2 from the
environment.
Participating
in the U.S. EPAs SF6 sulfur hexafluoride Emissions Reduction
Partnership for Electric Power Systems since its inception in
1998.Since then, we have reduced emissions of SF6 by nearly 20
metric tons, resulting in an equivalent reduction of nearly 430,000 tons
of CO2.
Supporting
research to develop and evaluate cost effective sorbent materials for CO2
capture including work by Powerspan at the Burger Plant and the University
of Akron.
In
addition, we will remain actively engaged in the federal and state debate over
future environmental requirements and legislation, especially those dealing with
global climate change. We are committed to working with policy makers to develop
fair and reasonable legislation, with the goal of reducing global emissions
while minimizing the economic impact on our customers.Due to the
significant uncertainty as to the final form of any such legislation at both the
federal and state levels, it makes it difficult to determine the potential
impact and risks associated with GHG emissions requirements.
We also
have a long history of supporting research in distributed energy
resources.Distributed energy resources include fuel cells, solar and
wind systems or energy storage technologies located close to the customer or
direct control of customer loads to provide alternatives or enhancements to the
traditional electric power system. Through a partnership with EPRI, the Cuyahoga
Valley National Park, the Department of Defense and Case Western Reserve
University, two solid-oxide fuel cells were installed as part of a test program
to explore the technology and the environmental benefits of distributed
generation. We are also evaluating the impact of distributed energy storage on
the distribution system through analysis and field demonstrations of advanced
battery technologies. Integrated direct load control technology with two-way
communication capability is being installed on customers non-critical equipment
such as air conditioners in New Jersey and Pennsylvania to help manage peak
loading on the electric distribution system.
We are
equally committed internally to environmental performance throughout our entire
organization, including our newest facility, a green office building in Akron
that incorporates a wide range of innovative, environmentally sound features
pictured below.In December, this building was awarded Gold Level
certification by the U.S. Green Building Councils Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design LEED program, making this campus the largest office
building in northeast Ohio to receive this highly-prized
designation.
59
Our
efforts to protect the environment combine innovative technologies with proven
and effective work processes. For example, we are expanding an environmental
management system that tracks thousands of environmental commitments and
provides up-to-date information to responsible parties on compliance issues and
deadlines. This system allows us to more efficiently maintain our compliance
with environmental standards.
The
company also uses a rigorous compliance assistance program. Company personnel
continually audit all of our facilities, from generating plants to office
buildings, and conduct a top-to-bottom review of the entire operation to check
on compliance with company environmental policy and environmental regulation in
addition to identifying best environmental practices.
Achieving
Our Vision
Our
success in these and other key areas will help us continue to achieve our vision
of being a leading regional energy provider, recognized for operational
excellence, outstanding customer service and our commitment to safety; the
choice for long-term growth, investment value and financial strength; and a
company driven by the leadership, skills, diversity and character of our
employees.

restrict or control such rate increases; this in turn could create
uncertainty affecting planning, costs and results of operations and may
adversely affect the utilities ability to recover their costs, maintain
adequate liquidity and address capital
requirements;
our
profitability is impacted by our affiliated companies continued
authorization to sell power at market-based
rates;
there
are uncertainties relating to our participation in regional transmission
organizations;

The
lower revenues from distribution services were driven primarily by the
reductions in sales volume associated with milder weather and economic
conditions. The decrease in residential deliveries reflected reduced
weather-related usage compared to 2008, as cooling degree days and heating
degree days decreased by 17% and 1%, respectively. The decreases in distribution
deliveries to commercial and industrial customers were primarily due to economic
conditions in FirstEnergy service territory. In the industrial sector, KWH
deliveries declined to major automotive customers by 202% and to steel
customers by 362%. Reduced revenues from transition charges for OE and TE that
ceased with the full recovery of related costs effective January1, 2009
and the transition rate reduction for CEI effective June 1, 2009, were offset by
PUCO-approved distribution rate increases see Regulatory Matters 
Ohio.

The
decrease in retail generation sales volumes from 2008 was primarily due to the
weakened economic conditions and milder weather described above. Retail
generation prices increased for JCPL and Penn during 2009 as a result of
their power procurement processes. For the Ohio Companies, average prices
increased primarily due to the higher fuel cost recovery riders that were
effective from January through May 2009. In addition, effective June 1, 2009,
the Ohio Companies transmission tariff ended and the recovery of transmission
costs is included in the generation rate established under the CBP.
65
Wholesale
generation sales decreased principally as a result of JCPL selling less
available power from NUGs due to the termination of a NUG purchase contract in
October 2008. The decrease in wholesale prices reflected lower spot market
prices in PJM.

revenues decreased $245million primarily due to the termination of the
Ohio Companies current transmission tariff and lower MISO and PJM transmission
revenues, partially offset by higher transmission rates for Met-Ed and Penelec
resulting from the annual updates to their TSC riders see Regulatory Matters.
The difference between transmission revenues accrued and transmission costs
incurred are deferred, resulting in no material effect on current period
earnings.
Expenses
Total
expenses increased by $215million due to the following:
Purchased
power costs were $80million higher in
2009 due to higher unit costs, partially offset by an increase in volumes
combined with higher NUG cost deferrals. The increased purchased power
costs from non-affiliates was due primarily to increased volumes for the
Ohio Companies as a result of their CBP, partially offset by lower volumes
for Met-Ed and Penelec due to the termination of a third-party supply
contract in December 2008 and for JCPL due to the termination of a
NUG purchase contract in October 2008. Decreased purchased power costs
from FES were principally due to lower volumes for the Ohio Companies
following their CBP, partially offset by increased volumes for Met-Ed and
Penelec under their fixed-price partial requirements PSA with FES. Higher
unit costs from FES, which included a component for transmission under the
Ohio Companies CBP, partially offset the decreased
volumes.

Transmission
expenses were lower by $481 million in 2009, reflecting the change in the
transmission tariff under the Ohio Companies' CBP, reduced transmission
volumes and lower congestion costs.
Intersegment
cost reimbursements related to the Ohio Companies nuclear generation
leasehold interests increased by $114 million in 2009.Prior to
2009, a portion of OEs and TEs leasehold costs were recovered through
customer transition charges.Effective January 1, 2009, these
leasehold costs are reimbursed from the competitive energy services
segment.
Labor
and employee benefit expenses decreased by $39million reflecting
changes to Energy Delivery organizational and compensation structure and
increased resources dedicated to capital projects, partially offset by
higher pension expenses resulting from reduced pension plan asset values
at the end of 2008.
Storm-related
costs were $16 million lower in 2009 compared to the prior
year.
An
increase in other operating expenses of $40million resulted from the
recognition of economic development and energy efficiency obligations in
accordance with the PUCO-approved
ESP.
Uncollectible
expenses were higher by $12 million in 2009 principally due to increased
bankruptcies.
A
$102 million increase in the amortization of regulatory assets was due
primarily to the ESP-related impairment of CEIs regulatory assets $216
million and MISO/PJM transmission cost amortization in 2009, partially
offset by the cessation of transition cost amortization for OE and
TE.
66
A
$180 million decrease in the deferral of new regulatory assets was
principally due to the absence in 2009 of PJM transmission cost deferrals
and RCP distribution cost deferrals, partially offset by the PUCO-approved
deferral of purchased power costs for
CEI.
Depreciation
expense increased $28million due to property additions since
2008.
General
taxes decreased $5million due primarily to lower revenue-related
taxes in 2009.
Other
Expense 
Other
expense increased $93million in 2009 compared to 2008. Lower investment
income of $32million resulted primarily from repaid notes receivable from
affiliates. Higher interest expense net of capitalized interest of $61million resulted from a
net increase in debt of $18billion by the Utilities and ATSI during
2009.
Competitive
Energy Services 2009 Compared to 2008
Net
income increased to $517 million in 2009 compared to $472 million in the same
period of 2008. The increase in net income includes FGCO gain from the sale of
a 9% participation interest in OVEC, increased sales margins, and an increase in
investment income, offset by a mark-to-market adjustment relating to purchased
power contracts for delivery in 2010 and 2011.
Revenues
Total
revenues increased $192million in 2009 compared to the same period in
2008. This increase primarily resulted from the OVEC sale and higher unit prices
on affiliated generation sales to the Ohio Companies and non-affiliated
customers, partially offset by lower sales volumes.
The
increase in reported segment revenues resulted from the following

The
increase in non-affiliated retail revenues of $163 million resulted from
increased revenue in both the PJM and MISO markets. The increase in MISO retail
revenue is primarily the result of the acquisition of new customers, higher unit
prices and the inclusion of the transmission related component in retail rates
previously reported as transmission revenues. The increase in PJM retail revenue
resulted from the acquisition of new customers, higher sales volumes and unit
prices. The acquisition of new customers in MISO is primarily due to new
government aggregation contracts with 60 area communities in Ohio that will
provide discounted generation prices to approximately 580,000 residential and
small commercial customers. Lower non-affiliated wholesale revenues of $49
million resulted from decreased sales volumes in PJM partially offset by
increased capacity prices, increased sales volumes in MISO, and favorable
settlements on hedged transactions.
The
lower affiliated company wholesale generation revenues of $125million were
due to lower sales volumes to the Ohio Companies combined with lower unit prices
to the Pennsylvania companies, partially offset by higher unit prices to the
Ohio Companies and increased sales volumes to the Pennsylvania Companies. The
lower sales volumes and higher unit prices to the Ohio Companies reflected the
results of the power procurement processes in the first half of 2009 see
Regulatory Matters Ohio. The higher sales to the Pennsylvania Companies were
due to increased Met-Ed and Penelec generation sales requirements supplied by
FES partially offset by lower sales to Penn due to decreased default service
requirements in 2009 compared to 2008. Additionally, while unit prices for each
of the Pennsylvania Companies did not change, the mix of sales among the
companies caused the overall price to decline.

Transmission
revenues decreased $77 million due primarily to reduced loads following the
expiration of the government aggregation programs in Ohio at the end of 2008 and
to the inclusion of the transmission-related component in the retail rates in
mid-2009. In 2009 FGCO sold 9% of its participation interest in OVEC resulting
in a $252 million $158 million, after tax gain. Other revenue increased
$28million primarily due to income associated with NGC acquisition of
equity interests in the Perry and Beaver Valley Unit 2 leases.
Expenses
- -
Total
expenses increased $273million in 2009 due to the following
factors:
Fossil
Fuel costs decreased $198million due primarily to lower generation
volumes $307million partially offset by higher unit prices
$109million. Nuclear Fuel costs increased $13million as
higher unit prices $26million were partially offset by lower
generation $13million.
Purchased
power costs increased $217million due to a mark-to-market adjustment
$205million relating to purchased power contracts for delivery in
2010 and 2011 and higher unit prices $33million that resulted
primarily from higher capacity costs, partially offset by lower volumes
purchased $21 million due to FGCO reduced participation interest in
OVEC.
Fossil
operating costs decreased $24million due primarily to a reduction in
contractor, material and labor costs and increased resources dedicated to
capital projects, partially offset by higher employee
benefits.
Nuclear
operating costs increased $45 million due to an additional refueling
outage during the 2009 period and higher employee benefits, partially
offset by lower labor costs.
Transmission
expense increased $121 million due to transmission services charges
related to the load serving entity obligations in MISO, increased net
congestion and higher loss expenses in MISO and
PJM.
Other
expense increased $72 million due primarily to increased intersegment
billings for leasehold costs from the Ohio Companies and higher pension
costs.
Depreciation
expense increased $27million due to NGC increased ownership
interest in Beaver Valley Unit2 and
Perry.
68
Other
Income Expense 
Total
other income in 2009 was $15million compared to
total other expense in 2008 of $142million, resulting primarily from a
$155million increase from gains on the sale of nuclear decommissioning
trust investments. During 2009, the majority of the nuclear decommissioning
trust holdings were converted to more closely align with the liability being
funded.
Other
2009 Compared to 2008
Our
financial results from other operating segments and reconciling items resulted
in a $100million increase in net income in 2009 compared to 2008. The
increase resulted primarily from $200million of favorable tax settlements,
offset by debt redemption costs of $90million and by the absence of the
gain from the sale of telecommunication assets $19million, net of taxes
in 2008.

decreased by 146%; heating degree days increased by 25%. In the industrial
sector, a decrease in deliveries to automotive customers 18% and steel
customers 4% was partially offset by an increase in usage by refining
customers 3%.

The
decrease in retail generation sales volumes was primarily due to milder weather
and economic conditions in the Utilities' service territories and an increase in
customer shopping for Penn, Penelec and JCPL. The increase in retail
generation prices in 2008 was due to higher generation rates for JCPL
resulting from the New Jersey BGS auctions effective June1, 2007 and
June1, 2008, and the Ohio Companies' fuel cost recovery riders that became
effective in January 2008. The increase in wholesale prices reflected higher
spot market prices for PJM market participants.
Transmission
revenues increased $149million due to higher transmission rates for Met-Ed
and Penelec resulting from the annual update to their TSC riders in mid-2008 and
the Ohio Companies' PUCO-approved transmission tariff increases that became
effective July1, 2007 and July1, 2008. The difference between
transmission revenues accrued and transmission expenses incurred is deferred,
resulting in no material impact to current period earnings.
71
Expenses
The net
revenue increase discussed above was more than offset by a $795million
increase in expenses due to the following:
Purchased
power costs were $507million higher in
2008 due to higher unit costs and a decrease in the amount of NUG costs
deferred. The increase in unit costs from non-affiliates was primarily due
to higher costs for JCPL resulting from the BGS auction process.
JCPL is permitted to defer for future collection from customers the
amounts by which its costs of supplying BGS to non-shopping customers and
costs incurred under NUG agreements exceed amounts collected through BGS
and NUGC rates and market sales of NUG energy and capacity. Higher unit
costs from FES reflect the increases in the Ohio Companies' retail
generation rates, as provided for under the PSA then in effect with FES.
The decrease in purchase volumes was due to the lower retail generation
sales requirements described above.

Other
operating expenses increased $17million due
primarily to the net effect of the
following:
-
a
$69 million increase primarily for reduced intersegment credits associated
with the Ohio Companies' nuclear generation leasehold interests and
increased MISO transmission-related
expenses;
-
a
$15million
decrease for contractor costs associated with vegetation management
activities, as more of that work performed in 2008 related to capital
projects;
-
a
$13million decrease in uncollectible expense due primarily to the
recognition of higher uncollectible reserves in 2007 and enhanced
collection processes in 2008;
-
lower
labor costs charged to operating expense of $12million, as a greater
proportion of labor was devoted to capital-related projects in 2008;
and
-
a
$6million decline in regulatory program costs, including customer
rebates.
Amortization
of regulatory assets increased $34million due primarily to higher
transition cost amortization for the Ohio Companies, partially offset by
decreases at JCPL for regulatory assets that were fully recovered at
the end of 2007 and in the first half of
2008.
The
deferral of new regulatory assets during 2008 was $208million lower
than in 2007. MISO transmission deferrals and RCP fuel deferrals decreased
$166 million, as more transmission and generation costs were recovered
from customers through PUCO-approved riders. Also contributing to the
decrease was the absence of the one-time deferral in 2007 of
decommissioning costs related to the Saxton nuclear research facility
$27million and lower PJM transmission cost deferrals $32
million, partially offset by increased societal benefit deferrals
$15million.
Higher
depreciation expense of $13million resulted from additional capital
projects placed in service since
2007.
General
taxes increased $19million due to higher gross receipts taxes,
property taxes and payroll taxes.
72
Other
Expense 
Other
expense increased $32million in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower
investment income of $70million, resulting
primarily from the repayment of notes receivable from affiliates, partially
offset by lower interest expense net of capitalized interest of
$38million. The interest expense declined for the Ohio Companies due to
their redemption of certain pollution control notes in the second half of
2007.
Competitive
Energy Services 2008 Compared to 2007
Net
income for this segment was $472million in 2008 compared to
$495million in 2007. The $23million reduction in net income reflects
a decrease in gross generation margin revenue less fuel and purchased power
and higher depreciation expense, which were partially offset by lower other
operating expenses.
Revenues
Total
revenues increased $170million in 2008 compared
to 2007. This increase primarily resulted from higher unit prices on affiliated
generation sales to the Ohio Companies and increased non-affiliated wholesale
sales, partially offset by lower retail sales.

The
lower retail revenues reflect reduced commercial and industrial contract
renewals in the PJM market and the termination of certain government aggregation
programs in MISO. Higher non-affiliated wholesale revenues resulted from higher
capacity prices and increased sales volumes in PJM, partially offset by
decreased sales volumes in MISO.
The
increased affiliated company generation revenues were due to higher unit prices
for the Ohio Companies partially offset by lower unit prices for the
Pennsylvania Companies and decreased affiliated sales volumes. The higher unit
prices reflected fuel-related increases in the Ohio Companies retail generation
rates. While unit prices for each of the Pennsylvania Companies did not change,
the mix of sales among the companies caused the overall price to decline. The
reduction in PSA sales volumes to the Ohio and Pennsylvania Companies was due to
the milder weather and industrial sales changes discussed above and reduced
default service requirements in Penns service territory as a result of its RFP
process.

Transmission
revenues increased $47million due primarily to higher transmission rates

Expenses
Total
expenses increased $203million in 2008 due to the following
factors:
Fossil
fuel costs increased $155million due to higher unit prices
$163million partially offset by lower generation volume
$8million. The increased unit prices primarily reflect increased
rates for existing eastern coal contracts, higher transportation
surcharges and emission allowance costs in 2008. Nuclear fuel expense was
$10million higher as nuclear generation increased in
2008.
Purchased
power costs increased $15million due primarily to higher spot market
and capacity prices, partially offset by reduced volume
requirements.
Fossil
operating costs decreased $22million due to a gain on the sale of a
coal contract in the fourth quarter of 2008 $20million, reduced
scheduled outage activity $17million and increased gains from
emission allowance sales $7million, partially offset by costs
associated with a cancelled electro-catalytic oxidation project
$13million and a $7million increase in labor
costs.
Transmission
expense decreased $35 million due to reduced congestion
costs.
Other
operating costs increased $39million due primarily to the assignment
of CEIs and TEs leasehold interests in the Bruce Mansfield Plant to FGCO
in the fourth quarter of 2007 $31million and reduced life
insurance investment values, partially offset by lower associated company
billings and employee benefit
costs.
Higher
depreciation expenses of $39million were due to the assignment of
the Bruce Mansfield Plant leasehold interests to FGCO and NGCs purchase
of certain lessor equity interests in Perry and Beaver Valley Unit
2.
Other
Expense 
Total
other expense in 2008 was $6million higher than in
2007, principally due to a $50million decrease in net earnings from
nuclear decommissioning trust investments due primarily to securities
impairments resulting from market declines during 2008, partially offset by a
decline in interest expense net of capitalized interest of $44million
from the repayment of notes to affiliates since 2007.
Other
2008 Compared to 2007
Our
financial results from other operating segments and reconciling items resulted
in a $105million increase in net income in 2008 compared to 2007. The
increase resulted primarily from a $19million after-tax gain from the sale
of telecommunication assets, a $10million after-tax gain from the
settlement of litigation relating to formerly-owned international assets, a
$41million reduction in interest expense associated with the revolving
credit facility, and income tax adjustments associated with the favorable
settlement of tax positions taken on federal returns in prior years. These
increases were partially offset by the absence of the gain from the sale of
First Communications $13million, net of taxes in 2007.

certain employees. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service
and compensation levels. We also provide health care benefits, which include
certain employee contributions, deductibles, and co-payments, upon retirement to
employees hired prior to January1, 2005, their dependents, and under
certain circumstances, their survivors. Our benefit plan assets and obligations
are remeasured annually using a December31 measurement date.Adverse
market conditions during 2008 increased 2009 costs, which were partially offset
by the effects of a $500million voluntary cash pension contribution and an
OPEB plan amendment in 2009 see Note3. Strengthened equity markets
during 2007 and a $300million voluntary cash pension contribution made in
2007 contributed to the reductions in postretirement benefits expenses in 2008.
Pension and OPEB expenses are included in various cost categories and have
contributed to cost increases discussed above for 2009. The following table
reflects the portion of qualified and non-qualified pension and OPEB costs that
were charged to expense in the three years ended December31,
2009:

As of
December31, 2009, our pension plan was underfunded and we currently
anticipate that additional cash contributions will be required in 2012 for the
2011 plan year. The overall actual investment result during 2009 was a gain of
136% compared to an assumed 9% return. Based on discount rates of 6% for
pension and 575% for OPEB, 2010 pre-tax net periodic pension and OPEB expense
will be approximately $89million.
SUPPLY
PLAN
Regulated
Commodity Sourcing
The
Utilities have a default service obligation to provide the required power supply
to non-shopping customers who have elected to continue to receive service under
regulated retail tariffs. The volume of these sales can vary depending on the
level of shopping that occurs. Supply plans vary by state and by service
territory. JCPLs default service supply is secured through a statewide
competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. The Ohio Utilities and
Penns default service supplies are provided through a competitive procurement
process approved by the PUCO and PPUC, respectively. The default service supply
for Met-Ed and Penelec is secured through a FERC-approved agreement with FES. If
any unaffiliated suppliers fail to deliver power to any one of the Utilities
service areas, the Utility serving that area may need to procure the required
power in the market in their role as a PLR.
Unregulated
Commodity Sourcing
FES has
retail and wholesale competitive load-serving obligations in Ohio, New Jersey,
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois serving both affiliated and
non-affiliated companies. FES provides energy products and services to customers
under various PLR, shopping, competitive-bid and non-affiliated contractual
obligations. In 2009, FES generation was used to serve two main obligations affiliated companies utilized approximately 76% of its total generation and
direct retail customers utilized approximately 18% of FES' total generation.
Geographically, approximately 67% of FES obligation is located in the MISO
market area and 33% is located in the PJM market area.
FES
provides energy and energy related services, including the generation and sale
of electricity and energy planning and procurement through retail and wholesale
competitive supply arrangements. FES controls either through ownership, lease,
affiliated power contracts or participation in OVEC 14,346MW of installed
generating capacity. FES supplies the power requirements of its competitive
load-serving obligations through a combination of subsidiary-owned generation,
non-affiliated contracts and spot market transactions.
CAPITAL
RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
As of
January 31, 2010 we hadcommitments ofapproximately $34billion
of liquidity including a $275billion revolving credit facility, a
$100million bank line available to FES and $515million of accounts
receivable financing facilities through our Ohio and Pennsylvania utilities. We
expect our existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet our
anticipated obligations and those of our subsidiaries. Our business is capital
intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses,
construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and interest and dividend
payments. During 2009 and in subsequent years, we expect to satisfy these
requirements with a combination of cash from operations and funds from the
capital markets as market conditions warrant. We also expect that borrowing
capacity under credit facilities will continue to be available to manage working
capital requirements during those periods.
75
As of
December31, 2009, our net deficit in working capital current assets less
current liabilities was principally due to short-term borrowings
$12billion and the classification of certain variable interest rate
PCRBs as currently payable long-term debt. Currently payable long-term debt as
of December31, 2009, included the following in millions:

receivables permit.
Revolving
Credit Facility
We have
the capability to request an increase in the total commitments available under
the $275billion revolving credit facility included in the borrowing
capability table above up to a maximum of $325billion, subject to the
discretion of each lender to provide additional commitments. Commitments under
the facility are available until August24, 2012, unless the lenders agree,
at the request of the borrowers, to an unlimited number of additional one-year
extensions. Generally, borrowings under the facility must be repaid within 364
days. Available amounts for each borrower are subject to a specified sub-limit,
as well as applicable regulatory and other limitations.
The
following table summarizes the borrowing sub-limits for each borrower under the
facility, as well as the limitations on short-term indebtedness applicable to
each borrower under current regulatory approvals and applicable statutory and/or
charter limitations as of December31, 2009:

sub-limits for CEI and TE may be increased to up to $500million by
delivering notice to the administrative agent that such borrower has
senior unsecured debt ratings of at least BBB by SP and Baa2 by
Moody.
4The
borrowing sub-limit for ATSI may be increased up to $100million by
delivering notice to the administrative agent that ATSI has received
regulatory approval to have short-term borrowings up to the same
amount.
Under
the revolving credit facility, borrowers may request the issuance of LOCs
expiring up to one year from the date of issuance. The stated amount of
outstanding LOCs will count against total commitments available under the
facility and against the applicable borrower borrowing sub-limit.
The
revolving credit facility contains financial covenants requiring each borrower
to maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than
65%, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December31, 2009,
our debt to total capitalization ratios as defined under the revolving credit
facility were as follows:

As
of December31, 2009, FirstEnergy could issue additional debt of
approximately $25billion, or recognize a reduction in equity of
approximately $14billion, and remain within the limitations of the
financial covenants required by its revolving credit
facility.
The
revolving credit facility does not contain provisions that either restrict the
ability to borrow or accelerate repayment of outstanding advances as a result of
any change in credit ratings. Pricing is defined in pricing grids, whereby the
cost of funds borrowed under the facility is related to the credit ratings of
the company borrowing the funds.
FirstEnergy
Money Pools
FirstEnergy
regulated companies also have the ability to borrow from each other and the
holding company to meet their short-term working capital requirements. A similar
but separate arrangement exists among FirstEnergy unregulated companies. FESC
administers these two money pools and tracks surplus funds of FirstEnergy and
the respective regulated and unregulated subsidiaries, as well as proceeds
available from bank borrowings. Companies receiving a loan under the money pool
agreements must repay the principal amount of the loan, together with accrued
interest, within 364 days of borrowing the funds. The rate of interest is the
same for each company receiving a loan from their respective pool and is based
on the average cost of funds available through the pool. The average interest
rate for borrowings in 2009 was 072% for the regulated companies' money pool
and 090% for the unregulated companies' money pool.
77
Pollution
Control Revenue Bonds
As of
December31, 2009, our currently payable long-term debt included
approximately $16billion FES - $15billion, Met-Ed 29million and Penelec - $45million of variable interest rate
PCRBs, the bondholders of which are entitled to the benefit of irrevocable
direct pay bank LOCs. The interest rates on the PCRBs are reset daily or weekly.
Bondholders can tender their PCRBs for mandatory purchase prior to maturity with
the purchase price payable from remarketing proceeds or, if the PCRBs are not
successfully remarketed, by drawings on the irrevocable direct pay LOCs. The
subsidiary obligor is required to reimburse the applicable LOC bank for any such
drawings or, if the LOC bank fails to honor its LOC for any reason, must itself
pay the purchase price.

In 2009,
holders of approximately $434million of LOC-supported PCRBs of OE and NGC
were notified that the applicable Wachovia Bank LOCs were set to expire. As a
result, these PCRBs were subject to mandatory purchase at a price equal to the
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, which OE and NGC funded
through short-term borrowings. FGCO remarketed $100million of those PCRBs,
which were previously held by OE and NGC and remarketed the remaining
$334million of PCRBs, of which $170million was remarketed in fixed
interest rate modes and secured by FMBs, thereby eliminating the need for
third-party credit support. Also during 2009, FGCO and NGC remarketed
approximately $329million of other PCRBs supported by LOCs set to expire
in 2009. Those PCRBs were also remarketed in fixed interest rate modes and
secured by FMBs, thereby eliminating the need for third-party credit support.
FGCO and NGC delivered FMBs to certain LOC banks listed above in connection with
amendments to existing LOC and reimbursement agreements supporting twelve other
series of PCRBs as described below and pledged FMBs to the applicable trustee
under six separate series of PCRBs. On August14, 2009, $177million
of non-LOC supported fixed rate PCRBs were issued and sold on behalf of FGCO to
pay a portion of the cost of acquiring, constructing and installing air quality
facilities at its W.H. Sammis Generating Station.
Long-Term
Debt Capacity
As of
December 31, 2009, the Ohio Companies and Penn had the aggregate capability to
issue approximately $14billion of additional FMBs on the basis of
property additions and retired bonds under the terms of their respective
mortgage indentures. The issuance of FMBs by the Ohio Companies is also subject
to provisions of their senior note indentures generally limiting the incurrence
of additional secured debt, subject to certain exceptions that would permit,
among other things, the issuance of secured debt including FMBs supporting
pollution control notes or similar obligations, or as an extension, renewal or
replacement of previously outstanding secured debt. In addition, these
provisions would permit OE and CEI to incur additional secured debt not
otherwise permitted by a specified exception of up to $127million and
$36million, respectively, as of December31, 2009.In April
2009, TE issued $300 million of new senior secured notes backed by FMBs.
Concurrently with that issuance, and in order to satisfy the limitation on
secured debt under its senior note indenture, TE issued an additional
$300million of FMBs to secure $300 million of its outstanding unsecured
senior notes originally issued in November 2006. As a result, the provisions for
TE to incur additional secured debt do not apply.
Based
upon FGCO FMB indenture, net earnings and available bondable property
additions as of December31, 2009, FGCO had the capability to issue
$22billion of additional FMBs under the terms of that indenture. On
June16, 2009, FGCO issued a total of approximately $3959 million
principal amount of FMBs, of which $2477million related to three new
refunding series of PCRBs and approximately $1482million related to
amendments to existing LOC and reimbursement agreements supporting two other
series of PCRBs. On June30, 2009, FGCO issued a total of approximately
$521million principal amount of FMBs related to three existing series of
PCRBs repurchased in October 2009, as described above.
78
In June
2009, a new FMB indenture became effective for NGC. On June16, 2009, NGC
issued a total of approximately $4875million principal amount of FMBs, of
which $1075million related to one new refunding series of PCRBs and
approximately $380 million related to amendments to existing LOC and
reimbursement agreements supporting seven other series of PCRBs. In addition, on
June16, 2009, NGC issued an FMB in a principal amount of up to
$500million in connection with NGC delivery of a Surplus Margin Guaranty
of FES obligations to post and maintain collateral under the PSA entered into
by FES with the Ohio Companies as a result of the May 13-14, 2009 CBP auction.
On June30, 2009, NGC issued a total of approximately $2733million
principal amount of FMBs, of which approximately $92million related to
three existing series of PCRBs $296million repurchased in October 2009,
as described above and approximately $1813million related to amendments
to existing LOC and reimbursement agreements supporting three other series of
PCRBs. Based upon NGCs FMB indenture, net earnings and available bondable
property additions, NGC had the capability to issue $294million of
additional FMBs as of December31, 2009.
Met-Ed
and Penelec had the capability to issue secured debt of approximately
$379million and $319million, respectively, under provisions of their
senior note indentures as of December31, 2009.
FirstEnergy
access to capital markets and costs of financing are influenced by the ratings
of its securities. The following table displays FirstEnergy, FES' and the
Utilities' securities ratings as of February11, 2010. On February 11,
2010, SP issued a report lowering FirstEnergys and its subsidiaries
credit ratings by one notch, while maintaining its stable outlook. As a result,
FirstEnergy may be required to post up to $48 million of collateral see Note
15B. Moody and Fitch affirmed the ratings and stable outlook of FirstEnergy
and its subsidiaries on February 11, 2010.

On
September 22, 2008, FirstEnergy, along with the Shelf Registrants, filed an
automatically effective shelf registration statement with the SEC for an
unspecified number and amount of securities to be offered thereon. The shelf
registration provides FirstEnergy the flexibility to issue and sell various
types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities,
warrants, share purchase contracts, and share purchase units. The Shelf
Registrants have utilized, and may in the future utilize, the shelf registration
statement to offer and sell unsecured and, in some cases, secured debt
securities.
Changes
in Cash Position
As of
December 31, 2009, we had $874 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to
$545 million as of December31, 2008. Cash and cash equivalents consist of
unrestricted, highly liquid instruments with an original or remaining maturity
of three months or less. As of December31, 2009 and 2008, FirstEnergy had
approximately $12million and $17million, respectively, of restricted
cash included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
79
During
2009, we received $972million of cash dividends from our subsidiaries and
paid $670million in cash dividends to common shareholders. There are no
material restrictions on the payment of cash dividends by our subsidiaries. In
addition to paying dividends from retained earnings, each of our electric
utility subsidiaries has authorization from the FERC to pay cash dividends from
paid-in capital accounts, as long as its debt to total capitalization ratio
without consideration of retained earnings remains below 65%. CEI and TE are
the only utility subsidiaries currently precluded from that action.
Cash
Flows from Operating Activities
Our
consolidated net cash from operating activities is provided primarily by our
energy delivery services and competitive energy services businesses see Results
of Operations above. Net cash provided from operating activities was
$25billion in 2009, $22billion in 2008 and $17billion in
2007, as summarized in the following table:

Net cash
provided from operating activities increased by $241million in 2009
primarily due to an increase in non-cash charges and other adjustments of
$876million and an increase in working capital and other of $214,
partially offset by a $500million pension trust contribution in 2009 and a
$349million decrease in net income see Results of Operations
above.
The
increase in non-cash charges and other adjustments is primarily due to higher
net amortization of regulatory assets $282million, including CEIs
$216million regulatory asset impairment, an increase in the provision for
depreciation $59million and the modification of certain purchased power
contracts that resulted in a mark-to-market charge of approximately
$205million see Note6. Also included in non-cash charges and other
adjustments was a $146million charge relating to debt redemptions in 2009,
of which $123million was related primarily to premiums paid and included
as a cash outflow in financing activities. The changes in working capital and
other primarily resulted from a $268million decrease in prepaid taxes due
to decreased tax payments.
Net cash
provided from operating activities increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an
increase in non-cash charges primarily due to lower deferrals of new regulatory
assets and purchased power costs and higher deferred income taxes. The deferral
of new regulatory assets decreased primarily as a result of the Ohio Companies
transmission and fuel recovery riders that became effective in July 2007 and
January 2008, respectively, and the absence of the deferral of decommissioning
costs related to the Saxton nuclear research facility in the first quarter of
2007. Lower deferrals of purchased power costs reflected an increase in the
market value of NUG power. The change in deferred income taxes is primarily due
to additional tax depreciation under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, the
settlement of tax positions taken on federal returns in prior years, and the
absence of deferred income taxes related to the Bruce Mansfield Unit1 sale
and leaseback transaction in 2007. The changes in working capital and other
primarily resulted from changes in accrued taxes of $110million and
prepaid taxes of $278million, primarily due to increased tax payments.
Changes in materials and supplies of $131million resulted from higher
fossil fuel inventories and were partially offset by changes in receivables of
$107million.
Cash
Flows From Financing Activities
In 2009,
net cash provided from financing activities was $49million compared to
$12billion in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to increased long-term
debt redemptions $16billion and increased repayments on short-term
borrowings $27billion, partially offset by increased long-term debt
issuances in 2009 $33billion. The increased long-term debt redemptions
were primarily due to the $12billion tender offer for holding company
notes completed by FirstEnergy in September 2009, including approximately
$122million of premiums and redemption expenses paid. The short-term
repayments in 2009 were primarily due to net repayments on the
$275billion revolving credit facility see Revolving Credit Facility
above compared to net borrowings on the facility in 2008. The following table
summarizes security issuances net of any discounts and redemptions, including
premiums paid to debt holders as a result of the tender offer.

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash
flows used in investing activities resulted principally from property additions.
Additions for the energy delivery services segment primarily include
expenditures related to transmission and distribution facilities. Capital
spending by the competitive energy services segment is principally
generation-related. The following table summarizes investing activities for the

Net cash
used for investing activities in 2009 decreased by $798 million compared to
2008. The change was principally due to a $685million decrease in property
additions, which reflects lower AQC system expenditures and the absence in 2009
of the purchase of certain lessor equity interests in Beaver Valley Unit2
and Perry and the purchase of the partially-completed Fremont Energy Center. Net
cash used for other investing activities decreased primarily due to the
liquidation of restricted funds used for debt redemptions in 2009 combined with
decreased cash investments in the Signal Peak coal mining project in 2009 as
compared to 2008.
Net cash
used for investing activities in 2008 increased by $27 billion compared to
2007. The change was principally due to a $13billion increase in property
additions and the absence of $13 billion of cash proceeds from the Bruce
Mansfield Unit1 sale and leaseback transaction that occurred in the third
quarter of 2007. The increased property additions reflected the acquisitions
described above and higher planned AQC system expenditures in 2008. Cash used
for other investing activities increased primarily as a result of the 2008
investments in the Signal Peak coal mining project and future-year emission
allowances.
Our
capital spending for 2010 is expected to be approximately $17billion
excluding nuclear fuel, of which $241million relates to AQC system
expenditures. Capital spending for 2011 and 2012 is expected to be approximately
$10 billion to $12billion each year. Our capital spending investments
for additional nuclear fuel during 2010 is estimated to be approximately
$170million.

Guarantees
and Other Assurances
As part
of normal business activities, we enter into various agreements on behalf of our
subsidiaries to provide financial or performance assurances to third parties.
These agreements include contract guarantees, surety bonds and LOCs. Some of the
guaranteed contracts contain collateral provisions that are contingent upon
either our or our subsidiaries credit ratings.
As of
December31, 2009, our maximum exposure to potential future payments under
outstanding guarantees and other assurances approximated $42billion, as
summarized below:

We
guarantee energy and energy-related payments of our subsidiaries involved in
energy commodity activities principally to facilitate or hedge normal physical
transactions involving electricity, gas, emission allowances and coal. We also
provide guarantees to various providers of credit support for the financing or
refinancing by our subsidiaries of costs related to the acquisition of property,
plant and equipment. These agreements legally obligate us to fulfill the
obligations of those subsidiaries directly involved in energy and energy-related
transactions or financings where the law might otherwise limit the
counterparties' claims. If demands of a counterparty were to exceed the ability
of a subsidiary to satisfy existing obligations, our guarantee enables the
counterparty legal claim to be satisfied by our other assets. We believe the
likelihood is remote that such parental guarantees will increase amounts
otherwise paid by us to meet our obligations incurred in connection with ongoing
energy and energy-related activities.
While
these types of guarantees are normally parental commitments for the future
payment of subsidiary obligations, subsequent to the occurrence of a credit
rating downgrade to below investment grade, an acceleration of payment or
funding obligation, or material adverse event, the immediate posting of cash
collateral, provision of an LOC or accelerated payments may be required of the
subsidiary. On February 11, 2010, SP issued a report lowering FirstEnergys
and its subsidiaries credit ratings by one notch, while maintaining its stable
outlook. As a result, FirstEnergy may be required to post up to $48million
of collateral. Moody and Fitch affirmed the ratings and stable outlook of
FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries on February11, 2010. As of
December31, 2009, our maximum exposure under these collateral provisions
was $648million, including the $48 million related to the credit rating
downgrade by SP on February 11, 2010, as shown below:

$658million due to a below investment grade credit rating.
Most of
our surety bonds are backed by various indemnities common within the insurance
industry. Surety bonds and related guarantees provide additional assurance to
outside parties that contractual and statutory obligations will be met in a
number of areas including construction contracts, environmental commitments and
various retail transactions.
In
addition to guarantees and surety bonds, FES contracts, including power
contracts with affiliates awarded through competitive bidding processes,
typically contain margining provisions which require the posting of cash or LOCs
in amounts determined by future power price movements. Based on FES power
portfolio as of December 31, 2009, and forward prices as of that date, FES had
$179 million outstanding in margining accounts. Under a hypothetical adverse
change in forward prices 95% confidence level change in forward prices over a
one year time horizon, FES would be required to post an additional
$129million. Depending on the volume of forward contracts entered and
future price movements, FES could be required to post significantly higher
amounts for margining.
In
connection with FES obligations to post and maintain collateral under the
two-year PSA entered into by FES and the Ohio Companies following the CBP
auction on May 13-14, 2009, NGC entered into a Surplus Margin Guaranty in an
amount up to $500million. The Surplus Margin Guaranty is secured by an NGC
FMB issued in favor of the Ohio Companies.
FES
debt obligations are generally guaranteed by its subsidiaries, FGCO and NGC,
pursuant to guarantees entered into on March 26, 2007. Similar guarantees were
entered into on that date pursuant to which FES guaranteed the debt obligations
of each of FGCO and NGC. Accordingly, present and future holders of indebtedness
of FES, FGCO and NGC will have claims against each of FES, FGCO and NGC
regardless of whether their primary obligor is FES, FGCO or NGC.
OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
FES and
the Ohio Companies have obligations that are not included on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets related to sale and leaseback arrangements involving the Bruce
Mansfield Plant, Perry Unit1 and Beaver Valley Unit2, which are
satisfied through operating lease payments. The total present value of these
sale and leaseback operating lease commitments, net of trust investments, was
$17billion as of December31, 2009, and December31,
2008.
We have
equity ownership interests in certain businesses that are accounted for using
the equity method of accounting for investments. There are no undisclosed
material contingencies related to these investments. Certain guarantees that we
do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial
condition, liquidity or results of operations are disclosed under Guarantees
and Other Assurances above.
MARKET
RISK INFORMATION
We use
various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative contracts,
primarily to manage the risk of price and interest rate fluctuations. Our Risk
Policy Committee, comprised of members of senior management, provides general
oversight for risk management activities throughout the company.
84
Commodity
Price Risk
FirstEnergy
is exposed to financial and market risks resulting from the fluctuation of
interest rates and commodity prices associated with electricity, energy
transmission, natural gas, coal, nuclear fuel and emission allowances. To manage
the volatility relating to these exposures, FirstEnergy uses a variety of
non-derivative and derivative instruments, including forward contracts, options,
futures contracts and swaps. The derivatives are used principally for hedging
purposes. Certain derivatives must be recorded at their fair value and marked to
market. The majority of FirstEnergy derivative hedging contracts qualify for
the normal purchase and normal sale exception and are therefore excluded from
the tables below. Contracts that are not exempt from such treatment include
certain power purchase agreements with NUG entities that were structured
pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and certain
purchase power contracts see Note6. The NUG entities non-trading
contracts are adjusted to fair value at the end of each quarter, with a
corresponding regulatory asset recognized for above-market costs or regulatory
liability for below-market costs. The change in the fair value of commodity
derivative contracts related to energy production during 2009 is summarized in
the following table:

The
valuation of derivative contracts is based on observable market information to
the extent that such information is available. In cases where such information
is not available, FirstEnergy relies on model-based information. The model
provides estimates of future regional prices for electricity and an estimate of
related price volatility. FirstEnergy uses these results to develop estimates of
fair value for financial reporting purposes and for internal management decision
making see Note5. Sources of information for the valuation of commodity
derivative contracts as of December31, 2009 are summarized by year in the
following table:

FirstEnergy
performs sensitivity analyses to estimate its exposure to the market risk of its
commodity positions. A hypothetical 10% adverse shift an increase or decrease
depending on the derivative position in quoted market prices in the near term
on its derivative instruments would not have had a material effect on its
consolidated financial position assets, liabilities and equity or cash flows
as of December 31, 2009. Based on derivative contracts held as of December 31,
2009, an adverse 10% change in commodity prices would decrease net income by
approximately $9million after tax during the next
12months.

Our
exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced since a significant

We are
subject to the inherent interest rate risks related to refinancing maturing debt
by issuing new debt securities. As discussed in Note7 to the consolidated
financial statements, our investments in capital trusts effectively reduce
future lease obligations, also reducing interest rate risk.
Interest
Rate Swap Agreements Fair Value Hedges
FirstEnergy
uses fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the
consolidated interest rate risk associated with the debt portfolio of its
subsidiaries. These derivatives are treated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate,
long-term debt issues, protecting against the risk of changes in the fair value
of fixed-rate debt instruments due to lower interest rates. Swap maturities,
call options, fixed interest rates and interest payment dates match those of the
underlying obligations. As of December31, 2009, the debt underlying the
$250million outstanding notional amount of interest rate swaps had a
weighted average fixed interest rate of 645%, which the swaps have converted to
a current weighted average variable rate of 54%. The fair value of the interest
rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was immaterial as of
December31, 2009.
Forward
Starting Swap Agreements - Cash Flow Hedges
FirstEnergy
uses forward starting swap agreements to hedge a portion of the consolidated
interest rate risk associated with issuances of fixed-rate, long-term debt
securities of its subsidiaries. These derivatives are treated as cash flow
hedges, protecting against the risk of changes in future interest payments
resulting from changes in benchmark U.S. Treasury rates between the date of
hedge inception and the date of the debt issuance. During 2009, FirstEnergy
terminated forward swaps with a notional value of $28billion and
recognized losses of approximately $185million, of which the ineffective
portion recognized as an adjustment to interest expense was immaterial. The
remaining effective portions will be amortized to interest expense over the life
of the hedged debt.

FirstEnergy
provides a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan that covers
substantially all of its employees and non-qualified pension plans that cover
certain employees. The plan provides defined benefits based on years of service
and compensation levels. FirstEnergy also provides health care benefits which
include certain employee contributions, deductibles, and co-payments upon
retirement to employees hired prior to January 1, 2005, their dependents, and
under certain circumstances, their survivors. The benefit plan assets and
obligations are remeasured annually using a December31 measurement date or
as significant triggering events occur. In 2009, FirstEnergy remeasured its
other postretirement benefit plans on May31, 2009, and its qualified
defined pension plan on August31, 2009, as discussed below.
FirstEnergys
other postretirement benefits plans were remeasured as of May31, 2009 as a
result of a plan amendment announced on June2, 2009, which reduced future
health care coverage subsidies paid by FirstEnergy on behalf of plan
participants. The remeasurement and plan amendment resulted in a
$48million reduction in FirstEnergys net postretirement benefit cost
including amounts capitalized for 2009 see Note3. This reduction was
partially offset by an additional $13million of net postretirement benefit
cost including amounts capitalized related to an additional liability created
by the VERO offered by FirstEnergy to qualified employees see
Note3.
On
September2, 2009, FirstEnergy elected to remeasured its qualified defined
pension plan due to a $500million voluntary contribution made by the
Utilities and ATSI. The remeasurement and voluntary contribution decreased
FirstEnergys accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately
$494million $304million, net of tax and reduced FirstEnergys net
postretirement benefit cost including amounts capitalized for 2009 by
$7million see Note3. Increases in plan assets from investment
gains during 2009 resulted in an increase to the plans' funded status of $349
millionon and an
after-tax decrease to common stockholders' equity of $19 million. The overall
actual investment result during 2009 was a gain of 136% compared to an assumed
9% positive return. Based on a 6% discount rate, 2010 pre-tax net periodic
pension and OPEB expense will be approximately $89million. As of
December31, 2009, the pension plan was underfunded. FirstEnergy currently
estimates that additional cash contributions will be required beginning in
2012.
Nuclear
decommissioning trust funds have been established to satisfy NGCs and our
Utilities nuclear decommissioning obligations. As of December31, 2009,
approximately 16% of the funds were invested in equity securities and 84% were
invested in fixed income securities, with limitations related to concentration
and investment grade ratings. The equity securities are carried at their market
value of approximately $295million as of December31, 2009. A
hypothetical 10% decrease in prices quoted by stock exchanges would result in a
$29million reduction in fair value as of December31, 2009. The
decommissioning trusts of JCPL and the Pennsylvania Companies are subject
to regulatory accounting, with unrealized gains and losses recorded as
regulatory assets or liabilities, since the difference between investments held
in trust and the decommissioning liabilities will be recovered from or refunded
to customers. NGC, OE and TE recognize in earnings the unrealized losses on
available-for-sale securities held in their nuclear decommissioning trusts as
other-than-temporary impairments. On June 18, 2009, the NRC informed FENOC that
its review tentatively concluded that a shortfall existed in the decommissioning
trust fund for Beaver Valley Unit 1. On November 24, 2009, FENOC submitted a
revised decommissioning funding calculation using the NRC formula method based
on the renewed license for Beaver Valley Unit 1, which extended operations until
2036. FENOCs submittal demonstrated that there was a de minimis shortfall. On
December11, 2009, the NRCs review of FirstEnergys methodology for the
funding of decommissioning of this facility concluded that there was reasonable
assurance of adequate decommissioning funding at the time permanent termination
of operations is expected. FirstEnergy continues to evaluate the status of its
funding obligations for the decommissioning of these nuclear
facilities.
CREDIT
RISK
Credit
risk is the risk of an obligor failure to meet the terms of any investment
contract, loan agreement or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk arises from
all activities in which success depends on issuer, borrower or counterparty
performance, whether reflected on or off the balance sheet. We engage in
transactions for the purchase and sale of commodities including gas,
electricity, coal and emission allowances. These transactions are often with
major energy companies within the industry.
87
We
maintain credit policies with respect to our counterparties to manage overall
credit risk. This includes performing independent risk evaluations, actively
monitoring portfolio trends and using collateral and contract provisions to
mitigate exposure. As part of our credit program, we aggressively manage the
quality of our portfolio of energy contracts, evidenced by a current weighted
average risk rating for energy contract counterparties of BBB SP. As of
December31, 2009, the largest credit concentration was with Morgan
Stanley, which is currently rated investment grade, representing 73% of our
total approved credit risk.
REGULATORY
MATTERS
Regulatory
assets that do not earn a current return totaled approximately $187 million as
of December31, 2009 JCPL - $36million, Met-Ed 114million, and Penelec - $37 million. Regulatory assets not earning a
current return primarily for certain regulatory transition costs and employee
postretirement benefits are expected to be recovered by 2014 for JCPL and
by 2020 for Met-Ed and Penelec. The following table discloses regulatory assets

On June
7, 2007, the Ohio Companies filed an application for an increase in electric
distribution rates with the PUCO and, on August6, 2007, updated their
filing. On January21, 2009, the PUCO granted the Ohio Companies
application in part to increase electric distribution rates by
$1366million OE - $689million, CEI - $292million and TE 385million. These increases went into effect for OE and TE on
January23, 2009, and for CEI on May 1, 2009. Applications for rehearing of
this order were filed by the Ohio Companies and one other party on February 20,
2009. The PUCO granted these applications for rehearing on March18, 2009
for the purpose of further consideration. The PUCO has not yet issued a
substantive Entry on Rehearing.
88
SB221,
which became effective on July31, 2008, required all electric utilities to
file an ESP, and permitted the filing of an MRO. On July31, 2008, the Ohio
Companies filed with the PUCO a comprehensive ESP and a separate MRO. The PUCO
denied the MRO application; however, the PUCO later granted the Ohio Companies
application for rehearing for the purpose of further consideration of the
matter. The PUCO has not yet issued a substantive Entry on
Rehearing.The ESP proposed to phase in new generation rates for
customers beginning in 2009 for up to a three-year period and resolve the Ohio
Companies collection of fuel costs deferred in 2006 and 2007, and the
distribution rate request described above. In response to the PUCOs
December19, 2008 order, which significantly modified and approved the ESP
as modified, the Ohio Companies notified the PUCO that they were withdrawing and
terminating the ESP application in addition to continuing their rate plan then
in effect as allowed by the terms of SB221. On December31, 2008, the Ohio
Companies conducted a CBP for the procurement of electric generation for retail
customers from January 5, 2009 through March 31, 2009. The average winning bid
price was equivalent to a retail rate of 698 cents per KWH. The power supply
obtained through this process provided generation service to the Ohio Companies
retail customers who chose not to shop with alternative suppliers. On
January9, 2009, the Ohio Companies requested the implementation of a new
fuel rider to recover the costs resulting from the December31, 2008 CBP.
The PUCO ultimately approved the Ohio Companies request for a new fuel rider to
recover increased costs resulting from the CBP but denied OEs and TEs request
to continue collecting RTC and denied the request to allow the Ohio Companies to
continue collections pursuant to the two existing fuel riders. The new fuel
rider recovered the increased purchased power costs for OE and TE, and recovered
a portion of those costs for CEI, with the remainder being deferred for future
recovery.
On
January 29, 2009, the PUCO ordered its Staff to develop a proposal to establish
an ESP for the Ohio Companies. On February19, 2009, the Ohio Companies
filed an Amended ESP application, including an attached Stipulation and
Recommendation that was signed by the Ohio Companies, the Staff of the PUCO, and
many of the intervening parties. Specifically, the Amended ESP provided that
generation would be provided by FES at the average wholesale rate of the
CBPdescribed above for April and May 2009 to the Ohio Companies for their
non-shopping customers; for the period of June1, 2009 through May31,
2011, retail generation prices would be based upon the outcome of a descending
clock CBP on a slice-of-system basis. The Amended ESP further provided that the
Ohio Companies will not seek a base distribution rate increase, subject to
certain exceptions, with an effective date of such increase before
January1, 2012, that CEI would agree to write-off approximately
$216million of its Extended RTC regulatory asset, and that the Ohio
Companies would collect a delivery service improvement rider at an overall
average rate of $002 per KWH for the period of April1, 2009 through
December31, 2011. The Amended ESP also addressed a number of other issues,
including but not limited to, rate design for various customer classes, and
resolution of the prudence review and the collection of deferred costs that were
approved in prior proceedings. On February26, 2009, the Ohio Companies
filed a Supplemental Stipulation, which was signed or not opposed by virtually
all of the parties to the proceeding, that supplemented and modified certain
provisions of the February19, 2009 Stipulation and Recommendation.
Specifically, the Supplemental Stipulation modified the provision relating to
governmental aggregation and the Generation Service Uncollectible Rider,
provided further detail on the allocation of the economic development funding
contained in the Stipulation and Recommendation, and proposed additional
provisions related to the collaborative process for the development of energy
efficiency programs, among other provisions. The PUCO adopted and approved
certain aspects of the Stipulation and Recommendation on March4, 2009, and
adopted and approved the remainder of the Stipulation and Recommendation and
Supplemental Stipulation without modification on March25, 2009. Certain
aspects of the Stipulation and Recommendation and Supplemental Stipulation took
effect on April1, 2009 while the remaining provisions took effect on
June1, 2009.
The CBP
auction occurred on May13-14, 2009, and resulted in a weighted average
wholesale price for generation and transmission of 615 cents per KWH. The bid
was for a single, two-year product for the service period from June1, 2009
through May 31, 2011. FES participated in the auction, winning 51% of the
tranches one tranche equals one percent of the load supply. Subsequent to the
signing of the wholesale contracts, four winning bidders reached separate
agreements with FES with the result that FES is now responsible for providing 77
percent of the Ohio Companies total load supply.The results of the
CBP were accepted by the PUCO on May14, 2009. FES has also separately
contracted with numerous communities to provide retail generation service
through governmental aggregation programs.
On July
27, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed applications with the PUCO to recover three
different categories of deferred distribution costs on an accelerated basis. In
the Ohio Companies' Amended ESP, the PUCO approved the recovery of these
deferrals, with collection originally set to begin in January 2011 and to
continue over a 5 or 25 year period. The principal amount plus carrying charges
through August31, 2009 for these deferrals totaled $3051million.
The applications were approved by the PUCO on August 19, 2009. Recovery of this
amount, together with carrying charges calculated as approved in the Amended
ESP, commenced on September 1, 2009, and will be collected in the 18 non-summer
months from September 2009 through May 2011, subject to reconciliation until
fully collected, with $165million of the above amount being recovered from
residential customers, and $1401million being recovered from
non-residential customers.
89
SB221
also requires electric distribution utilities to implement energy efficiency
programs. Under the provisions of SB221, the Ohio Companies are required to
achieve a total annual energy savings equivalent of approximately 166,000 MWH in
2009, 290,000 MWH in 2010, 410,000 MWH in 2011, 470,000 MWH in 2012 and 530,000
MWH in 2013, with additional savings required through 2025. Utilities are also
required to reduce peak demand in 2009 by 1%, with an additional 75% reduction
each year thereafter through 2018. The PUCO may amend these benchmarks in
certain, limited circumstances, and the Ohio Companies have filed an application
with the PUCO seeking such amendments. On January 7, 2010, the PUCO amended the
2009 energy efficiency benchmarks to zero, contingent upon the Ohio Companies
meeting the revised benchmarks in a period of not more than three
years.The PUCO has not yet acted upon the application seeking a
reduction of the peak demand reduction requirements. The Ohio Companies are
presently involved in collaborative efforts related to energy efficiency,
including filing applications for approval with the PUCO, as well as other
implementation efforts arising out of the Supplemental Stipulation. On December
15, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed the required three year portfolio plan
seeking approval for the programs they intend to implement to meet the energy
efficiency and peak demand reduction requirements for the 2010-2012 period. The
PUCO has set the matter for hearing on March 2, 2010. The Ohio Companies expect
that all costs associated with compliance will be recoverable from
customers.
In
October 2009, the PUCO issued additional Entries modifying certain of its
previous rules that set out the manner in which electric utilities, including
the Ohio Companies, will be required to comply with benchmarks contained in
SB221 related to the employment of alternative energy resources, energy
efficiency/peak demand reduction programs as well as greenhouse gas reporting
requirements and changes to long term forecast reporting requirements.
Applications for rehearing filed in mid-November 2009 were granted on December
9, 2009 for the sole purpose of further consideration of the matters raised in
those applications.The PUCO has not yet issued a substantive Entry
on Rehearing.The rules implementing the requirements of SB221 went
into effect on December 10, 2009. The Ohio Companies, on October27, 2009,
submitted an application to amend their 2009 statutory energy efficiency
benchmarks to zero. As referenced above, on January 7, 2010, the PUCO issued an
Order granting the Ohio Companies request to amend the energy efficiency
benchmarks.
Additionally
under SB221, electric utilities and electric service companies are required to
serve part of their load from renewable energy resources equivalent to 025% of
the KWH they serve in 2009.In August and October 2009, the Ohio
Companies conducted RFPs to secure RECs. The RFPs sought renewable energy RECs,
including solar and RECs generated in Ohio in order to meet the Ohio Companies
alternative energy requirements as set forth in SB221 for 2009, 2010 and
2011.The RECs acquired through these two RFPs will be used to help
meet the renewable energy requirements established under SB221 for 2009, 2010
and 2011. On December 7, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the
PUCO seeking a force majeure determination regarding the Ohio Companies
compliance with the 2009 solar energy resources benchmark, and seeking a
reduction in the benchmark. The PUCO has not yet ruled on that
application.
On
October 20, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed an MRO to procure electric generation
service for the period beginning June1, 2011. The proposed MRO would
establish a CBP to secure generation supply for customers who do not shop with
an alternative supplier and would be similar, in all material respects, to the
CBP conducted in May 2009 in that it would procure energy, capacity and certain
transmission services on a slice of system basis. However, unlike the May 2009
CBP, the MRO would include multiple bidding sessions and multiple products with
different delivery periods for generation supply designed to reduce potential
volatility and supplier risk and encourage bidder participation. A technical
conference was held on October 29, 2009. Hearings took place in December 2009
and the matter has been fully briefed. Pursuant to SB221, the PUCO has 90 days
from the date of the application to determine whether the MRO meets certain
statutory requirements. Although the Ohio Companies requested a PUCO
determination by January18, 2010, on February 3, 2010, the PUCO announced
that its determination would be delayed. Under a determination that such
statutory requirements are met, the Ohio Companies would be able to implement
the MRO and conduct the CBP.
Pennsylvania
Met-Ed
and Penelec purchase a portion of their PLR and default service requirements
from FES through a fixed-price partial requirements wholesale power sales
agreement. The agreement allows Met-Ed and Penelec to sell the output of NUG
energy to the market and requires FES to provide energy at fixed prices to
replace any NUG energy sold to the extent needed for Met-Ed and Penelec to
satisfy their PLR and default service obligations.
On
February 20, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec filed with the PPUC a generation
procurement plan covering the period January1, 2011 through May31,
2013. The plan is designed to provide adequate and reliable service via a
prudent mix of long-term, short-term and spot market generation supply, as
required by Act129. The plan proposed a staggered procurement schedule,
which varies by customer class, through the use of a descending clock auction.
On August 12, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec filed a settlement agreement with the
PPUC for the generation procurement plan covering the period January 1, 2011,
through May 31, 2013, reflecting the settlement on all but two issues. The
settlement plan proposes a staggered procurement schedule, which varies by
customer class. On September 2, 2009, the ALJ issued a Recommended Decision RD
approving the settlement and adopted the Met-Ed and Penelecs positions on two
reserved issues. On November 6, 2009, the PPUC entered an Order approving the
settlement and finding in favor of Met-Ed and Penelec on the two reserved
issues.Generation procurement began in January 2010.
90
On May
22, 2008, the PPUC approved Met-Ed and Penelec annual updates to the TSC rider
for the period June1, 2008, through May31, 2009. The TSCs included a
component for under-recovery of actual transmission costs incurred during the
prior period Met-Ed - $144million and Penelec - $4 million and
transmission cost projections for June 2008 through May 2009 Met-Ed 258million and Penelec - $92million. Met-Ed received PPUC approval
for a transition approach that would recover past under-recovered costs plus
carrying charges through the new TSC over thirty-one months and defer a portion
of the projected costs $92million plus carrying charges for recovery
through future TSCs by December31, 2010. Various intervenors filed
complaints against those filings. In addition, the PPUC ordered an investigation
to review the reasonableness of Met-Eds TSC, while at the same time allowing
Met-Ed to implement the rider June1, 2008, subject to refund. On
July15, 2008, the PPUC directed the ALJ to consolidate the complaints
against Met-Ed with its investigation and a litigation schedule was adopted.
Hearings and briefing for both Met-Ed and Penelec have concluded. On
August11, 2009, the ALJ issued a Recommended Decision to the PPUC
approving Met-Eds and Penelecs TSCs as filed and dismissing all complaints.
Exceptions by various interveners were filed and reply exceptions were filed by
Met-Ed and Penelec.On January 28, 2010, the PPUC adopted a motion
which denies the recovery of marginal transmission losses through the TSC for
the period of June1, 2007 through March 31, 2008, and instructs Met-Ed and
Penelec to work with the parties and file a petition to retain any
over-collection, with interest, until 2011 for the purpose of providing
mitigation of future rate increases starting in 2011 for their
customers.Met-Ed and Penelec are now awaiting an order, which is
expected to be consistent with the motion. If so, Met-Ed and Penelec plan to
appeal such a decision to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. Although the
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, it is the
belief of the companies that they should prevail in any such appeal and
therefore expect to fully recover the approximately $1705 million
$1387million for Met-Ed and $318million for Penelec in marginal
transmission losses for the period prior to January 1, 2011.
On May
28, 2009, the PPUC approved Met-Eds and Penelecs annual updates to their TSC
rider for the period June1, 2009 through May31, 2010 subject to the
outcome of the proceeding related to the 2008 TSC filing described above, as
required in connection with the PPUCs January 2007 rate order. For Penelecs
customers the new TSC resulted in an approximate 1% decrease in monthly bills,
reflecting projected PJM transmission costs as well as a reconciliation for
costs already incurred. The TSC for Met-Eds customers increased to recover the
additional PJM charges paid by Met-Ed in the previous year and to reflect
updated projected costs. In order to gradually transition customers to the
higher rate, the PPUC approved Met-Eds proposal to continue to recover the
prior period deferrals allowed in the PPUCs May 2008 Order and defer $575
million of projected costs to a future TSC to be fully recovered by
December31, 2010. Under this proposal, monthly bills for Met-Eds
customers would increase approximately 94% for the period June 2009 through May
2010.
Act 129
became effective in 2008 and addresses issues such as: energy efficiency and
peak load reduction; generation procurement; time-of-use rates; smart meters;
and alternative energy. Among other things Act 129 requires utilities to file
with the PPUC an energy efficiency and peak load reduction plan by July1,
2009, setting forth the utilities plans to reduce energy consumption by a
minimum of 1% and 3% by May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2013, respectively, and to
reduce peak demand bya minimum of 45% by May 31, 2013. On July1,
2009, Met-Ed, Penelec, and Penn filed EEC Plans with the PPUC in accordance
with Act 129. The Pennsylvania Companies submitted a supplemental filing on July
31, 2009, to revise the Total Resource Cost test items in the EEC Plans
pursuant to the PPUCs June 23, 2009 Order. Following an evidentiary hearing and
briefing, the Pennsylvania Companies filed revised EEC Plans on
September21, 2009. In an October 28, 2009 Order, the PPUC approved in
part, and rejected in part, the Pennsylvania Companies' filing. Following
additional filings related to the plans, including modifications as required by
the PPUC, the PPUC issued an order on January 28, 2010, approving, in part, and
rejecting, in part the Pennsylvania Companies modified plans. The Pennsylvania
Companies filed final plans and tariff revisions on February 5, 2010 consistent
with the minor revisions required by the PPUC.The PPUC must approve
or reject the plans within 60 days.
Act 129
also required utilities to file by August 14, 2009 with the PPUC smart meter
technology procurement and installation plan to provide for the installation of
smart meter technology within 15 years. On August14, 2009, Met-Ed, Penelec
and Penn jointly filed a Smart Meter Technology Procurement and Installation
Plan. Consistent with the PPUCs rules, this plan proposes a 24-month assessment
period in which the Pennsylvania Companies will assess their needs, select the
necessary technology, secure vendors, train personnel, install and test support
equipment, and establish a cost effective and strategic deployment schedule,
which currently is expected to be completed in fifteen years. Met-Ed, Penelec
and Penn estimate assessment period costs at approximately $295 million, which
the Pennsylvania Companies, in their plan, proposed to recover through an
automatic adjustment clause. A Technical Conference and evidentiary hearings
were held in November 2009. Briefs were filed on December 11, 2009, and Reply
Briefs were filed on December 31, 2009. An Initial Decision was issued by the
presiding ALJ on January 28, 2010.The ALJs Initial Decision
approved the Smart Meter Plan as modified by the ALJ, including: ensuring that
the smart meters to be deployed include the capabilities listed in the PPUCs
Implementation Order; eliminating the provision of interest in the 1307e
reconciliation; providing for the recovery of reasonable and prudent costs minus
resulting savings from installation and use of smart meters; and reflecting that
administrative start-up costs be expensed and the costs incurred for research
and development in the assessment period be capitalized.Exceptions
are due on February 17, 2010, and Reply Exceptions are due on March
1.The Pennsylvania Companies expect the PPUC to act on the plans in
early 2010.
91
Legislation
addressing rate mitigation and the expiration of rate caps has been introduced
in the legislative session that ended in 2008; several bills addressing these
issues were introduced in the 2009 legislative session. The final form and
impact of such legislation is uncertain.
On
February 26, 2009, the PPUC approved a Voluntary Prepayment Plan requested by
Met-Ed and Penelec that provides an opportunity for residential and small
commercial customers to prepay an amount on their monthly electric bills during
2009 and 2010. Customer prepayments earn interest at 75% and will be used to
reduce electricity charges in 2011 and 2012.
On March
31, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec submitted their 5-year NUG Statement Compliance
filing to the PPUC in accordance with their 1998 Restructuring Settlement.
Met-Ed proposed to reduce its CTC rate for the residential class with a
corresponding increase in the generation rate and the shopping credit, and
Penelec proposed to reduce its CTC rate to zero for all classes with a
corresponding increase in the generation rate and the shopping credit. While
these changes would result in additional annual generation revenue Met-Ed 27million and Penelec - $59million, overall rates would remain
unchanged. On July30, 2009, the PPUC entered an order approving the 5-year
NUG Statement, approving the reduction of the CTC, and directing Met-Ed and
Penelec to file a tariff supplement implementing this change. On July31,
2009, Met-Ed and Penelec filed tariff supplements decreasing the CTC rate in
compliance with the July30, 2009 order, and increasing the generation rate
in compliance with the Pennsylvania Companies Restructuring Orders of 1998. On
August14, 2009, the PPUC issued Secretarial Letters approving Met-Ed and
Penelecs compliance filings.
By
Tentative Order entered September17, 2009, the PPUC provided for an
additional 30-day comment period on whether the Restructuring Settlement allows
NUG over-collection for select and isolated months to be used to reduce non-NUG
stranded costs when a cumulative NUG stranded cost balance
exists.In response to the Tentative Order, the Office of
Small Business Advocate, Office of Consumer Advocate, York County Solid Waste
and Refuse Authority, ARIPPA, the Met-Ed Industrial Users Group and Penelec
Industrial Customer Alliance filed comments objecting to the above accounting
method utilized by Met-Ed and Penelec. Met-Ed and Penelec filed reply comments
on October26, 2009. On November 5, 2009, the PPUC issued a Secretarial
Letter allowing parties to file reply comments to Met-Ed and Penelecs reply
comments by November 16, 2009, and reply comments were filed by the Office of
Consumer Advocate, ARIPPA, and the Met-Ed Industrial Users Group and Penelec
Industrial Customer Alliance.Met-Ed and Penelec are awaiting further
action by the PPUC.
On
February 8, 2010, Penn filed with the PPUC a generation procurement plan
covering the period June 1, 2011 through May31, 2013. The plan is designed
to provide adequate and reliable service via a prudent mix of long-term,
short-term and spot market generation supply, as required by Act129. The
plan proposed a staggered procurement schedule, which varies by customer class,
through the use of a descending clock auction. The PPUC is required to issue an
order on the plan no later than November 8, 2010.
New
Jersey
JCPL
is permitted to defer for future collection from customers the amounts by which
its costs of supplying BGS to non-shopping customers, costs incurred under NUG
agreements, and certain other stranded costs, exceed amounts collected through
BGS and NUGC rates and market sales of NUG energy and capacity. As of December
30, 2009, the accumulated deferred cost balance totaled approximately $98
million.
In
accordance with an April28, 2004 NJBPU order, JCPL filed testimony on
June7, 2004, supporting continuation of the current level and duration of
the funding of TMI-2 decommissioning costs by New Jersey customers without a
reduction, termination or capping of the funding. On September30, 2004,
JCPL filed an updated TMI-2 decommissioning study. This study resulted in
an updated total decommissioning cost estimate of $729million in 2003
dollars compared to the estimated $528million in 2003 dollars from the
prior 1995 decommissioning study. The DPA filed comments on February28,
2005 requesting that decommissioning funding be suspended. On March18,
2005, JCPL filed a response to those comments. JCPL responded to
additional NJBPU staff discovery requests in May and November 2007 and also
submitted comments in the proceeding in November 2007. A schedule for further
NJBPU proceedings has not yet been set.On March 13, 2009, JCPL filed
its annual SBC Petition with the NJBPU that includes a request for a reduction
in the level of recovery of TMI-2 decommissioning costs based on an updated
TMI-2 decommissioning cost analysis dated January 2009. This matter is currently
pending before the NJBPU.
New
Jersey statutes require that the state periodically undertake a planning
process, known as the EMP, to address energy related issues including energy
security, economic growth, and environmental impact. The EMP is to be developed
with involvement of the Governors Office and the Governors Office of Economic
Growth, and is to be prepared by a Master Plan Committee, which is chaired by
the NJBPU President and includes representatives of several State
departments.The EMP was issued on October22, 2008,
establishing five major goals:
92
maximize
energy efficiency to achieve a 20% reduction in energy consumption by
2020;
reduce
peak demand for electricity by 5,700 MW by
2020;
meet
30% of the states electricity needs with renewable energy by
2020;
examine
smart grid technology and develop additional cogeneration and other
generation resources consistent with the states greenhouse gas targets;
and
invest
in innovative clean energy technologies and businesses to stimulate the
industrys growth in New Jersey.
On
January 28, 2009, the NJBPU adopted an order establishing the general process
and contents of specific EMP plans that must be filed by New Jersey electric and
gas utilities in order to achieve the goals of the EMP. Such utility specific
plans are due to be filed with the BPU by July 1, 2010. At this time,
FirstEnergy and JCPL cannot determine the impact, if any, the EMP may have
on their operations.
In
support of former New Jersey Governor Corzine Economic Assistance and Recovery
Plan, JCPL announced a proposal to spend approximately $98 million on
infrastructure and energy efficiency projects in 2009. Under the proposal, an
estimated $40 million would be spent on infrastructure projects, including
substation upgrades, new transformers, distribution line re-closers and
automated breaker operations. In addition, approximately $34 million would be
spent implementing new demand response programs as well as expanding on existing
programs. Another $11 million would be spent on energy efficiency, specifically
replacing transformers and capacitor control systems and installing new LED
street lights. The remaining $13 million would be spent on energy efficiency
programs that would complement those currently being offered. The project
relating to expansion of the existing demand response programs was approved by
the NJBPU on August 19, 2009, and implementation began in 2009. Approval for the
project related to energy efficiency programs intended to complement those
currently being offered was denied by the NJBPU on December 1, 2009.
Implementation of the remaining projects is dependent upon resolution of
regulatory issues including recovery of the costs associated with the
proposal.
FERC
Matters
Transmission
Service between MISO and PJM
On
November 18, 2004, the FERC issued an order eliminating the through and out rate
for transmission service between the MISO and PJM regions. The FERCs intent was
to eliminate multiple transmission charges for a single transaction between the
MISO and PJM regions. The FERC also ordered MISO, PJM and the transmission
owners within MISO and PJM to submit compliance filings containing a rate
mechanism to recover lost transmission revenues created by elimination of this
charge referred to as the Seams Elimination Cost Adjustment or SECA during a
16-month transition period. The FERC issued orders in 2005 setting the SECA for
hearing. The presiding judge issued an initial decision on August10, 2006,
rejecting the compliance filings made by MISO, PJM and the transmission owners,
and directing new compliance filings. This decision is subject to review and
approval by the FERC. A final order is pending before the FERC, and in the
meantime, FirstEnergy affiliates have been negotiating and entering into
settlement agreements with other parties in the docket to mitigate the risk of
lower transmission revenue collection associated with an adverse order. On
September 26, 2008, the MISO and PJM transmission owners filed a motion
requesting that the FERC approve the pending settlements and act on the initial
decision. On November20, 2008, FERC issued an order approving uncontested
settlements, but did not rule on the initial decision. On December19,
2008, an additional order was issued approving two contested settlements. On
October29, 2009, FirstEnergy, with another Company, filed an additional
settlement agreement with FERC to resolve their outstanding claims. FirstEnergy
is actively pursuing settlement agreements with other parties to the
case.On December 8, 2009, certain parties sought a writ of mandamus
from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals directing FERC to issue an order on the
Initial Decision. The Court agreed to hold this matter in abeyance based upon
FERCs representation to use good faith efforts to issue a substantive ruling on
the initial decision no later than May 27, 2010.If FERC fails to
act, the case will be submitted for briefing in June. The outcome of this matter
cannot be predicted.
93
PJM
Transmission Rate
On
January 31, 2005, certain PJM transmission owners made filings with the FERC
pursuant to a settlement agreement previously approved by the FERC. JCPL,
Met-Ed and Penelec were parties to that proceeding and joined in two of the
filings. In the first filing, the settling transmission owners submitted a
filing justifying continuation of their existing rate design within the PJM RTO.
Hearings were held on the content of the compliance filings and numerous parties
appeared and litigated various issues concerning PJM rate design, notably AEP,
which proposed to create a postage stamp, or average rate for all high voltage
transmission facilities across PJM and a zonal transmission rate for facilities
below 345 kV. AEP proposal would have the effect of shifting recovery of the
costs of high voltage transmission lines to other transmission zones, including
those where JCPL, Met-Ed, and Penelec serve load. On April19, 2007,
the FERC issued an order Opinion 494 finding that the PJM transmission owners
existing license plate or zonal rate design was just and reasonable and
ordered that the current license plate rates for existing transmission
facilities be retained. On the issue of rates for new transmission facilities,
the FERC directed that costs for new transmission facilities that are rated at
500 kV or higher are to be collected from all transmission zones throughout the
PJM footprint by means of a postage-stamp rate. Costs for new transmission
facilities that are rated at less than 500 kV, however, are to be allocated on a
beneficiary pays basis. The FERC found that PJMs current beneficiary-pays
cost allocation methodology is not sufficiently detailed and, in a related order
that also was issued on April 19, 2007, directed that hearings be held for the
purpose of establishing a just and reasonable cost allocation methodology for
inclusion in PJMs tariff.
On May
18, 2007, certain parties filed for rehearing of the FERCs April 19, 2007
order. On January 31, 2008, the requests for rehearing were denied. On February
11, 2008, the FERCs April 19, 2007, and January 31, 2008, orders were appealed
to the federal Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The Illinois Commerce
Commission, the PUCO and another party have also appealed these orders to the
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals of these parties and others were
consolidated for argument in the Seventh Circuit and the Seventh Circuit Court
of Appeals issued a decision on August 6, 2009. The court found that FERC had
not marshaled enough evidence to support its decision to allocate costs for new
500+ kV facilities on a postage-stamp basis and, based on this finding, remanded
the rate design issue back to FERC. A request for rehearing and rehearing en
banc by two Companies was denied by the Seventh Circuit on October20,
2009. On October 28, 2009, the Seventh Circuit closed its case dockets and
returned the case to FERC for further action on the remand order. In an order
dated January 21, 2010, FERC set the matter for paper hearings meaning that
FERC called for parties to submit comments or written testimony pursuant to the
schedule described in the order. FERC identified nine separate issues for
comments, and directed PJM to file the first round of comments on February 22,
2010, with other parties submitting responsive comments on April 8, 2010 and May
10, 2010.
The
FERCs orders on PJM rate design prevented the allocation of a portion of the
revenue requirement of existing transmission facilities of other utilities to
JCPL, Met-Ed and Penelec. In addition, the FERCs decision to allocate the
cost of new 500 kV and above transmission facilities on a postage-stamp basis
reduces the cost of future transmission to be recovered from the JCPL,
Met-Ed and Penelec zones. A partial settlement agreement addressing the
beneficiary pays methodology for below 500 kV facilities, but excluding the
issue of allocating new facilities costs to merchant transmission entities, was
filed on September 14, 2007. The agreement was supported by the FERCs Trial
Staff, and was certified by the Presiding Judge to the FERC. On July 29, 2008,
the FERC issued an order conditionally approving the settlement. On November 14,
2008, PJM submitted revisions to its tariff to incorporate cost responsibility
assignments for below 500 kV upgrades included in PJMs Regional Transmission
Expansion Planning process in accordance with the settlement. The remaining
merchant transmission cost allocation issues were the subject of a hearing at
the FERC in May 2008. On November 19, 2009, FERC issued Opinion 503 agreeing
that RTEP costs should be allocated on a pro-rata basis to merchant transmission
companies. On December 22, 2009, a request for a rehearing of FERCs Opinion No.
503 was made. On January 19, 2010, FERC issued a procedural order noting that
FERC would address the rehearing requests in a future order.
RTO
Consolidation
On
August 17, 2009, FirstEnergy filed an application with the FERC requesting to
consolidate its transmission assets and operations into PJM. Currently,
FirstEnergys transmission assets and operations are divided between PJM and
MISO. The consolidation would make the transmission assets that are part of
ATSI, whose footprint includes the Ohio Companies and Penn, part of PJM. Most of
FirstEnergys transmission assets in Pennsylvania and all of the transmission
assets in New Jersey already operate as a part of PJM. Key elements of the
filing include a Fixed Resource Requirement Plan FRR Plan that describes the
means whereby capacity will be procured and administered as necessary to satisfy
the PJM capacity requirements for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 delivery years; and
also a request that ATSIs transmission customers be excused from the costs for
regional transmission projects that were approved through PJMs RTEP process
prior to ATSIs entry into PJM legacy RTEP costs. The integration is expected
to be complete on June 1, 2011, to coincide with delivery of power under the
next competitive generation procurement process for the Ohio Companies. To
ensure a definitive ruling at the same time FERC rules on its request to
integrate ATSI into PJM, on October19, 2009, FirstEnergy filed a related
complaint with FERC on the issue of exempting the ATSI footprint from the legacy
RTEP costs.
94
On
September 4, 2009, the PUCO opened a case to take comments from Ohios
stakeholders regarding the RTO consolidation. FirstEnergy filed extensive
comments in the PUCO case on September25, 2009, and reply comments on
October13, 2009, and attended a public meeting on September15, 2009
to answer questions regarding the RTO consolidation. Several parties have
intervened in the regulatory dockets at the FERC and at the PUCO. Certain
interveners have commented and protested particular elements of the proposed RTO
consolidation, including an exit fee to MISO, integration costs to PJM, and
cost-allocations of future transmission upgrades in PJM and MISO.
On
December 17, 2009, FERC issued an order approving, subject to certain future
compliance filings, ATSIs move to PJM. FirstEnergys request to be exempted
from legacy RTEP costs was rejected and its complaint dismissed.
On
December 17, 2009, ATSI executed the PJM Consolidated Transmission Owners
Agreement. On December 18, 2009, the Ohio Companies and Penn executed the PJM
Operating Agreement and the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement. Execution of
these agreements committed ATSI and the Ohio Companies and Penns load to moving
into PJM on the schedule described in the application and approved in the FERC
Order June 1, 2011.
On
January 15, 2010, the Ohio Companies and Penn submitted a compliance filing
describing the process whereby ATSI-zone load serving entities LSEs can opt
out of the Ohio Companies' and Penn FRR Plan for the 2011-12 and 2012-13
Delivery Years. On January 16, 2010, FirstEnergy filed for clarification or
rehearing of certain issues associated with implementing the FRR auctions on the
proposed schedule. On January 19, 2010, FirstEnergy filed for rehearing of
FERCs decision to impose the legacy RTEP costs on ATSIs transmission
customers. Also on January 19, 2010, several parties, including the PUCO and the
OCC asked for rehearing of parts of FERCs order. None of the rehearing parties
asked FERC to rescind authorization for ATSI to enter PJM. Instead, parties
focused on questions of cost and cost allocation or on alleged errors in
implementing the move. On February 3, 2010, FirstEnergy filed an answer to the
January 19, 2010 rehearing requests of other parties. On February 16, 2010,
FirstEnergy submitted a second compliance filing to FERC; the filing describes
communications protocols and performance deficiency penalties for capacity
suppliers that are taken in FRR auctions.
FirstEnergy
will conduct FRR auctions on March 15-19, 2010, for the 2011-12 and 2012-13
delivery years. LSEs in the ATSI territory, including the Ohio Companies and
Penn, will participate in PJMs next base residual auction for capacity
resources for the 2013-2014 delivery years.This auction will be
conducted in May of 2010. FirstEnergy expects to integrate into PJM effective
June 1, 2011.
Changes
ordered for PJM Reliability Pricing Model RPM Auction
On
May30, 2008, a group of PJM load-serving entities, state commissions,
consumer advocates, and trade associations referred to collectively as the RPM
Buyers filed a complaint at the FERC against PJM alleging thatthree of
the fourtransitional RPM auctions yielded prices that are unjust and
unreasonable under the Federal Power Act. On September19, 2008, the FERC
denied the RPM Buyers complaint. On December12, 2008, PJM filed proposed
tariff amendments that would adjust slightly the RPM program. PJM also requested
that the FERC conduct a settlement hearing to address changes to the RPM and
suggested that the FERC should rule on the tariff amendments only if settlement
could not be reached in January 2009. The request for settlement hearings was
granted. Settlement had not been reached by January 9, 2009 and, accordingly,
FirstEnergy and other parties submitted comments on PJMs proposed tariff
amendments. On January 15, 2009, the Chief Judge issued an order terminating
settlement discussions. On February9, 2009, PJM and a group of
stakeholders submitted an offer of settlement, which used the PJM
December12, 2008 filing as its starting point, and stated that unless
otherwise specified, provisions filed by PJM on December12, 2008
apply.
On March
26, 2009, the FERC accepted in part, and rejected in part, tariff provisions
submitted by PJM, revising certain parts of its RPM. It ordered changes included
making incremental improvements to RPM andclarification on certain aspects
of the March26, 2009 Order. On April27, 2009, PJM submitted a
compliance filing addressing the changes the FERC ordered in the March26,
2009 Order; subsequently, numerous parties filed requests for rehearing of the
March26, 2009 Order. On June 18, 2009, the FERC denied rehearing and
request for oral argument of the March 26, 2009 Order.
PJM has
reconvened the Capacity Market Evolution Committee CMEC and has scheduled a
CMEC Long-Term Issues Symposium to address near-term changes directed by the
March 26, 2009 Order and other long-term issues not addressed in the February
2009 settlement. PJM made a compliance filing on September 1, 2009,
incorporating tariff changes directed by the March 26, 2009 Order. The tariff
changes were approved by the FERC in an order issued on October30, 2009,
and are effective November1, 2009. The CMEC continues to work to address
additional compliance items directed by the March26, 2009 Order. On
December 1, 2009, PJM informed FERC that PJM would file a scarcity-pricing
design with FERC on April 1, 2010.
95
MISO
Resource Adequacy Proposal
MISO
made a filing on December 28, 2007 that would create an enforceable planning
reserve requirement in the MISO tariff for load-serving entities such as the
Ohio Companies, Penn and FES. This requirement was proposed to become effective
for the planning year beginning June 1, 2009. The filing would permit MISO to
establish the reserve margin requirement for load-serving entities based upon a
one day loss of load in ten years standard, unless the state utility regulatory
agency establishes a different planning reserve for load-serving entities in its
state. FirstEnergy believes the proposal promotes a mechanism that will result
in commitments from both load-serving entities and resources, including both
generation and demand side resources that are necessary for reliable resource
adequacy and planning in the MISO footprint. The FERC conditionally approved
MISOs Resource Adequacy proposal on March 26, 2008. On June25, 2008, MISO
submitted a second compliance filing establishing the enforcement mechanism for
the reserve margin requirement which establishes deficiency payments for
load-serving entities that do not meet the resource adequacy requirements.
Numerous parties, including FirstEnergy, protested this filing.
On
October 20, 2008, the FERC issued three orders essentially permitting the MISO
Resource Adequacy program to proceed with some modifications. First, the FERC
accepted MISO financial settlement approach for enforcement of Resource
Adequacy subject to a compliance filing modifying the cost of new entry penalty.
Second, the FERC conditionally accepted MISO compliance filing on the
qualifications for purchased power agreements to be capacity resources, load
forecasting, loss of load expectation, and planning reserve zones. Additional
compliance filings were directed on accreditation of load modifying resources
and price responsive demand. Finally, the FERC largely denied rehearing of its
March 26 order with the exception of issues related to behind the meter
resources and certain ministerial matters. On April 16, 2009, the FERC issued an
additional order on rehearing and compliance, approving MISOs proposed
financial settlement provision for Resource Adequacy. The MISO Resource Adequacy
program was implemented as planned and became effective on June 1, 2009, the
beginning of the MISO planning year. On June 17, 2009, MISO submitted a
compliance filing in response to the FERCs April 16, 2009 order directing it to
address, among others, various market monitoring and mitigation issues. On July
8, 2009, various parties submitted comments on and protests to MISOs compliance
filing. FirstEnergy submitted comments identifying specific aspects of the
MISOs and Independent Market Monitors proposals for market monitoring and
mitigation and other issues that it believes the FERC should address and
clarify. On October23, 2009, FERC issued an order approving a MISO
compliance filing that revised its tariff to provide for netting of demand
resources, but prohibiting the netting of behind-the-meter
generation.
FES
Sales to Affiliates
FES
supplied all of the power requirements for the Ohio Companies pursuant to a
Power Supply Agreement that ended on December31, 2008. On January2,
2009, FES signed an agreement to provide 75% of the Ohio Companies power
requirements for the period January5, 2009 through March31, 2009.
Subsequently, FES signed an agreement to provide 100% of the Ohio Companies
power requirements for the period April1, 2009 through May31, 2009.
On March4, 2009, the PUCO issued an order approving these two affiliate
sales agreements. FERC authorization for these affiliate sales was by means of a
December23, 2008 waiver of restrictions on affiliate sales without prior
approval of the FERC. Rehearing was denied on July 31, 2009. On October 19,
2009, FERC accepted FirstEnergys revised tariffs.
On May
13-14, 2009, FES participated in a descending clock auction for PLR service
administered by the Ohio Companies and their consultant, CRA International. FES
won 51 tranches in the auction, and entered into a Master SSO Supply Agreement
to provide capacity, energy, ancillary services and transmission to the Ohio
Companies for a two-year period beginning June 1, 2009. Other winning suppliers
have assigned their Master SSO Supply Agreements to FES, five of which were
effective in June, two more in July, four more in August and ten more in
September, 2009. FES also supplies power used by Constellation to serve an
additional five tranches. As a result of these arrangements, FES serves 77
tranches, or 77% of the PLR load of the Ohio Companies.
On
November 3, 2009, FES, Met-Ed, Penelec and Waverly restated their partial
requirements power purchase agreement for 2010. The Fourth Restated Partial
Requirements Agreement PRA continues to limit the amount of capacity resources
required to be supplied by FES to 3,544 MW, but requires FES to supply
essentially all of Met-Ed, Penelec, and Waverlys energy requirements in 2010.
Under the Fourth Restated Partial Requirements Agreement, Met-Ed, Penelec, and
Waverly Buyers assigned 1,300 MW of existing energy purchases to FES to assist
it in supplying Buyers power supply requirements and managing congestion
expenses. FES can either sell theassigned power from the third party into
the market or use it to serve the Met-Ed/Penelec load. FES is responsible for
obtaining additional power supplies in the event of failure of supply of the
assigned energy purchase contracts. Prices for the power sold by FES under the
Fourth Restated Partial Requirements Agreement were increased to $4277 and
$4442, respectively for Met-Ed and Penelec. In addition, FES agreed to
reimburse Met-Ed and Penelec, respectively, for congestion expenses and marginal
losses in excess of $208 million and $79million, respectively, as billed
by PJM in 2010, and associated with delivery of power by FES under the Fourth
Restated Partial Requirements Agreement. The Fourth Restated Partial
Requirements Agreement terminates at the end of 2010.
96
Reliability
Initiatives
In 2005,
Congress amended the Federal Power Act to provide for federally-enforceable
mandatory reliability standards. The mandatory reliability standards apply to
the bulk power system and impose certain operating, record-keeping and reporting
requirements on the Utilities and ATSI. The NERC is charged with establishing
and enforcing these reliability standards, although it has delegated day-to-day
implementation and enforcement of its responsibilities to eight regional
entities, including ReliabilityFirst Corporation. All of FirstEnergys
facilities are located within the ReliabilityFirst region. FirstEnergy actively
participates in the NERC and ReliabilityFirst stakeholder processes, and
otherwise monitors and manages its companies in response to the ongoing
development, implementation and enforcement of the reliability
standards.
FirstEnergy
believes that it is in compliance with all currently-effective and enforceable
reliability standards. Nevertheless, it is clear that the NERC, ReliabilityFirst
and the FERC will continue to refine existing reliability standards as well as
to develop and adopt new reliability standards. The financial impact of
complying with new or amended standards cannot be determined at this time.
However, the 2005 amendments to the Federal Power Act provide that all prudent
costs incurred to comply with the new reliability standards be recovered in
rates. Still, any future inability on FirstEnergys part to comply with the
reliability standards for its bulk power system could result in the imposition
of financial penalties that could have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
In April
2007, ReliabilityFirst performed a routine compliance audit of FirstEnergys
bulk-power system within the Midwest ISO region and found it to be in full
compliance with all audited reliability standards. Similarly, in October 2008,
ReliabilityFirst performed a routine compliance audit of FirstEnergys
bulk-power system within the PJM region and a final report is expected in early
2009. FirstEnergy does not expect any material adverse financial impact as a
result of these audits.
On
December 9, 2008, a transformer at JCPLs Oceanview substation failed,
resulting in an outage on certain bulk electric system transmission voltage
lines out of the Oceanview and Atlantic substations, with customers in the
affected area losing power. Power was restored to most customers within a few
hours and to all customers within eleven hours. On December16, 2008,
JCPL provided preliminary information about the event to certain regulatory
agencies, including the NERC. On March 31, 2009, the NERC initiated a Compliance
Violation Investigation in order to determine JCPLs contribution to the
electrical event and to review any potential violation of NERC Reliability
Standards associated with the event. The initial phase of the investigation
required JCPL to respond to the NERCs request for factual data about the
outage. JCPL submitted its written response on May1, 2009. The NERC
conducted on site interviews with personnel involved in responding to the event
on June 16-17, 2009. On July7, 2009, the NERC issued additional questions
regarding the event and JCPL replied as requested on August6, 2009.
JCPL is not able at this time to predict what actions, if any, that the
NERC may take based on the data submittals or interview results.
On June
5, 2009, FirstEnergy self-reported to ReliabilityFirst a potential violation
of NERC Standard PRC-005 resulting from its inability to validate maintenance
records for 20 protection system relays out of approximately 20,000 reportable
relays in JCPLs and Penelecs transmission systems. These potential
violations were discovered during a comprehensive field review of all
FirstEnergy substations to verify equipment and maintenance database accuracy.
FirstEnergy has completed all mitigation actions, including calibrations and
maintenance records for the relays. ReliabilityFirst issued an Initial
Notice of Alleged Violation on June 22, 2009. The NERC approved FirstEnergys
mitigation plan on August 19, 2009, and submitted it to the FERC for approval on
August 19, 2009. FirstEnergy is not able at this time to predict what actions or
penalties, if any, that ReliabilityFirst will propose for this
self-reported violation.
ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS
Various
federal, state and local authorities regulate FirstEnergy with regard to air and
water quality and other environmental matters. The effects of compliance on
FirstEnergy with regard to environmental matters could have a material adverse
effect on FirstEnergy earnings and competitive position to the extent that it
competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and, therefore,
do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure to comply,
with such regulations.
FirstEnergy
accrues environmental liabilities only when it concludes that it is probable
that it has an obligation for such costs and can reasonably estimate the amount
of such costs. Unasserted claims are reflected in FirstEnergys determination of
environmental liabilities and are accrued in the period that they become both
probable and reasonably estimable.
Clean
Air Act Compliance
FirstEnergy
is required to meet federally-approved SO2 emissions
regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in the shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to $37,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim enforcement policy for
SO2
regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based on a 30-day averaging
period. FirstEnergy believes it is currently in compliance with this policy, but
cannot predict what action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the
interim enforcement policy.
97
FirstEnergy
complies with SO2 reduction
requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 by burning lower-sulfur
fuel, generating more electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using
emission allowances. NOX reductions
required by the 1990 Amendments are being achieved through combustion controls,
the generation of more electricity at lower-emitting plants, and/or using
emission allowances. In September 1998, the EPA finalized regulations requiring
additional NOX reductions
at FirstEnergy facilities. The EPA NOX Transport
Rule imposes uniform reductions of NOX emissions
an approximate 85% reduction in utility plant NOX emissions
from projected 2007 emissions across a region of nineteen states including
Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia based
on a conclusion that such NOX emissions
are contributing significantly to ozone levels in the eastern United States.
FirstEnergy believes its facilities are also complying with the NOX budgets
established under SIPs through combustion controls and post-combustion controls,
including Selective Catalytic Reduction and SNCR systems, and/or using emission
allowances.
In 1999
and 2000, the EPA issued an NOV and the DOJ filed a civil complaint against OE
and Penn based on operation and maintenance of the W. H. Sammis Plant Sammis
NSR Litigation and filed similar complaints involving 44 other U.S. power
plants. This case and seven other similar cases are referred to as the NSR
cases. OEs and Penns settlement with the EPA, the DOJ and three states
Connecticut, New Jersey and New York that resolved all issues related to the
Sammis NSR litigation was approved by the Court on July 11, 2005. This
settlement agreement, in the form of a consent decree, requires reductions of
NOX
and SO2 emissions
at the Sammis, Burger, Eastlake and Mansfield coal-fired plants through the
installation of pollution control devices or repowering and provides for
stipulated penalties for failure to install and operate such pollution controls
or complete repowering in accordance with that agreement. Capital expenditures
necessary to complete requirements of the Sammis NSR Litigation consent decree,
including repowering Burger Units4 and 5 for biomass fuel consumption, are
currently estimated to be $399million for 2010-2012.
In
October 2007, PennFuture and three of its members filed a citizen suit under the
federal CAA, alleging violations of air pollution laws at the Bruce Mansfield
Plant, including opacity limitations, in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Pennsylvania. In July 2008, three additional complaints
were filed against FGCO in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania seeking damages based on Bruce Mansfield Plant air emissions. In
addition to seeking damages, two of the three complaints seek to enjoin the
Bruce Mansfield Plant from operating except in a safe, responsible, prudent and
proper manner, one being a complaint filed on behalf of twenty-one individuals
and the other being a class action complaint, seeking certification as a class
action with the eight named plaintiffs as the class representatives. On October
16, 2009, a settlement reached with PennFuture and one of the three individual
complainants was approved by the Court, which dismissed the claims of PennFuture
and of the settling individual. The other two non-settling individuals are now
represented by counsel handling the three cases filed in July 2008. FGCO
believes those claims are without merit and intends to defend itself against the
allegations made in those three complaints. The Pennsylvania Department of
Health, under a Cooperative Agreement with the Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry, completed a Health Consultation regarding the Mansfield Plant
and issued a report dated March 31, 2009, which concluded there is insufficient
sampling data to determine if any public health threat exists for area residents
due to emissions from the Mansfield Plant. The report recommended additional air
monitoring and sample analysis in the vicinity of the Mansfield Plant, which the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has completed.
In
December 2007, the state of New Jersey filed a CAA citizen suit alleging NSR
violations at the Portland Generation Station against Reliant the current owner
and operator, Sithe Energy the purchaser of the Portland Station from Met-Ed
in 1999, GPU and Met-Ed. On October30, 2008, the state of Connecticut
filed a Motion to Intervene, which the Court granted on March24, 2009.
Specifically, Connecticut and New Jersey allege that modifications at Portland
Units 1 and 2 occurred between 1980 and 2005 without preconstruction NSR or
permitting under the CAA PSD program, and seek injunctive relief, penalties,
attorney fees and mitigation of the harm caused by excess emissions. The scope
of Met-Eds indemnity obligation to and from Sithe Energy is disputed. Met-Ed
filed a Motion to Dismiss the claims in New Jerseys Amended Complaint and
Connecticuts Complaint in Februaryand Septemberof 2009,
respectively. The Court granted Met-Ed motion to dismiss New Jerseys and
Connecticuts claims for injunctive relief against Met-Ed, but denied Met-Eds
motion to dismiss the claims for civil penalties on statute of limitations
grounds in order to allow the states to prove either that the application of the
discovery rule or the doctrine of equitable tolling bars application of the
statute of limitations.
In
January2009, the EPA issued a NOV to Reliant alleging NSR violations at
the Portland Generation Station based on modifications dating back to 1986.
Met-Ed is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. The EPAs
January2009, NOV also alleged NSR violations at the Keystone and Shawville
Stations based on modifications dating back to 1984. JCPL, as the former
owner of 1667% of the Keystone Station, and Penelec, as former owner and
operator of the Shawville Station, are unable to predict the outcome of this
matter.
In June
2008, the EPA issued a Notice and Finding of Violation to Mission Energy
Westside, Inc. alleging that modifications at the Homer City Power Station
occurred since 1988 to the present without preconstruction NSR or permitting
under the CAA PSD program. Mission Energy is seeking indemnification from
Penelec, the co-owner along with New York State Electric and Gas Company and
operator of the Homer City Power Station prior to its sale in 1999. The scope of
Penelecs indemnity obligation to and from Mission Energy is disputed. Penelec
is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
98
In
August 2009, the EPA issued a Finding of Violation and NOV alleging violations
of the CAA and Ohio regulations, including the PSD, NNSR, and Title V
regulations at the Eastlake, Lakeshore, Bay Shore, and Ashtabula generating
plants. The EPAs NOV alleges equipment replacements occurring during
maintenance outages dating back to 1990 triggered the pre-construction
permitting requirements under the PSD and NNSR programs. In September2009,
FGCO received an information request pursuant to Section 114a of the CAA
requesting certain operating and maintenance information and planning
information regarding the Eastlake, Lake Shore, Bay Shore and Ashtabula
generating plants. On November3, 2009, FGCO received a letter providing
notification that the EPA is evaluating whether certain scheduled
maintenanceat the Eastlake generating plant may constitute a major
modification under the NSR provision of the CAA. On December 23, 2009, FGCO
received another information request regarding emission projections for the
Eastlake generating plant pursuant to Section 114a of the CAA. FGCO intends to
comply with the CAA, including EPAs information requests, but, at this time, is
unable to predict the outcome of this matter. A June2006 finding of
violation and NOV in which EPA alleged CAA violations at the Bay Shore
Generating Plant remains unresolved and FGCO is unable to predict the outcome of
such matter.
In
August 2008, FirstEnergy received a request from the EPA for information
pursuant to Section 114a of the CAA for certain operating and maintenance
information regarding its formerly-owned Avon Lake and Niles generating plants,
as well as a copy of a nearly identical request directed to the current owner,
Reliant Energy, to allow the EPA to determine whether these generating sources
are complying with the NSR provisions of the CAA. FirstEnergy intends to fully
comply with the EPAs information request, but, at this time, is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter.
National
Ambient Air Quality Standards
In
March2005, the EPA finalized CAIR, covering a total of 28 states
including Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania and the District of
Columbia, based on proposed findings that air emissions from 28 eastern states
and the District of Columbia significantly contribute to non-attainment of the
NAAQS for fine particles and/or the 8-hour ozone NAAQS in other states. CAIR
requires reductions of NOX and
SO2
emissions in two phases Phase I in 2009 for NOX, 2010 for
SO2
and Phase II in 2015 for both NOX and
SO2,
ultimately capping SO2 emissions
in affected states to 25million tons annually and NOX emissions
to 13 million tons annually. CAIR was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia and on July 11, 2008, the Court vacated CAIR in
its entirety and directed the EPA to redo its analysis from the ground up. In
September 2008, the EPA, utility, mining and certain environmental advocacy
organizations petitioned the Court for a rehearing to reconsider its ruling
vacating CAIR. In December 2008, the Court reconsidered its prior ruling and
allowed CAIR to remain in effect to temporarily preserve its environmental
values until the EPA replaces CAIR with a new rule consistent with the Courts
July 11, 2008 opinion. On July 10, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled in a different case that a cap-and-trade program
similar to CAIR, called the NOX SIP Call,
cannot be used to satisfy certain CAA requirements known as reasonably
available control technology for areas in non-attainment under the 8-hour
ozone NAAQS. FGCO future cost of compliance with these regulations may be
substantial and will depend, in part, on the action taken by the EPA in response
to the Courts ruling.
Mercury
Emissions
In
December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the development of
regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric power plants,
identifying mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of greatest concern. In March
2005, the EPA finalized the CAMR, which provides a cap-and-trade program to
reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants in two phases; initially,
capping national mercury emissions at 38tons by 2010 as a co-benefit
from implementation of SO2 and
NOX
emission caps under the EPA CAIR program and 15 tons per year by 2018.
Several states and environmental groups appealed the CAMR to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia. On February8, 2008, the Court
vacated the CAMR, ruling that the EPA failed to take the necessary steps to
de-list coal-fired power plants from its hazardous air pollutant program and,
therefore, could not promulgate a cap-and-trade program. The EPA petitioned for
rehearing by the entire Court, which denied the petition in May 2008. In
October2008, the EPA and an industry group petitioned the U.S. Supreme
Court for review of the Courts ruling vacating CAMR. On February6, 2009,
the EPA moved to dismiss its petition for certiorari. On February 23, 2009, the
Supreme Court dismissed the EPAs petition and denied the industry groups
petition. On October21, 2009, the EPA opened a 30-day comment period on a
proposed consent decree that would obligate the EPA to propose MACT regulations
for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by March16, 2011, and to
finalize the regulations by November16, 2011. FGCOs future cost of
compliance withMACT regulations may be substantial and will depend on the
action taken by the EPA and on how any future regulations are ultimately
implemented.
Pennsylvania
has submitted a new mercury rule for EPA approval that does not provide a
cap-and-trade approach as in the CAMR, but rather follows a command-and-control
approach imposing emission limits on individual sources. On December 23, 2009,
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania ruling that Pennsylvanias mercury rule is unlawful, invalid and
unenforceable and enjoined the Commonwealth from continued implementation or
enforcement of that rule.
99
Climate
Change
In
December 1997, delegates to the United Nations' climate summit in Japan adopted
an agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, to address global warming by reducing, by
2012, the amount of man-made GHG, including CO2, emitted
by developed countries. The United States signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 but
it was never submitted for ratification by the United States Senate. The EPACT
established a Committee on Climate Change Technology to coordinate federal
climate change activities and promote the development and deployment of GHG
reducing technologies. President Obama has announced his Administrations New
Energy for America Plan that includes, among other provisions, ensuring that
10% of electricity used in the United States comes from renewable sources by
2012, increasing to 25% by 2025, and implementing an economy-wide cap-and-trade
program to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050.
There
are a number of initiatives to reduce GHG emissions under consideration at the
federal, state and international level. At the international level, the December
2009 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen did not reach a
consensuson a successor treatyto the Kyoto Protocol, but did take
note of the Copenhagen Accord, a non-binding political agreement
whichrecognized the scientific view that the increase in global
temperature should be belowtwo degrees Celsius,included a commitment
by developed countries to providefunds, approaching$30
billionover the next three years with a goal of increasing to
$100billion by 2020, and established the Copenhagen GreenClimate
Fund to support mitigation, adaptation, and other climate-related activities in
developing countries. Once they have become a party to the Copenhagen Accord,
developed economies, such as the European Union, Japan, Russia, and the United
States, would commit to quantified economy-wide emissions targets from 2020,
while developing countries, including Brazil, China, and India, would agree to
take mitigation actions, subject to their domestic measurement, reporting, and
verification. At the federal level, members of Congress have introduced several
bills seeking to reduce emissions of GHG in the United States, and the House of
Representatives passed one such bill, the American Clean Energy and Security Act
of 2009, on June26, 2009. The Senate continues to consider a number of
measures to regulate GHG emissions. State activities, primarily the northeastern
states participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and western
states, led by California, have coordinated efforts to develop regional
strategies to control emissions of certain GHGs.
On April
2, 2007, the United States Supreme Court found that the EPA has the authority to
regulate CO2 emissions
from automobiles as air pollutants under the CAA. Although this decision did
not address CO2 emissions
from electric generating plants, the EPA has similar authority under the CAA to
regulate air pollutants from those and other facilities. In
December2009, the EPA released its final Endangerment and Cause or
Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under the Clean Air Act. The EPAs
finding concludes that the atmospheric concentrations of several key GHG
threaten the health and welfare of future generations and that the combined
emissions of these gases by motor vehicles contribute to the atmospheric
concentrations of these key GHG and hence to the threat of climate change.
Although the EPAs finding does not establish emission requirements for motor
vehicles, such requirements are expected to occur through further rulemakings.
Additionally, while the EPAs endangerment findings do not specifically address
stationary sources, including electric generating plantsEPAs
expected establishment of emission requirements for motor vehicles would be
expected to support the establishment of future emission requirements by the EPA
for stationary sources. In September 2009, the EPA finalized a national GHG
emissions collection and reporting rule that will require FirstEnergy to measure
GHG emissions commencing in 2010 and submit reports commencing in 2011. Also in
September 2009, EPA proposed new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when
CAA permits under the NSR and Title V operating permits programs would be
required. EPA is proposing a major source emissions applicability threshold of
25,000 tons per year tpy of carbon dioxide equivalents CO2e for existing
facilities under the Title V operating permits program and the Prevention of
Significant Determination PSD portion of NSR. EPA is also proposing a
significance level between 10,000 and 25,000 tpy CO2e to determine if existing
major sources making modifications that result in an increase of emissions above
the significance level would be required to obtain a PSD permit.
On
September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and on
October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, reversed and
remanded lower court decisions that had dismissed complaints alleging damage
from GHG emissions on jurisdictional grounds. These cases involve common law
tort claims, including public and private nuisance, alleging that GHG emissions
contribute to global warming and result in property damages. While FirstEnergy
is not a party to either litigation, should the courts of appeals decisions be
affirmed or not subjected to further review, FirstEnergy and/or one or more of
its subsidiaries could be named in actions making similar
allegations.
FirstEnergy
cannot currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies,
although potential legislative or regulatory programs restricting CO2 emissions,
or litigation alleging damages from GHG emissions, could require significant
capital and other expenditures or result in changes to its operations. The
CO2
emissions per KWH of electricity generated by FirstEnergy is lower than many
regional competitors due to its diversified generation sources, which include
low or non-CO2 emitting
gas-fired and nuclear generators.
Clean
Water Act
Various
water quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of the federal
Clean Water Act and its amendments, apply to FirstEnergy plants. In addition,
Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have water quality standards applicable to
FirstEnergy operations. As provided in the Clean Water Act, authority to grant
federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System water discharge permits
can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have assumed such
authority.
100
On
September7, 2004, the EPA established new performance standards under
Section 316b of the Clean Water Act for reducing impacts on fish and shellfish
from cooling water intake structures at certain existing large electric
generating plants. The regulations call for reductions in impingement mortality
when aquatic organisms are pinned against screens or other parts of a cooling
water intake system and entrainment which occurs when aquatic life is drawn
into a facility cooling water system. On January 26, 2007, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit remanded portions of the rulemaking
dealing with impingement mortality and entrainment back to the EPA for further
rulemaking and eliminated the restoration option from the EPAs regulations. On
July 9, 2007, the EPA suspended this rule, noting that until further rulemaking
occurs, permitting authorities should continue the existing practice of applying
their best professional judgment to minimize impacts on fish and shellfish from
cooling water intake structures. On April1, 2009, the Supreme Court of the
United States reversed one significant aspect of the Second Circuit Courts
opinion and decided that Section316b of the Clean Water Act authorizes
the EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology
available for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake
structures. EPA is developing a new regulation under Section 316b of the Clean
Water Act consistent with the opinions of the Supreme Court and the Court of
Appeals which have created significant uncertainty about the specific nature,
scope and timing of the final performance standard. FirstEnergy is studying
various control options and their costs and effectiveness. Depending on the
results of such studies and the EPAs further rulemaking and any action taken by
the states exercising best professional judgment, the future costs of compliance
with these standards may require material capital expenditures.
The U.S.
Attorney Office in Cleveland, Ohio has advised FGCO that it is considering
prosecution under the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for
three petroleum spills at the Edgewater, Lakeshore and Bay Shore plants which
occurred on November1, 2005, January 26, 2007 and February27, 2007.
FGCO is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
Regulation
of Waste Disposal
As a
result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, and
the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state hazardous waste
regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel combustion waste
products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste disposal
requirements pending the EPA evaluation of the need for future regulation. In
February 2009, the EPA requested comments from the states on options for
regulating coal combustion wastes, including regulation as non-hazardous waste
or regulation as a hazardous waste. In March and June 2009, the EPA requested
information from FGCOs Bruce Mansfield Plant regarding the management of coal
combustion wastes. In December 2009, EPA provided to FGCO the findings of its
review of the Bruce Mansfield Plants coal combustion waste management
practices.EPA observed that the waste management structures and the
Plant appeared to be well maintained and in good working order and recommended
only that FGCO seal and maintain all asphalt surfaces. On December 30, 2009,
in an advanced notice of public rulemaking, the EPA said that the large volumes
of coal combustion residuals produced by electric utilities pose significant
financial risk to the industry.Additional regulations of fossil-fuel
combustion waste products could have a significant impact on our management,
beneficial use, and disposal, of coal ash. FGCO future cost of compliance with
any coal combustion waste regulations which may be promulgated could be
substantial and would depend, in part, on the regulatory action taken by the EPA
and implementation by the states.
The
Utilities have been named as potentially responsible parties at waste disposal
sites, which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of hazardous
substances at historical sites and the liability involved are often
unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however, federal law provides that all
potentially responsible parties for a particular site may be liable on a joint
and several basis. Environmental liabilities that are considered probable have
been recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, based
on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, the Utilities' proportionate
responsibility for such costs and the financial ability of other unaffiliated
entities to pay. Total liabilities of approximately $101million JCPL
- - $74million, TE - $1million, CEI - $1million, FGCO 1million and FirstEnergy - $24million have been accrued through
December 31, 2009. Included in the total are accrued liabilities of
approximately $67million for environmental remediation of former
manufactured gas plants and gas holder facilities in New Jersey, which are being
recovered by JCPL through a non-bypassable SBC.
OTHER
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Power
Outages and Related Litigation
In July
1999, the Mid-Atlantic States experienced a severe heat wave, which resulted in
power outages throughout the service territories of many electric utilities,
including JCPL territory. Two class action lawsuits subsequently
consolidated into a single proceeding were filed in New Jersey Superior Court
in July 1999 against JCPL, GPU and other GPU companies, seeking
compensatory and punitive damages due to the outages.
101
After
various motions, rulings and appeals, the Plaintiffs' claims for consumer fraud,
common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, strict product liability, and
punitive damages were dismissed, leaving only the negligence and breach of
contract causes of actions. The class was decertified twice by the trial court,
and appealed both times by the Plaintiffs, with the results being that: 1 the
Appellate Division limited the class only to those customers directly impacted
by the outages of JCPL transformers in Red Bank, NJ, based on a common
incident involving the failure of the bushings of two large transformers in the
Red Bank substation which resulted in planned and unplanned outages in the area
during a 2-3 day period, and 2 in March 2007, the Appellate Division remanded
this matter back to the Trial Court to allow plaintiffs sufficient time to
establish a damage model or individual proof of damages. On March 31, 2009, the
trial court again granted JCPLs motion to decertify the class. On April
20, 2009, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to take an interlocutory
appeal to the trial court decision to decertify the class, which was granted
by the Appellate Division on June 15, 2009. Plaintiffs filed their appellate
brief on August 25, 2009, and JCPL filed an opposition brief on
September25, 2009. On or about October13, 2009, Plaintiffs filed
their reply brief in further support of their appeal of the trial court
decision decertifying the class. The Appellate Division heard oral argument on
January5, 2010, before a three-judge panel. JCPL is awaiting the
Courts decision.
Nuclear
Plant Matters
In
August 2007, FENOC submitted an application to the NRC to renew the operating
licenses for the Beaver Valley Power Station Units 1 and 2 for an additional
20 years. On November5, 2009, the NRC issued a renewed operating license
for Beaver Valley Power Station, Units 1 and 2. The operating licenses for these
facilities were extended until 2036 and 2047 for Units 1 and 2,
respectively.
Under
NRC regulations, FirstEnergy must ensure that adequate funds will be available
to decommission its nuclear facilities. As of December31, 2009,
FirstEnergy had approximately $19billion invested in external trusts to
be used for the decommissioning and environmental remediation of Davis-Besse,
Beaver Valley, Perry and TMI-2. As part of the application to the NRC to
transfer the ownership of Davis-Besse, Beaver Valley and Perry to NGC in 2005,
FirstEnergy provided an additional $80 million parental guarantee associated
with the funding of decommissioning costs for these units and indicated that it
planned to contribute an additional $80 million to these trusts by 2010. As
required by the NRC, FirstEnergy annually recalculates and adjusts the amount of
its parental guarantee, as appropriate. The values of FirstEnergys nuclear
decommissioning trusts fluctuate based on market conditions. If the value of the
trusts decline by a material amount, FirstEnergys obligation to fund the trusts
may increase. Disruptions in the capital markets and its effects on particular
businesses and the economy in general also affects the values of the nuclear
decommissioning trusts. On June 18, 2009, the NRC informed FENOC that its review
tentatively concluded that a shortfall existed in the decommissioning trust fund
for Beaver Valley Unit 1. On November 24, 2009, FENOC submitted a revised
decommissioning funding calculation using the NRC formula method based on the
renewed license for Beaver Valley Unit 1, which extended operations until 2036.
FENOCs submittal demonstrated that there was a de minimis shortfall. On
December11, 2009, the NRCs review of FirstEnergys methodology for the
funding of decommissioning of this facility concluded that there was reasonable
assurance of adequate decommissioning funding at the time permanent termination
of operations is expected. FirstEnergy continues to evaluate the status of its
funding obligations for the decommissioning of these nuclear
facilities.
Other
Legal Matters
There
are various lawsuits, claims including claims for asbestos exposure and
proceedings related to FirstEnergy normal business operations pending against
FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries. The other potentially material items not
otherwise discussed above are described below.
JCPL
bargaining unit employees filed a grievance challenging JCPL 2002
call-out procedure that required bargaining unit employees to respond to
emergency power outages. On May20, 2004, an arbitration panel concluded
that the call-out procedure violated the parties' collective bargaining
agreement. On September9, 2005, the arbitration panel issued an opinion to
award approximately $16 million to the bargaining unit employees. A final order
identifying the individual damage amounts was issued on October31, 2007
and the award appeal process was initiated. The union filed a motion with the
federal Court to confirm the award and JCPL filed its answer and
counterclaim to vacate the award on December31, 2007. JCPL and the
union filed briefs in June and July of 2008 and oral arguments were held in the
fall. On February25, 2009, the federal district court denied JCPLs
motion to vacate the arbitration decision and granted the unions motion to
confirm the award. JCPL filed a Notice of Appeal to the Third Circuit and a
Motion to Stay Enforcement of the Judgment on March6, 2009. The appeal
process could take as long as 24 months. The parties are participating in the
federal court mediation programs and have held private settlement discussions.
JCPL recognized a liability for the potential $16million award in
2005. Post-judgment interest began to accrue as of February 25, 2009, and the
liability will be adjusted accordingly.
FirstEnergy
accrues legal liabilities only when it concludes that it is probable that it has
an obligation for such costs and can reasonably estimate the amount of such
costs. If it were ultimately determined that FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries
have legal liability or are otherwise made subject to liability based on the
above matters, it could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy or its
subsidiaries' financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.
102
CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP.
Application of these principles often requires a high degree of judgment,
estimates and assumptions that affect financial results. All of our assets are
subject to their own specific risks and uncertainties and are regularly reviewed
for impairment. Our more significant accounting policies are described
below.
Revenue
Recognition
We
follow the accrual method of accounting for revenues, recognizing revenue for
electricity that has been delivered to customers but not yet billed through the
end of the accounting period. The determination of electricity sales to
individual customers is based on meter readings, which occur on a systematic
basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, electricity delivered to
customers since the last meter reading is estimated and a corresponding accrual
for unbilled sales is recognized. The determination of unbilled sales requires
management to make estimates regarding electricity available for retail load,
transmission and distribution line losses, demand by customer class,
weather-related impacts and prices in effect for each customer
class.
Regulatory
Accounting
Our
energy delivery services segment is subject to regulation that sets the prices
rates we are permitted to charge our customers based on costs that the
regulatory agencies determine we are permitted to recover. At times, regulators
permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently
charged to expense by an unregulated company. This ratemaking process results in
the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows. We
regularly review these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the
approved regulatory guidelines. Impairment risk associated with these assets
relates to potentially adverse legislative, judicial or regulatory actions in
the future.
Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefits Accounting
Our
reported costs of providing noncontributory qualified and non-qualified defined
pension benefits and OPEB benefits other than pensions are dependent upon
numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and certain
assumptions.
Pension
and OPEB costs are affected by employee demographics including age,
compensation levels, and employment periods, the level of contributions we make
to the plans and earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be
affected by changes to key assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on
plan assets, the discount rates and health care trend rates used in determining
the projected benefit obligations for pension and OPEB costs.
In
accordance with GAAP, changes in pension and OPEB obligations associated with
these factors may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income
statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining
average service period of plan participants. GAAP delays recognition of changes
due to the long-term nature of pension and OPEB obligations and the varying
market conditions likely to occur over long periods of time. As such,
significant portions of pension and OPEB costs recorded in any period may not
reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants and are
significantly influenced by assumptions about future market conditions and plan
participants' experience.
We
recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension
and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet and recognize
changes in funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other
comprehensive income. The underfunded status of our qualified and non-qualified
pension and OPEB plans at December31, 2009 is $13 billion.
In
selecting an assumed discount rate, we consider currently available rates of
return on high-quality fixed income investments expected to be available during
the period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefit
obligations. As of December 31, 2009, the assumed discount rates for pension and
OPEB were 60% and 575%, respectively. The assumed discount rates for both
pension and OPEB were 70% and 65% as of December31, 2008, and 2007,
respectively.
Our
assumed rate of return on pension plan assets considers historical market
returns and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by our pension
trusts. In 2009 our qualified pension and OPEB plan assets actually earned
$570million or 136% and lost $14 billion or 238% in 2008. Our qualified
pension and OPEB costs in 2009 and 2008 were computed using an assumed 90% rate
of return on plan assets which generated $379million and $514million
of expected returns on plan assets, respectively. The expected return of pension
and OPEB assets is based on the trusts asset allocation targets and the
historical performance of risk-based and fixed income securities. The gains or
losses generated as a result of the difference between expected and actual
returns on plan assets are deferred and amortized and will increase or decrease
future net periodic pension and OPEB cost, respectively.
103
Our
qualified and non-qualified pension and OPEB net periodic benefit cost was
$197million in 2009 compared to credits of $116million in 2008 and
$73million in 2007. On September 2, 2009, the Utilities and ATSI made a
combined $500 million voluntary contribution to their qualified pension plan.
Due to the significance of the voluntary contribution, we elected to remeasure
our qualified pension plan as of August 31, 2009. On January 2, 2007, we made a
$300 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan. In addition, during
2006, we amended our OPEB plan, effective in 2008, to cap our monthly
contribution for many of the retirees and their spouses receiving subsidized
health care coverage. On June 2, 2009, we further amended our health care
benefits plan for all employees and retirees eligible that participate in that
plan. The amendment, which reduces future health care coverage subsidies paid by
FirstEnergy on behalf of participants, triggered a remeasurement of
FirstEnergys other postretirement benefit plans as of May 31, 2009. In the
third quarter of 2009, FirstEnergy also incurred a $13 million net
postretirement benefit cost including amounts capitalized related to a
liability created by the VERO offered by FirstEnergy to qualified employees. The
special termination benefits of the VERO included additional health care
coverage subsidies paid by FirstEnergy to those qualified employees who elected
to retire. A total of 715 employees accepted the VERO. We expect our 2010
qualified and non-qualified pension and OPEB costs including amounts
capitalized to be $138million.
Health
care cost trends continue to increase and will affect future OPEB costs. The
2009 and 2008 composite health care trend rate assumptions were approximately
85-10% and 9-11%, respectively, gradually decreasing to 5% in later years. In
determining our trend rate assumptions, we included the specific provisions of
our health care plans, the demographics and utilization rates of plan
participants, actual cost increases experienced in our health care plans, and
projections of future medical trend rates. The effect on our pension and OPEB
costs from changes in key assumptions are as follows:

Emission
Allowances
We hold
emission allowances for SO2 and
NOX in
order to comply with programs implemented by the EPA designed to regulate
emissions of SO2 and
NOX
produced by power plants. Emission allowances are either granted to us by the
EPA at zero cost or are purchased at fair value as needed to meet emission
requirements.Emission allowances are not purchased with the intent
of resale. Emission allowances eligible to be used in the current year are
recorded in materials and supplies inventory at the lesser of weighted average
cost or market value. Emission allowances eligible for use in future years are
recorded as other investments. We recognize emission allowance costs as fuel
expense during the periods that emissions are produced by our generating
facilities.Excess emission allowances that are not needed to meet
emission requirements may be sold and are reported as a reduction to other
operating expenses.
Long-Lived
Assets
We
review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be
recoverable.
The recoverability of a long-lived asset is measured by comparing the
assets carrying value to the sum of undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the
carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows of the
long-lived asset an impairment exists and a loss is recognized for the amount by
which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair
value.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date.
Asset
Retirement Obligations
We
recognize an ARO for the future decommissioning of our nuclear power plants and
future remediation of other environmental liabilities associated with all of our
long-lived assets. The ARO liability represents an estimate of the fair value of
our current obligation related to nuclear decommissioning and the retirement or
remediation of environmental liabilities of other assets. A fair value
measurement inherently involves uncertainty in the amount and timing of
settlement of the liability. We use an expected cash flow approach to measure
the fair value of the nuclear decommissioning and environmental remediation ARO.
This approach applies probability weighting to discounted future cash flow
scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes. The scenarios consider
settlement of the ARO at the expiration of the nuclear power plants' current
license and settlement based on an extended license term and expected
remediation dates.
104
Income
Taxes
We
record income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts recognized for tax purposes. Investment tax credits,
which were deferred when utilized, are being amortized over the recovery period
of the related property. Deferred income tax liabilities related to tax and
accounting basis differences and tax credit carryforward items are recognized at
the statutory income tax rates in effect when the liabilities are expected to be
paid. Deferred tax assets are recognized based on income tax rates expected to
be in effect when they are settled.
FirstEnergy
accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its financial statements.
We account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model
with a two-step approach, a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a
measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being ultimately realized upon
ultimate settlement. If it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be
sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax
positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return
are considered to have met the recognition threshold. The Company recognizes
interest expense or income related to uncertain tax positions. That amount is
computed by applying the applicable statutory interest rate to the difference
between the tax position recognized and the amount previously taken or expected
to be taken on the tax return. FirstEnergy includes net interest and penalties
in the provision for income taxes.
Goodwill
In a
business combination, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill.
Based on the guidance provided by accounting standards for the recognition,
subsequent measurement, and subsequent recognition of goodwill, we evaluate
goodwill for impairment at least annually and make such evaluations more
frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In accordance with the accounting
standard, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value
including goodwill, the goodwill is tested for impairment. If impairment is
indicated, we recognize a loss calculated as the difference between the

NEW
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS
In 2009,
the FASB amended the derecognition guidance in the Transfers and Servicing Topic
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and eliminated the concept of a
QSPE. The amended guidance requires an evaluation of all existing QSPEs to
determine whether they must be consolidated. This standard is effective for
financial asset transfers that occur in fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2009. FirstEnergy does not expect this standard to have a
material effect upon its financial statements.
In 2009,
the FASB amended the consolidation guidance applied to VIEs. This standard
replaces the quantitative approach previously required to determine which entity
has a controlling financial interest in a VIE with a qualitative approach. Under
the new approach, the primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both
a the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact
the entitys economic performance, and b the obligation to absorb losses of
the entity, or the right to receive benefits from the entity, that could be
significant to the VIE. This standard also requires ongoing reassessments of
whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and enhanced disclosures
about an entitys involvement in VIEs. The standard is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November15, 2009. FirstEnergy does not expect this
standard to have a material effect upon its financial statements.
In 2010,
the FASB amended the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification to require additional disclosures about 1
transfers of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, including the reason
for transfers, 2 purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll
forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, 3 additional
disaggregation to include fair value measurement disclosures for each class of
assets and liabilities and 4 disclosure of inputs and valuation techniques used
to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value
measurements.The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales,
issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value
measurements, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2010.FirstEnergy does not expect this standard to have a material
effect upon its financial statements.

NARRATIVE
ANALYSIS
OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FES is a
wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy. FES provides energy-related products and
services, and through its subsidiaries, FGCO and NGC, owns or leases and
operates and maintains FirstEnergy fossil and hydroelectric generation
facilities, and owns FirstEnergy nuclear generation facilities, respectively.
FENOC, a wholly owned subsidiary of FirstEnergy, operates and maintains the
nuclear generating facilities.
`
FES'
revenues have been primarily derived from the sale of electricity provided from
FES' generating facilities and through purchased power arrangements to
affiliated utility companies to meet all or a portion of their PLR and default
service requirements. These affiliated power sales included a full-requirements
PSA with OE, CEI and TE to supply each of their default service obligations
through December31, 2008, at prices that considered their respective
PUCO-authorized billing rates. See Regulatory Matters Ohio in the Combined
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of Ohio power
supply procurement issues for 2009 and beyond. On November3, 2009, FES,
Met-Ed, Penelec and Waverly restated their partial requirements power purchase
agreement for 2010. Under the new agreement, Met-Ed, Penelec, and Waverly
assigned 1,300MW of existing energy purchases to FES to assist it in
supplying buyers power supply requirements and managing congestion expenses.
FES can either sell the assigned power from the third party into the market or
use it to serve the Met-Ed/Penelec load. FES is responsible for obtaining
additional power supplies in the event of failure of supply of the assigned
energy purchase contracts. FES also supplied, through May31, 2009, a
portion of Penn default service requirements at market-based rates as a result
of Penn 2008 competitive solicitations. FES' revenues also include competitive
retail and wholesale sales to non-affiliated customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan and Illinois. These sales may provide a greater
portion of revenues in future years, depending upon FES' participation in its
Ohio and Pennsylvania utility affiliates' power procurement
arrangements.
The
demand for electricity produced and sold by FES, along with the price of that
electricity, is impacted by conditions in competitive power markets, global
economic activity, economic activity in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions,
and weather conditions in FirstEnergys service territories. The 2009
recessionary economic conditions, particularly in the automotive and steel
industries, compounded by unusually mild regional summertime temperatures, have
adversely affected FES operations and revenues.
The
level of demand for electricity directly impacts FES generation revenues, the
quantity of electricity produced, purchased power expense and fuel expense.
FirstEnergy and FES have taken various actions and instituted a number of
changes in operating practices to manage the impact of these external
influences. These actions include employee severances, wage reductions, employee
and retiree benefit changes, reduced levels of overtime and the use of fewer
contractors. The continuation of recessionary economic conditions, coupled with
unusually mild weather patterns and the resulting impact on electricity prices
and demand, could impact FES future operating performance and financial
condition and may require further changes in FES operations.

additional information with respect to FES, please see the information contained
in FirstEnergy Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of
Operations
Net
income increased to $577million in 2009 from $506 million in 2008
primarily due to higher revenues principally from the sale of a participation
interest in OVEC, lower fuel expense and increased investment income, partially
offset by higher purchased power, including a $205 million mark-to-market charge
related to certain purchased power contracts, and other operating
expenses.
Revenues
Revenues
increased by $210million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to
increases in revenues from retail generation sales and FGCOs gain from the sale
of a 9% participation interest in OVEC, partially offset by lower affiliated
wholesale generation sales and decreased transmission revenues. The increase in
revenues in 2009 from 2008 is summarized below:

The
increase in non-affiliated retail revenues of $163 million resulted from
increased revenue in both the PJM and MISO markets. The increase in MISO retail
revenue is primarily the result of the acquisition of new customers, higher unit
prices and the inclusion of the transmission-related component in retail prices
in Ohio beginning in June 2009. The increase in PJM retail revenue resulted from
the acquisition of new customers, higher sales volumes and unit prices. The
acquisition of new customers is primarily due to new government aggregation
contracts with 60 area communities in Ohio that will provide discounted
generation prices to approximately 580,000 residential and small commercial
customers. Lower non-affiliated wholesale revenues of $49 million resulted from
decreased sales volumes in PJM partially offset by increased capacity prices,
increased sales volumes in MISO, and favorable settlements on hedged
transactions.
The
lower affiliated company wholesale generation revenues of $125million were
due to lower sales volumes to the Ohio Companies combined with lower unit prices
to the Pennsylvania Companies, partially offset by higher unit prices to the
Ohio Companies and increased sales volumes to the Pennsylvania Companies. The
lower sales volumes and higher unit prices to the Ohio Companies reflected the
results of the power procurement processes in the first half of 2009 see
Regulatory Matters Ohio. The higher sales to the Pennsylvania Companies were
due to increased Met-Ed and Penelec generation sales requirements supplied by
FES partially offset by lower sales to Penn due to decreased default service
requirements in 2009 compared to 2008. Additionally, while unit prices for each
of the Pennsylvania Companies did not change, the mix of sales among the
companies caused the overall price to decline.

revenues decreased $77million due primarily to reduced loads following the
expiration of the government aggregation programs in Ohio at the end of 2008. In
2009 FGCO sold a 9% participation interest in OVEC resulting in a $252 million
$158 million, after tax gain. Other revenue increased $46million
primarily due to rental income associated with NGC acquisition of equity
interests in the Perry and Beaver Valley Unit 2 leases.

$
151
Fuel
costs decreased $188million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily resulting
from decreased coal consumption, reflecting lower generation, offset by higher
unit prices due to increased fuel costs associated with purchases of eastern
coal. Nuclear fuel costs increased slightly due to increased unit prices in 2009
compared to 2008.
Purchased
power costs from non-affiliates increased primarily as a result of a
mark-to-market charge of $205million related to certain purchased power
contracts see Note 6 and increased capacity costs, partially offset by reduced
volume requirements. Purchases from affiliated companies increased as a result
of increased unit costs, partially offset by lower volume
requirements.
Other
operating expenses increased $99million in 2009 compared
to 2008 primarily due to increased transmission expenses reflecting TSC related
to the load serving entity obligations in MISO and increased net congestion and
transmission loss expenses in MISO and PJM. Also contributing to the increase
was higher employee benefit expenses and higher nuclear operating costs
associated with an additional refueling outage in 2009 compared to 2008. These
increases were partially offset by increased intercompany billings and lower
fossil operating costs primarily due to a reduction in contractor, material, and
labor costs, combined with more resources dedicated to capital
projects.
Depreciation
expense increased by $27million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to
NGCs increased ownership interest in Beaver Valley Unit 2 and
Perry.
Other
Income Expense
Other
income of $40 million in 2009 compared to other expense of $119 million in 2008,
resulted primarily from a $155million increase from gains on the sale of
nuclear decommissioning trust investments. During 2009, the majority of the
nuclear decommissioning trust holdings were converted to more closely align with
the liability being funded.
Market Risk
Information
FES uses
various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative contracts,
primarily to manage the risk of price and interest rate fluctuations.
FirstEnergys Risk Policy Committee, comprised of members of senior management,
provides general oversight to risk management activities.
108
Commodity
Price Risk
FES is
exposed to financial and market risks resulting from the fluctuation of interest
rates and commodity prices primarily due to fluctuations in electricity, energy
transmission, natural gas, coal, nuclear fuel and emission allowance prices. To
manage the volatility relating to these exposures, FES uses a variety of
non-derivative and derivative instruments, including forward contracts, options,
futures contracts and swaps. The derivatives are used principally for hedging
purposes. Certain derivatives must be recorded at their fair value and marked to
market. The majority of FES derivative contracts qualify for the normal
purchase and normal sale exception and are therefore excluded from the table
below. Contracts that are not exempt from such treatment include certain
purchased power contracts modified to financially settle as FES determined that
projected short positions in 2010 and 2011 were not expected to materialize
based on reductions in PLR obligations and decreased demand due to economic
conditions $205million. The change in the fair value of commodity
derivative contracts related to energy production during 2009 is summarized in

FES
performs sensitivity analyses to estimate its exposure to the market risk of its
commodity positions. A hypothetical 10% adverse shift an increase or decrease
depending on the derivative position in quoted market prices in the near term
on FES derivative instruments would not have had a material effect on its
consolidated financial position assets, liabilities and equity or cash flows
as of December31, 2009. Based on derivative contracts held as of
December31, 2009, an adverse 10% change in commodity prices would decrease
net income by approximately $9million for the next

Fluctuations
in the fair value of NGC decommissioning trust balances will eventually affect
earnings immediately for other-than-temporary impairments and affecting OCI
initially for unrealized gains based on authoritative guidance. As of
December31, 2009, NGCs decommissioning trust balance totaled
$11billion, comprised primarily of debt instruments.
Credit
Risk
Credit
risk is the risk of an obligor failure to meet the terms of any investment
contract, loan agreement or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk arises from
all activities in which success depends on issuer, borrower or counterparty
performance, whether reflected on or off the balance sheet. FES engages in
transactions for the purchase and sale of commodities including gas,
electricity, coal and emission allowances. These transactions are often with
major energy companies within the industry.
FES
maintains credit policies with respect to our counterparties to manage overall
credit risk. This includes performing independent risk evaluations, actively
monitoring portfolio trends and using collateral and contract provisions to
mitigate exposure. As part of its credit program, FES aggressively manages the
quality of its portfolio of energy contracts, evidenced by a current weighted
average risk rating for energy contract counterparties of BBB SP. As of
December31, 2009, the largest credit concentration was with AEP, which is
currently rated investment grade, representing 89% of FES total approved
credit risk.

Regulatory Matters, Environmental Matters, Other Legal Proceedings and New
Accounting Standards and Interpretations.
Results of
Operations
Earnings
available to parent decreased to $122million in 2009 from
$212million in 2008. The decrease primarily resulted from lower electric
sales revenues and higher purchased power costs, partially offset by a decrease
in other operating costs.
Revenues
Revenues
decreased by $85million, or 33%, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due
to decreases in distribution throughput and transmission revenues, partially
offset by increases in generation revenues.
Revenues
from distribution throughput decreased by $262million in 2009 compared to
2008 due to lower average unit prices and lower KWH deliveries to all customer
classes. Milder weather-influenced usage in 2009 contributed to the decreased
KWH sales to residential customers heating degree days decreased 33% and 14%
and cooling degree days decreased by 165% and 61% in OEs and Penns service
territories, respectively. Reduced deliveries to commercial and industrial
customers reflect the weakened economy. Transition charges that ceased effective
January1, 2009, with the full recovery of related costs, were partially
offset by a July 2008 increase to a PUCO-approved transmission rider and a
January 2009 distribution rate increase see Regulatory Matters 
Ohio.

Retail
generation revenues increased $92million due to higher average prices. The
higher prices were partially offset by decreases in KWH sales, reflecting the
impact of increased customer shopping in the fourth quarter of 2009. Reduced
industrial and commercial KWH sales also reflected weakened economic conditions.
Average prices increased primarily due to an increase in OE fuel cost recovery
rider that was effective from January through May 2009. Effective June1,
2009, the transmission tariff ended and the recovery of transmission costs is
included in the generation rate established under OEs CBP.

Higher
purchased power costs reflect the results of OEs power procurement process for
retail customers in 2009 see Regulatory Matters Ohio. The decrease in other
operating costs for 2009 was primarily due to lower transmission expenses
included in the cost of power purchased from others beginning June1,
2009, partially offset by costs associated with regulatory obligations for
economic development and energy efficiency programs under OEs ESP. Higher
depreciation expense in 2009 reflected capital additions since the end of 2008.
Lower amortization of net regulatory assets was primarily due to the conclusion
of transition cost amortization and distribution reliability deferrals in 2008,
partially offset by lower MISO transmission cost deferrals in 2009. The decrease
in general taxes was primarily due to lower Ohio KWH taxes in 2009 as compared
to 2008 and a $71 million adjustment recognized in 2009 related to prior
periods.
Other
Expenses
Other
expenses increased by $17million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to

Results
of Operations
CEI
experienced a loss applicable to parent of $13 million in 2009 compared to
earnings available to parent of $285million in 2008. The loss in 2009
resulted primarily from regulatory charges related to the implementation of
CEIs ESP, decreased revenues, and increased purchased power costs, partially
offset by higher deferrals of regulatory assets and lower operating
costs.
Revenues
Revenues
decreased by $140million, or 77%, in 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily
to decreases in distribution and transmission revenues, partially offset by
increases in retail generation revenues.

from distribution throughput decreased by $154million in 2009, compared to
2008 due to a decrease in KWH deliveries and lower average unit prices for all
customer classes. The lower KWH deliveries in 2009 were due primarily to weaker
economic conditions, a decrease in cooling degree days of 145% and a decrease
in heating degree days of 39%. The lower average unit price was the result of
lower transition rates in 2009 see Regulatory Matters Ohio, partially offset
by a PUCO-approved distribution rate increase effective May1,
2009.

Transmission
revenues decreased $21 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to the
elimination of transmission revenues as part of the generation rate established
under CEIs CBP, effective June1, 2009.
Retail
generation revenues increased $48million in 2009 as compared to 2008 due
to higher average unit prices across all customer classes, partially offset by
decreased sales volume to all customer classes. Average prices increased due to
an increase in CEIs fuel cost recovery rider that was effective from January
through May 2009. In addition, effective June 1, 2009, the transmission tariff
ended and the recovery of transmission costs is included in the generation rate
established under CEIs CBP. Reduced industrial KWH sales, principally to major
automotive and steel customers, reflected weakened economic
conditions.Reduced sales due to increased customer shopping was
experienced in all sectors in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Higher
purchased power costs reflect the results of CEIs power procurement process for
retail customers in 2009 see Regulatory Matters Ohio. Other operating costs
decreased due to lower transmission expenses included in the cost of purchased
power beginning June1, 2009 and reduced labor and contractor costs,
partially offset by costs associated with regulatory obligations for economic
development and energy efficiency programs under CEIs ESP, higher pension
expense and restructuring costs. Increased amortization of regulatory assets was
due primarily to the impairment of CEIs Extended RTC regulatory asset of
$216million in accordance with the PUCO-approved ESP. Decreased costs from
the increase in the deferral of new regulatory assets were due to CEIs deferral
of purchased power costs as approved by the PUCO, partially offset by lower
deferrals of MISO transmission expenses and the absence of RCP distribution
deferrals that ceased at the end of 2008. The increase in general taxes was
primarily due to higher property taxes.

OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
TE is a
wholly owned electric utility subsidiary of FirstEnergy. TE conducts business in
northwestern Ohio, providing regulated electric distribution services. TE also
provides generation services to those customers electing to retain TE as their
power supplier. Until December31, 2008, TE purchased power for delivery
and resale from a full requirements power sale agreement with its affiliate FES
at a fixed price that was reflected in rates approved by the PUCO. See
Regulatory Matters Ohio in the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of Ohio power supply procurement issues for 2009 and
beyond.
For
additional information with respect to TE, please see the information contained
in FirstEnergy Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

is incorporated by reference herein: Capital Resources and Liquidity, Guarantees
and Other Assurances, Strategy and Outlook, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,
Regulatory Matters, Environmental Matters, Other Legal Proceedings and New
Accounting Standards and Interpretations.
Results of
Operations
Earnings
available to parent in 2009 decreased to $24million from $75 million
in 2008. The decrease resulted primarily from lower electric sales revenues and
higher purchased power costs, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization
of net regulatory assets and lower other operating costs.
Revenues
Revenues
decreased $62million, or 69%, in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to
lower distribution and wholesale generation revenues, partially offset by
increased retail generation revenues.
Revenues
from distribution throughput decreased $173million in 2009 compared to
2008 due to lower average unit prices and lower KWH sales in all customer
classes that resulted primarily from adverse economic conditions. The effect of
transition charges that ceased effective January1, 2009, with the full
recovery of related costs, was partially offset by a PUCO-approved distribution
rate increase see Regulatory Matters Ohio.

offset by higher revenues from associated sales to NGC from TEs leasehold
interest in Beaver Valley Unit 2.
116
Retail
generation revenues increased $113 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to
higher average prices across all customer classes and increased KWH sales to
commercial customers, partially offset by a decrease in KWH sales to residential
and industrial customers reflecting the impact of increased customer shopping in
the fourth quarter of 2009. Average prices increased primarily due to an
increase in TE fuel cost recovery rider that was effective from January
through May 2009. In addition, effective June1, 2009, the transmission
tariff ended and the recovery of transmission costs is included in the
generation rate established under TEs CBP. Reduced industrial KWH sales,
principally to major automotive and steel customers, reflected weakened economic
conditions. Most of TEs customers returned to PLR service in December 2008,
following the termination of certain government aggregation programs in TEs
service territory, resulting in an increase in sales volume for commercial
customers.

decreased primarily due to reduced transmission expenses included in the cost
of power purchased from others beginning June1, 2009, partially offset by
costs associated with regulatory obligations for economic development and energy
efficiency programs under TEs ESP. The decrease in net amortization of
regulatory assets is primarily due to the completion of transition cost
recovery, partially offset by lower MISO transmission cost deferrals in 2009.
The decrease in general taxes was primarily due to lower Ohio KWH taxes in 2009
as compared to 2008 resulting from lower KWH sales and a $35 million adjustment
recognized in 2009 related to prior periods, partially offset by increased
property taxes.
Other
Expense
Other
expense increased $6 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to higher
interest expense associated with the April 2009 issuance of $300 million senior
secured notes, partially offset by increased nuclear decommissioning trust
investment income.

OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
JCPL
is a wholly owned, electric utility subsidiary of FirstEnergy. JCPL
conducts business in New Jersey, providing regulated electric transmission and
distribution services. JCPL also provides generation services to franchise
customers electing to retain JCPL as their power supplier. JCPL
procures electric supply to serve its BGS customers through a statewide auction
process approved by the NJBPU.
For
additional information with respect to JCPL, please see the information
contained in FirstEnergys Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations above under the following subheadings, which
information is incorporated by reference herein: Capital Resources and
Liquidity, Guarantees and Other Assurances, Strategy and Outlook, Regulatory
Matters, Environmental Matters, Other Legal Proceedings and New Accounting
Standards and Interpretations.
Results of
Operations
Net
income decreased to $170million from $187million in 2009. The
decrease was primarily due to lower revenues, partially offset by lower
purchased power costs and reduced amortization of regulatory
assets.
Revenues
Revenues
decreased by $480million, or 14% in 2009, compared with 2008. The decrease
in revenues is primarily due to a decrease in wholesale generation revenues,
retail generation revenues, and distribution revenues.
Wholesale
generation revenues decreased $232million in 2009 compared
to 2008 due to lower market prices $174 million and a decrease in sales volume
$58 million primarily resulting from the termination of a NUG contract in
October 2008.
Retail
generation revenues decreased $193million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to
lower retail generation KWH sales in all sectors, partially offset by higher
unit prices in the residential and commercial sectors. Lower sales to the
residential sector reflected milder weather in JCPLs service territory,
while the decrease in sales to the commercial sector was primarily due to an
increase in the number of shopping customers. Industrial sales were lower as a
result of weakened economic conditions.

property since 2008. Amortization of regulatory assets decreased in 2009
primarily due to the full recovery of certain regulatory assets in June 2008.
General taxes decreased principally as the result of lower Transitional Energy
Facility Assessment and sales taxes.
Other
Expenses
Other
expenses increased by $12million in 2009 compared
to 2008 primarily due to higher interest expense associated with JCPL

Sale
of Investment
On April
17, 2008, JCPL closed on the sale of its 86-MW Forked River Power Plant to
Maxim Power Corp. for $20million, as approved by an earlier order from the
NJBPU. The New Jersey Rate Counsel appealed the sale to the Appellate Division
of the Superior Court of New Jersey. On July10, 2009, the Court upheld the
NJBPUs order and the sale of the plant.
Market Risk
Information
JCPL
uses various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative contracts,
primarily to manage the risk of price and interest rate fluctuations.
FirstEnergys Risk Policy Committee, comprised of members of senior management,
provides general oversight to risk management activities.
120
Commodity
Price Risk
JCPL
is exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in electricity, energy
transmission and natural gas prices. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, JCPL uses a variety of non-derivative and derivative
instruments, including forward contracts, options, futures contracts and swaps.
The derivatives are used principally for hedging purposes. The majority of
JCPLs derivative contracts must be recorded at their fair value and marked
to market. Power purchase agreements with NUG entities that were structured
pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 are non-trading
contracts and are adjusted to fair value at the end of each quarter, with a
corresponding regulatory asset recognized for above-market costs or regulatory
liability for below-market costs. The change in the fair value of commodity
derivative contracts related to energy production during 2009 is summarized in

The
valuation of derivative contracts is based on observable market information to
the extent that such information is available. In cases where such information
is not available, JCPL relies on model-based information. The model
provides estimates of future regional prices for electricity and an estimate of
related price volatility. JCPL uses these results to develop estimates of
fair value for financial reporting purposes and for internal management decision
making. Sources of information for the valuation of commodity derivative

the near term on derivative instruments would not have had a material effect on
JCPLs consolidated financial position or cash flows as of
December31, 2009. Based on derivative contracts held as of

ANALYSIS
OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Met-Ed is a wholly
owned electric utility subsidiary of FirstEnergy. Met-Ed conducts business in
eastern Pennsylvania, providing regulated electric transmission and distribution
services. Met-Ed also provides generation service to those customers electing to
retain Met-Ed as their power supplier. On November3, 2009, FES, Met-Ed,
Penelec and Waverly restated their partial requirements power purchase agreement
for 2010. Under the new agreement, Met-Ed, Penelec, and Waverly assigned 1,300
MW of existing energy purchases to FES to assist it in supplying Met-Ed power
supply requirements and managing congestion expenses.
For additional
information with respect to Met-Ed, please see the information contained in
FirstEnergy Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations above under the following subheadings, which information
is incorporated by reference herein: Capital Resources and Liquidity, Guarantees
and Other Assurances, Strategy and Outlook, Regulatory Matters, Environmental
Matters, Other Legal Proceedings and New Accounting Standards and
Interpretations.
Results of
Operations
In 2009, Met-Ed
reported net income of $56million compared to $88 million 2008. The
decrease was primarily due to decreased distribution throughput and generation
sales, and increased interest expense, partially offset by lower other operating
costs and higher transmission rates.
Revenues
Revenues increased
by $36million, or 22%, in 2009 compared to 2008 principally due to higher
distribution and wholesale generation revenues, partially offset by a decrease
in retail generation and PJM transmission revenues.
Revenues from
distribution increased $88million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due
to higher transmission rates, resulting from the annual update of Met-Eds TSC
rider effective June1, 2009. Decreased KWH deliveries to commercial and
industrial customers reflecting the weakened economy, while decreased deliveries
to residential customers were the result of weather-related usage variations
from a 142% decrease in cooling degree days for 2009 compared to
2008.

In 2009, retail
generation revenues decreased $35million
due to lower KWH sales in all customer classes with composite unit prices
increased slightly for residential and commercial customer classes and decreased
slightly for industrial customers. Lower KWH sales to commercial and industrial
customers were principally due to economic conditions in Met-Ed service
territory. Lower KWH sales in the residential sector were due to decreased
weather-related usage as discussed above.

Purchased power
costs increased by $4 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to an increase in

KWH sales requirements. Other operating costs decreased $152 million in 2009 due
primarily to lower transmission expenses as a result of decreased congestion
costs and transmission loss expenses, partially offset by higher employee
benefit expenses. Depreciation expense increased generally due to an increase in
depreciable property since the end of 2008. The net amortization of regulatory
assets increased by $223million in 2009 resulting from increased
transmission cost recovery. In 2009, general taxes increased due to higher gross
receipts taxes resulting from increased sales revenues.
Other Expense
Other expense
increased $17 million in 2009 resulting from to an increase in interest expense
from Met-Eds $300 million Senior Notes issuance in January 2009. In addition,
less interest income was earned in 2009 on stranded regulatory assets,
reflecting lower regulatory asset balances.
Commodity
Price Risk
Met-Ed is exposed to
market risk primarily due to fluctuations in electricity, energy transmission
and natural gas prices. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures,
Met-Ed uses a variety of non-derivative and derivative instruments, including
forward contracts, options, futures contracts and swaps. The derivatives are
used principally for hedging purposes. The majority of Met-Eds derivative
contracts must be recorded at their fair value and marked to market. Certain
derivative hedging contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale
exception and are therefore excluded from the table below. Contracts that are
not exempt from such treatment include power purchase agreements with NUG
entities that were structured pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies
Act of 1978. These non-trading contracts are adjusted to fair value at the end
of each quarter, with a corresponding regulatory asset recognized for
above-market costs or regulatory liability for below-market costs. The change in
the fair value of commodity derivative contracts related to energy production
during 2009 is summarized in the following table:

The valuation of
derivative contracts is based on observable market information to the extent
that such information is available. In cases where such information is not
available, Met-Ed relies on model-based information. The model provides
estimates of future regional prices for electricity and an estimate of related
price volatility. Met-Ed uses these results to develop estimates of fair value
for financial reporting purposes and for internal management decision making.

Met-Ed performs
sensitivity analyses to estimate its exposure to the market risk of its
commodity positions. A hypothetical 10% adverse shift in quoted market prices in
the near term on derivative instruments would not have had a material effect on
Met-Eds consolidated financial position or cash flows as of December31,
2009. Based on derivative contracts held as of December31, 2009, an
adverse 10% change in commodity prices would not have a material effect on
Met-Eds net income for the next 12months.
Interest
Rate Risk
Met-Eds exposure to
fluctuations in market interest rates is reduced since a significant portion of
its debt has fixed interest rates. The table below presents principal amounts
and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for Met-Eds

PENNSYLVANIA
ELECTRIC COMPANY
MANAGEMENTS
NARRATIVE
ANALYSIS
OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Penelec is a wholly
owned electric utility subsidiary of FirstEnergy. Penelec conducts business in
northern and south central Pennsylvania, providing regulated transmission and
distribution services. Penelec also provides generation services to those
customers electing to retain Penelec as their power supplier. On November 3,
2009, Penelec, Met-Ed and Waverly restated their partial requirements power
purchase agreement for 2010. Under the new agreement, Penelec, Met-Ed, and
Waverly assigned 1,300MW of existing energy purchases to FES to assist it
in supplying Buyers power supply requirements and managing congestion
expenses.
For additional
information with respect to Penelec, please see the information contained in
FirstEnergy Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations above under the following subheadings, which information
is incorporated by reference herein: Capital Resources and Liquidity, Guarantees
and Other Assurances and Outlook: Capital Resources and Liquidity, Guarantees
and Other Assurances, Strategy and Outlook, Regulatory Matters, Environmental
Matters, Other Legal Proceedings and New Accounting Standards and
Interpretations.
Results of
Operations
Net income decreased
to $65million in 2009, compared to $88million in 2008. The decrease
was primarily due lower revenues and higher purchased power costs, partially
offset by lower other operating costs and decreased amortization of regulatory
assets.
Revenues
Revenues decreased
by $65million, or 43%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower
transmission, retail generation and distribution revenues, partially offset by
higher wholesale generation revenues.
Transmission
revenues decreased by $44million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due
to lower revenues related to Penelecs Financial Transmission Rights. Penelec
defers the difference between transmission revenues and transmission costs
incurred, resulting in no material effect to current period
earnings.
In 2009, retail
generation revenues decreased $37million primarily due to lower KWH sales
in all customer classes. Lower KWH sales to the commercial and industrial
customer classes were primarily due to weakened economic conditions in Penelecs
service territory. Lower KWH sales to the residential customer class were due to
decreased weather-related usage, reflecting a 285% decrease in cooling degree
days in 2009 compared to 2008.
Changes in retail
generation sales and revenues in 2009 as compared to 2008 are summarized in the
following tables:

Revenues from
distribution throughput decreased $7million in 2009 compared to 2008,
primarily due to decreased deliveries to the commercial and industrial sectors
reflecting the economic conditions in Penelecs service area. Offsetting this
decrease was an increase in residential unit prices due to an increase in
transmission rates, resulting from the annual update of Penelecs TSC rider
effective June1, 2009.

Purchased power
costs increased by $11million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to
higher unit costs, partially offset by reduced volume as a result of lower KWH
sales requirements. Other operating costs decreased by $19million in 2009
compared to 2008, principally due to reduced transmission and labor costs,
partially offset by higher pension and OPEB expenses. Depreciation expense
increased primarily due to an increase in depreciable property since
December31, 2008. The net amortization of regulatory assets decreased by
$15million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to increased
transmission cost deferrals as a result of increased net congestion costs.
General taxes decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower gross receipts tax as a
result of the reduced KWH sales discussed above.
Other
Expense
In 2009, other
expense decreased by $8million primarily due to lower interest expense on
borrowings from the regulated money pool and the Revolving Credit Facility,
partially offset by an increase in interest expense on long-term debt due to the
$500million debt issuance on September30, 2009.
Market
Risk Information
Penelec uses various
market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative contracts, to manage the
risk of price and interest rate fluctuations. FirstEnergys Risk Policy
Committee, comprised of members of senior management, provides general oversight
to risk management activities.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders
and Board of Directors of FirstEnergy Corp.:
In our opinion, the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements
of income, common stockholders' equity, and cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of FirstEnergy Corp. and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
Company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions.
A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

COMBINED NOTES TO THE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.ORGANIZATION
AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
FirstEnergy is a
diversified energy company that holds, directly or indirectly, all of the
outstanding common stock of its principal subsidiaries: OE, CEI, TE, Penn a
wholly owned subsidiary of OE, ATSI, JCPL, Met-Ed, Penelec, FENOC, FES and
its subsidiaries FGCO and NGC, and FESC.
FirstEnergy and its
subsidiaries follow GAAP and comply with the regulations, orders, policies and
practices prescribed by the SEC, FERC and, as applicable, the PUCO, PPUC and
NJBPU. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make periodic estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. The reported results of operations are not indicative of results of
operations for any future period. In preparing the financial statements,
FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries have evaluated events and transactions for
potential recognition or disclosure through February 18, 2010, the date the
financial statements were issued.
FirstEnergy and its
subsidiaries consolidate all majority-owned subsidiaries over which they
exercise control and, when applicable, entities for which they have a
controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances are
eliminated in consolidation unless otherwise prescribed by GAAP see Note 16.
FirstEnergy consolidates a VIE see Note 8 when it is determined to be the
VIE primary beneficiary. Investments in non-consolidated affiliates over which
FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries have the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control 20-50% owned companies, joint ventures and
partnerships are accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity
method, the interest in the entity is reported as an investment in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and the percentage share of the entitys earnings is
reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These footnotes combine
results of FE, FES, OE, CEI, TE, JCPL, Met-Ed and Penelec.
Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Unless otherwise indicated, defined terms used herein have the meanings set
forth in the accompanying Glossary of Terms.
2.SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
AACCOUNTING
FOR THE EFFECTS OF REGULATION
FirstEnergy accounts
for the effects of regulation through the application of regulatory accounting
to its operating utilities since their rates:
are
established by a third-party regulator with the authority to set rates
that bind customers;
are
cost-based; and
can be charged
to and collected from customers.
An enterprise
meeting all of these criteria capitalizes costs that would otherwise be charged
to expense regulatory assets if the rate actions of its regulator make it
probable that those costs will be recovered in future revenue. Regulatory
accounting is applied only to the parts of the business that meet the above
criteria. If a portion of the business applying regulatory accounting no longer
meets those requirements, previously recorded net regulatory assets are removed
from the balance sheet in accordance with GAAP.
187
Regulatory assets on
the Balance Sheets are comprised of the following:

Penelec had
net regulatory liabilities of approximately $137 million as of December
31, 2008. These net regulatory liabilities are included in Other
Non-Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.
Regulatory assets
that do not earn a current return primarily for certain regulatory transition
costs and employee postretirement benefits totaled approximately $187 million
as of December 31, 2009 JCPL - $36 million, Met-Ed - $114 million, and
Penelec - $37 million. Regulatory assets not earning a current return will be
recovered by 2014 for JCPL and by 2020 for Met-Ed and Penelec.
Transition
Cost Amortization
JCPLs and
Met-Eds regulatory transition costs include the deferral of above-market costs
for power supplied from NUGs of $369 million for JCPL recovered through
NGC revenues and $110 million for Met-Ed recovered through CTC revenues.
Projected above-market NUG costs are adjusted to fair value at the end of each
quarter, with a corresponding offset to regulatory assets. Recovery of the
remaining regulatory transition costs is expected to continue pursuant to
various regulatory proceedings in New Jersey and Pennsylvania see Note
11.
B
REVENUES
AND RECEIVABLES
The Utilities'
principal business is providing electric service to customers in Ohio,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Utilities' retail customers are metered on a
cycle basis. Electric revenues are recorded based on energy delivered through
the end of the calendar month. An estimate of unbilled revenues is calculated to
recognize electric service provided from the last meter reading through the end
of the month. This estimate includes many factors, among which are historical
customer usage, load profiles, estimated weather impacts, customer shopping
activity and prices in effect for each class of customer. In each accounting
period, the Utilities accrue the estimated unbilled amount receivable as revenue
and reverse the related prior period estimate.
188
Receivables from
customers include sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers and
sales to wholesale customers. There was no material concentration of receivables
as of December 31, 2009 with respect to any particular segment of FirstEnergy
customers. Billed and unbilled customer receivables as of December 31, 2009 and
2008 are shown below.

EARNINGS
PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK
Basic earnings per
share of common stock is computed using the weighted average of actual common
shares outstanding during the respective period as the denominator. The
denominator for diluted earnings per share of common stock reflects the weighted
average of common shares outstanding plus the potential additional common shares
that could result if dilutive securities and other agreements to issue common
stock were exercised. In 2007, FirstEnergy repurchased approximately 144
million shares, or 45%, of its outstanding common stock for $951 million
through an accelerated share repurchase program.The following table
reconciles basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock:

Property, plant and
equipment reflects original cost except for nuclear generating assets which
were adjusted to fair value, including payroll and related costs such as taxes,
employee benefits, administrative and general costs, and interest costs incurred
to place the assets in service. The costs of normal maintenance, repairs and
minor replacements are expensed as incurred. FirstEnergy recognizes
liabilities for planned major maintenance projects as they are incurred.

Asset
Retirement Obligations
FirstEnergy
recognizes an ARO for the future decommissioning of its nuclear power plants and
future remediation of other environmental liabilities associated with all of its
long-lived assets. The fair value of an ARO is recognized in the period in which
it is incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of
the carrying value of the long-lived asset and are depreciated over the life of
the related asset, as described further in Note 13.
E
ASSET
IMPAIRMENTS
Long-lived
Assets
FirstEnergy reviews
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. The
recoverability of the long-lived asset is measured by comparing the long-lived
assets carrying value to the sum of undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value
is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows of the long-lived asset an
impairment exists and a loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying
value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value.
Goodwill
In a business
combination, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. Based on the
guidance provided by accounting standards for the recognition and subsequent
measurement of goodwill, we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually
and make such evaluations more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. If
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including
goodwill, the goodwill is tested for impairment. If impairment is indicated a
loss is recognized calculated as the difference between the implied fair value
of a reporting unit goodwill and the carrying value of the
goodwill.
The forecasts used
in FirstEnergy evaluations of goodwill reflect operations consistent with its
general business assumptions. Unanticipated changes in those assumptions could
have a significant effect on FirstEnergy future evaluations of goodwill.
FirstEnergy goodwill primarily relates to its energy delivery services
segment.
FirstEnergys 2009
annual review was completed as of July 31, with no impairment
indicated.
FirstEnergys 2008
annual review was completed in the third quarter of 2008 with no impairment
indicated. Due to the significant downturn in the U.S. economy during the fourth
quarter of 2008, goodwill was tested for impairment as of December 31, 2008. No
impairment was indicated for the former GPU companies. As discussed in Note
11B on February 19, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed an application for an
amended ESP, which substantially reflected terms proposed by the PUCO Staff on
February 2, 2009. Goodwill for the Ohio Companies was tested as of December 31,
2008, reflecting the projected results associated with the amended ESP. No
impairment was indicated for the Ohio Companies. The PUCOs final decision did
not result in an additional impairment charge. During 2008, FirstEnergy adjusted
goodwill of the former GPU companies by $32 million due to the realization of
tax benefits that had been reserved under purchase accounting.
In 2007, FirstEnergy
adjusted goodwill for the former GPU companies by $290 million due to the
realization of tax benefits that had been reserved in purchase
accounting.

FirstEnergy, FES and
the Utilities, with the exception of Met-Ed as noted below, have no accumulated
impairment charge as of December 31, 2009.Met-Ed has an accumulated
impairment charge of $355 million, which was recorded in 2006.
Investments
At the end of each
reporting period, FirstEnergy evaluates its investments for impairment.
Investments classified as available-for-sale securities are evaluated to
determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than
temporary. FirstEnergy first considers its intent and ability to hold the
investment until recovery and then considers, among other factors, the duration
and the extent to which the security fair value has been less than its cost
and the near-term financial prospects of the security issuer when evaluating
investments for impairment. If the decline in fair value is determined to be
other than temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair
value. FirstEnergy recognizes in earnings the unrealized losses on
available-for-sale securities held in its nuclear decommissioning trusts since
the trust arrangements, as they are currently defined, do not meet the required
ability and intent to hold criteria in consideration of other-than-temporary
impairment. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, FirstEnergy recognized $62 million, $123
million and $26 million, respectively, of other-than-temporary impairments. The
fair value of FirstEnergys investments are disclosed in Note 5B.

3.PENSION
AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
FirstEnergy provides
a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan that covers
substantially all of its employees and non-qualified pension plans that cover
certain employees. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service
and compensation levels. FirstEnergy funding policy is based on actuarial
computations using the projected unit credit method. On September 2, 2009, the
Utilities and ATSI made a combined $500 million voluntary contribution to their
qualified pension plan. Due to the significance of the voluntary contribution,
FirstEnergy elected to remeasure its qualified pension plan as of August 31,
2009. FirstEnergy estimates that additional cash contributions will not be
required by law before 2012.
FirstEnergy provides
a minimum amount of noncontributory life insurance to retired employees in
addition to optional contributory insurance. Health care benefits, which include
certain employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments, are also available
upon retirement to employees hired prior to January 1, 2005, their dependents
and, under certain circumstances, their survivors. FirstEnergy recognizes the
expected cost of providing other postretirement benefits to employees and their
beneficiaries and covered dependents from the time employees are hired until
they become eligible to receive those benefits. During 2006, FirstEnergy amended
the OPEB plan effective in 2008 to cap the monthly contribution for many of the
retirees and their spouses receiving subsidized health care coverage. During
2008, FirstEnergy further amended the OPEB plan effective in 2010 to limit the
monthly contribution for pre-1990 retirees. On June 2, 2009, FirstEnergy amended
its health care benefits plan for all employees and retirees eligible to
participate in that plan. The amendment, which reduces future health care
coverage subsidies paid by FirstEnergy on behalf of participants, triggered a
remeasurement of FirstEnergys other postretirement benefit plans as of May 31,
2009. FirstEnergy also has obligations to former or inactive employees after
employment, but before retirement, for disability-related benefits.
Pension and OPEB
costs are affected by employee demographics including age, compensation levels,
and employment periods, the level of contributions made to the plans and
earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be affected by changes
in key assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, the
discount rates and health care trend rates used in determining the projected
benefit obligations for pension and OPEB costs. FirstEnergy uses a December 31
measurement date for its pension and OPEB plans. The fair value of the plan
assets represents the actual market value as of the measurement
date.
192
In the third quarter
of 2009, FirstEnergy incurred a $13 million net postretirement benefit cost
including amounts capitalized related to a liability created by the VERO
offered by FirstEnergy to qualified employees. The special termination benefits
of the VERO included additional health care coverage subsidies paid by
FirstEnergy to those qualified employees who elected to retire. A total of 715
employees accepted the VERO.

Accounting guidance
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure
fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted market
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3. The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy defined by accounting guidance are as follows:
Level 1 Quoted
prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of
the reporting date. Active markets are those where transactions for the asset or
liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing
information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 assets include registered investment
companies, common stocks, publicly traded real estate investment trusts and
certain shorter duration, more liquid fixed income securities. Registered
investment companies and common stocks are stated at fair value as quoted on a
recognized securities exchange and are valued at the last reported sales price
on the last business day of the plan year.Real estate investment
trusts and certain fixed income securities market values are based on daily
quotes available on public exchanges as with other publicly traded equity and
fixed income securities.
194
Level 2 Pricing
inputs are either directly or indirectly observable in the market as of the
reporting date, other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1.
Additionally, Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using
models or other valuation methodologies based on assumptions that are observable
in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived
from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions
are executed in the marketplace. These models are primarily industry-standard
models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for
commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual
prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic
measures. Level 2 investments include common collective trusts, certain real
estate investment trusts, and fixed income assets. Common collective trusts are
not available in an exchange and active market, however, the fair value is
determined based on the underlying investments as traded in an exchange and
active market.
Level 3 Pricing
inputs include inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources.
These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in
managements best estimate of fair value in addition to the use of independent
appraisers estimates of fair value on a periodic basis typically determined
quarterly, but no less than annually. Assets in this category include private
equity, limited partnership, certain real estate trusts and fixed income
securities.The fixed income securities market values are
based in part on quantitative models and on observing market value ascertained
through timely trades for securities that are similar in nature to the ones
being valued.

In selecting an
assumed discount rate, FirstEnergy considers currently available rates of return
on high-quality fixed income investments expected to be available during the
period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
The assumed rates of return on pension plan assets consider historical market
returns and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by
FirstEnergy pension trusts. The long-term rate of return is developed
considering the portfolios asset allocation strategy.
FirstEnergy
generally employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities
and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return on plan
assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through
careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate
financial condition. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of
equity and fixed-income investments. Equity investments are diversified across
U.S. and non-U.S. stocks, as well as growth, value, and small and large
capitalization funds. Other assets such as real estate and private equity are
used to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely
manner; however, derivatives are not used to leverage the portfolio beyond the
market value of the underlying investments. Investment risk is measured and
monitored on a continuing basis through periodic investment portfolio reviews,
annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability
studies.
FirstEnergys target
asset allocations for its pension and OPEB portfolio for 2009 and 2008 are shown

4.STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION PLANS
FirstEnergy has four
stock-based compensation programs LTIP, EDCP, ESOP and DCPD. In 2001,
FirstEnergy also assumed responsibility for two stock-based plans as a result of
its acquisition of GPU. No further stock-based compensation can be awarded under
GPUs Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan for MYR Group Inc. Employees MYR
Plan or 1990 Stock Plan for Employees of GPU, Inc. and Subsidiaries GPU Plan.
All options and restricted stock under both plans have been converted into
FirstEnergy options and restricted stock. Options under the GPU Plan became
fully vested on November 7, 2001, and will expire on or before June 1,
2010.
A
LTIP
FirstEnergys LTIP
includes four stock-based compensation programs restricted stock, restricted
stock units, stock options and performance shares.
Under FirstEnergys
LTIP, total awards cannot exceed 291 million shares of common stock or their
equivalent. Only stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units have
currently been designated to pay out in common stock, with vesting periods
ranging from two months to ten years. Performance share awards are currently
designated to be paid in cash rather than common stock and therefore do not
count against the limit on stock-based awards. As of December 31, 2009, 79
million shares were available for future awards.
FirstEnergy records
the actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions when awards are exercised or
distributed. Realized tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008, and 2007 were $9 million, $43 million, and $34 million, respectively. The
excess of the deductible amount over the recognized compensation cost is
recorded to stockholders equity and reported as an other financing activity
within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units
Eligible employees
receive awards of FirstEnergy common stock or stock units subject to
restrictions. Those restrictions lapse over a defined period of time or based on
performance. Dividends are received on the restricted stock and are reinvested
in additional shares. Restricted common stock grants under the LTIP were as

stock equal to the number of restricted stock units set forth in each agreement.
With the performance-based, FirstEnergy grants the right to receive, at the end
of the period of restriction, a number of shares of common stock equal to the
number of restricted stock units set forth in the agreement subject to
adjustment based on FirstEnergys stock performance.

FirstEnergy reduced
its use of stock options beginning in 2005 and increased its use of
performance-based, restricted stock units. As a result, all unvested stock
options vested in 2008. No compensation expense was recognized for stock options
during 2009, and compensation expense in 2008 and 2007 was not material. Cash
received from the exercise of stock options in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $7
million, $74 million and $88 million, respectively.
Performance
Shares
Performance shares
are share equivalents and do not have voting rights. The shares track the
performance of FirstEnergy common stock over a three-year vesting period.
During that time, dividend equivalents are converted into additional shares. The
final account value may be adjusted based on the ranking of FirstEnergy stock
performance to a composite of peer companies. Compensation expense recognized
for performance shares during 2009, 2008 and 2007, net of amounts capitalized,
totaled approximately $3 million, $8 million and $20 million, respectively. Cash
used to settle performance shares in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $15 million, $14
million and $10 million, respectively.
B
ESOP
An ESOP Trust funded
most of the matching contribution for FirstEnergy 401k savings plan through
December 31, 2007. All employees eligible for participation in the 401k
savings plan are covered by the ESOP. Between 1990 and 1991, the ESOP borrowed
$200 million from OE and acquired 10,654,114 shares of OE common stock
subsequently converted to FirstEnergy common stock through market purchases.
The ESOP loan was paid in full in 2008.
198
In 2008 and 2009,
shares of FirstEnergy common stock were purchased on the market and contributed
to participants accounts. Total ESOP-related compensation expenses in 2009,
2008 and 2007, net of amounts capitalized and dividends on common stock, were
$36 million, $40 million and $28 million, respectively.
C
EDCP
Under the EDCP,
covered employees can direct a portion of their compensation, including annual
incentive awards and/or long-term incentive awards, into an unfunded FirstEnergy
stock account to receive vested stock units or into an unfunded retirement cash
account. An additional 20% premium is received in the form of stock units based
on the amount allocated to the FirstEnergy stock account. Dividends are
calculated quarterly on stock units outstanding and are paid in the form of
additional stock units. Upon withdrawal, stock units are converted to
FirstEnergy shares. Payout typically occurs three years from the date of
deferral; however, an election can be made in the year prior to payout to
further defer shares into a retirement stock account that will pay out in cash
upon retirement see Note 3. Interest is calculated on the cash allocated to
the cash account and the total balance will pay out in cash upon retirement. Of
the 13 million EDCP stock units authorized, 481,028 stock units were available
for future awards as of December 31, 2009. Compensation expense income
recognized on EDCP stock units, net of amounts capitalized, was not material in
2009, $13 million in 2008 and $7 million in 2007, respectively.
D
DCPD
Under the DCPD,
directors can elect to allocate all or a portion of their cash retainers,
meeting fees and chair fees to deferred stock or deferred cash accounts. If the
funds are deferred into the stock account, a 20% match is added to the funds
allocated. The 20% match and any appreciation on it are forfeited if the
director leaves the Board within three years from the date of deferral for any
reason other than retirement, disability, death, upon a change in control, or
when a director is ineligible to stand for re-election. Compensation expense is
recognized for the 20% match over the three-year vesting period. Directors may
also elect to defer their equity retainers into the deferred stock account;
however, they do not receive a 20% match on that deferral. DCPD expenses
recognized in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $3 million. The net
liability recognized for DCPD of approximately $5 million as of December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 is included in the caption Retirement benefits on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The fair values of
long-term debt and other long-term obligations reflect the present value of the
cash outflows relating to those securities based on the current call price, the
yield to maturity or the yield to call, as deemed appropriate at the end of each
respective period. The yields assumed were based on securities with similar
characteristics offered by corporations with credit ratings similar to those of
FES and the Utilities.
B
INVESTMENTS
All temporary cash
investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less are
reported as cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, which
approximates their fair market value. Investments other than cash and cash
equivalents include held-to-maturity securities, available-for-sale securities,
and notes receivable.
199
FES and the
Utilities periodically evaluate their investments for other-than-temporary
impairment. They first consider their intent and ability to hold an equity
investment until recovery and then consider, among other factors, the duration
and the extent to which the security fair value has been less than cost and
the near-term financial prospects of the security issuer when evaluating an
investment for impairment. For debt securities, FES and the Utilities consider
their intent to hold the security, the likelihood that they will be required to
sell the security before recovery of their cost basis, and the likelihood of
recovery of the security entire amortized cost basis.
Available-For-Sale
Securities
FES and the
Utilities hold debt and equity securities within their nuclear decommissioning
trusts, nuclear fuel disposal trusts and NUG trusts. These trust investments are
considered as available-for-sale at fair market value. FES and the Utilities
have no securities held for trading purposes.
The following table
summarizes the cost basis, unrealized gains and losses and fair values of
investments in available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2009 and

Unrealized
gains applicable to the decommissioning trusts of FES, OE and TE are recognized
in OCI as fluctuations in fair value will eventually impact earnings. The
decommissioning trusts of JCPL, Met-Ed and Penelec are subject to
regulatory accounting. Net unrealized gains and losses are recorded as
regulatory assets or liabilities since the difference between investments held
in trust and the decommissioning liabilities will be recovered from or refunded
to customers.
The
investment policy for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds restricts or
limits the ability to hold certain types of assets including private or direct
placements, warrants, securities of FirstEnergy, investments in companies owning
nuclear power plants, financial derivatives, preferred stocks, securities
convertible into common stock and securities of the trust fund custodian or
managers and their parents or subsidiaries.
During
2009, 2008 and 2007, FirstEnergy recognized $176 million, $63 million and $10
million of net realized gains resulting from the sale of securities held in
nuclear decommissioning trusts.

C
RECURRING
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair
value is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a
liability exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants
on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy has been established that
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs Level 3. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are
as follows:
Level 1
Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those where
transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume
to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. FirstEnergys Level 1 assets
and liabilities primarily consist of exchange-traded derivatives and equity
securities listed on active exchanges that are held in various
trusts.
201
Level 2
Pricing inputs are either directly or indirectly observable in the market as
of the reporting date, other than quoted prices in active markets included in
Level 1. FirstEnergys Level 2 assets and liabilities consist primarily of
investments in debt securities held in various trusts and commodity forwards.
Additionally, Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using
models or other valuation methodologies based on assumptions that are observable
in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived
from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions
are executed in the marketplace. These models are primarily industry-standard
models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for
commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual
prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic
measures. Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives
such as forwards and certain interest rate swaps.
Level 3
Pricing inputs include inputs that are generally less observable from
objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed
methodologies that result in managements best estimate of fair value.
FirstEnergy develops its view of the future market price of key commodities
through a combination of market observation and assessment generally for the
short term and fundamental modeling generally for the long term. Key
fundamental electricity model inputs are generally directly observable in the
market or derived from publicly available historic and forecast data. Some key
inputs reflect forecasts published by industry leading consultants who generally
employ similar fundamental modeling approaches. Fundamental model inputs and
results, as well as the selection of consultants, reflect the consensus of
appropriate FirstEnergy management. Level 3 instruments include those that may
be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers needs. FirstEnergys
Level 3 instruments consist exclusively of NUG contracts.
FirstEnergy
utilizes market data and assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks
inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily
observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. FirstEnergy
primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements
using the best information available. Accordingly, FirstEnergy maximizes the use
of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs.
The
following tables set forth financial assets and financial liabilities that are
accounted for at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008. Assets and liabilities are classified in their
entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. FirstEnergy assessment of the significance of a particular
input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the fair
valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value
hierarchy levels. During 2009, there were no significant transfers in or out of
Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
FirstEnergy
is exposed to financial risks resulting from fluctuating interest rates and
commodity prices, including prices for electricity, natural gas, coal and energy
transmission. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, FirstEnergy
uses a variety of derivative instruments, including forward contracts, options,
futures contracts and swaps. The derivatives are used for risk management
purposes. In addition to derivatives, FirstEnergy also enters into master
netting agreements with certain third parties. FirstEnergy Risk Policy
Committee, comprised of members of senior management, provides general
management oversight for risk management activities throughout FirstEnergy. The
Committee is responsible for promoting the effective design and implementation
of sound risk management programs and oversees compliance with corporate risk
management policies and established risk management practices.
FirstEnergy
accounts for derivative instruments on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair
value unless they meet the normal purchase and normal sales criteria.
Derivatives that meet those criteria are accounted for at cost under the accrual
method of accounting. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments
that do not meet the normal purchase and normal sales criteria are included in
purchased power, other expense, unrealized gain loss on derivative hedges in
other comprehensive income loss, or as part of the value of the hedged item. A
hypothetical 10% adverse shift an increase or decrease depending on the
derivative position in quoted market prices in the near term on its derivative
instruments would not have had a material effect on FirstEnergys consolidated
financial position assets, liabilities and equity or cash flows as of December
31, 2009. Based on derivative contracts held as of December 31, 2009, an adverse
10% change in commodity prices would decrease net income by approximately $9
million during the next 12 months.
Interest
Rate Risk
FirstEnergy
uses a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to manage interest rate
exposure. Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are used, which are typically
designated as fair value hedges, as a means to manage interest rate exposure. In
addition, FirstEnergy uses interest rate derivatives to lock in interest rate
levels in anticipation of future financings, which are typically designated as
cash-flow hedges.
Cash
Flow Hedges
Under
the revolving credit facility see Note 14, FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries,
incur variable interest charges based on LIBOR. FirstEnergy currently holds a
swap with a notional value of $100 million to hedge against changes in
associated interest rates. This hedge will expire in January 2010 and is
accounted for as a cash flow hedge. As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of
the outstanding swap was immaterial.
FirstEnergy
uses forward starting swap agreements to hedge a portion of the consolidated
interest rate risk associated with issuances of fixed-rate, long-term debt
securities of its subsidiaries. These derivatives are treated as cash flow
hedges, protecting against the risk of changes in future interest payments
resulting from changes in benchmark U.S. Treasury rates between the date of
hedge inception and the date of the debt issuance. During 2009, FirstEnergy
terminated forward swaps with a notional value of $28 billion and recognized
losses of approximately $185 million; the ineffective portion recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense was immaterial. The remaining effective portions
will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the hedged
debt.
Interest
rate derivatives are included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities on FirstEnergys
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effects of interest rate derivatives on the
Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income during 2009 and 2008

unamortized losses included in AOCL associated with prior interest rate hedges
totaled $104 million $62million net of tax as
of December 31, 2009. Based on current estimates, approximately $11 million will
be amortized to interest expense during the next twelve months. FirstEnergys
interest rate swaps do not include any contingent credit risk related
features.
Fair
Value Hedges
FirstEnergy
uses fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the
consolidated interest rate risk associated with the debt portfolio of its
subsidiaries. These derivatives are treated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate,
long-term debt issues, protecting against the risk of changes in the fair value
of fixed-rate debt instruments due to lower interest rates. Swap maturities,
call options, fixed interest rates and interest payment dates match those of the
underlying obligations. As of December 31, 2009, the debt underlying the $250
million outstanding notional amount of interest rate swaps had a weighted
average fixed interest rate of 645%, which the swaps have converted to a
current weighted average variable rate of 54%. The gain or loss on the
derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings and were immaterial
in 2009.
Commodity
Derivatives
FirstEnergy
uses both physically and financially settled derivatives to manage its exposure
to volatility in commodity prices. Commodity derivatives are used for risk
management purposes to hedge exposures when it makes economic sense to do so,
including circumstances where the hedging relationship does not qualify for
hedge accounting. Derivatives that do not qualify under the normal purchase or
sales criteria or for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges are marked to market
through earnings. FirstEnergys risk policy does not allow derivatives to be
used for speculative or trading purposes. FirstEnergy hedges forecasted electric
sales and purchases and anticipated natural gas purchases using forwards and
options. Heating oil futures are used to hedge oil purchases and fuel surcharges
associated with rail transportation contracts. FirstEnergys hedge term is
typically two years. The effective portions of all cash flow hedges are
initially recorded in AOCL and are subsequently included in net income as the
underlying hedged commodities are delivered.
FirstEnergy
discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that a
derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a
hedged item, in the case of forward-starting hedges, or when it is no longer
probable that the forecasted transaction will occur. In 2009, FirstEnergy did
not discontinue hedge accounting for any cash flow hedge items.
During
2008, in anticipation of certain regulatory actions, FES entered into purchased
power contracts representing approximately 44 million MWH per year for MISO
delivery in 2010 and 2011. These contracts, which represented less than 10% of
FES estimated Ohio load, were intended to cover potential short positions that
were anticipated in those years and qualified for the normal purchase normal
sale scope exception under accounting for Derivatives and Hedging. In the fourth
quarter of 2009, as FES determined that the short positions in 2010 and 2011
were not expected to materialize based on reductions in PLR obligations and
decreased demand due to economic conditions, the contracts were modified to
financially settle to avoid congestion and transmission expenses associated with
physical delivery. As a result of the modification, the fair value of the
contracts was recorded, resulting in a mark-to-market charge of approximately
$205 million $129 million, after tax to purchased power expense. For all other
purchased power contracts qualifying for the normal purchase normal sale scope
exception, the Company expects to take physical delivery of the power over the
remaining term of the contracts.

forwards are used to balance expected retail and wholesale sales with expected
generation and purchased power. Natural gas futures are entered into based on
expected consumption of natural gas, primarily used in FirstEnergys peaking
units. Heating oil futures are entered into based on expected consumption of oil
and the financial risk in FirstEnergys coal transportation contracts.
Derivative instruments are not used in quantities greater than forecasted needs.

Total
unamortized losses included in AOCL associated with commodity derivatives were
$15 million $9 million net of tax as of December 31, 2009, as compared to $44
million $27 million net of tax as of December 31, 2008. The net of tax change
resulted from a $16 million decrease due to net hedge losses reclassified to
earnings during 2009. Based on current estimates, approximately $9 million
after tax of the net deferred losses on derivative instruments in AOCL as of
December 31, 2009 are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next
twelve months as hedged transactions occur. The fair value of these derivative
instruments fluctuate from period to period based on various market
factors.
Many of
FirstEnergys commodity derivatives contain credit risk features. As of December
31, 2009, FirstEnergy posted $153 million of collateral related to net liability
positions and held $26 million of counterparties funds related to asset
positions. The collateral FirstEnergy has posted relates to both derivative and
non-derivative contracts. FirstEnergys largest derivative counterparties fully
collateralize all derivative transactions. Certain commodity derivative
contracts include credit risk-related contingent features that would require
FirstEnergy to post additional collateral if the credit rating for its debt were
to fall below investment grade. The aggregate fair value of derivative
instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that are in a liability
position on December 31, 2009 was $220 million, for which $127 million in
collateral has been posted. If FirstEnergys credit rating were to fall below
investment grade, it would be required to post $47 million of additional
collateral related to commodity derivatives.

LEASES
FirstEnergy
leases certain generating facilities, office space and other property and
equipment under cancelable and noncancelable leases.
In 1987,
OE sold portions of its ownership interests in Perry Unit 1 and Beaver Valley
Unit 2 and entered into operating leases on the portions sold for basic lease
terms of approximately 29 years. In that same year, CEI and TE also sold
portions of their ownership interests in Beaver Valley Unit 2 and Bruce
Mansfield Units 1, 2 and 3 and entered into similar operating leases for lease
terms of approximately 30 years. During the terms of their respective leases,
OE, CEI and TE are responsible, to the extent of their leasehold interests, for
costs associated with the units including construction expenditures, operation
and maintenance expenses, insurance, nuclear fuel, property taxes and
decommissioning. They have the right, at the expiration of the respective basic
lease terms, to renew their respective leases. They also have the right to
purchase the facilities at the expiration of the basic lease term or any renewal
term at a price equal to the fair market value of the facilities. The basic
rental payments are adjusted when applicable federal tax law
changes.
207
On July
13, 2007, FGCO completed a sale and leaseback transaction for its 93825%
undivided interest in Bruce Mansfield Unit 1, representing 779 MW of net
demonstrated capacity. The purchase price of approximately $1329 billion net
after-tax proceeds of approximately $12 billion for the undivided interest was
funded through a combination of equity investments by affiliates of AIG
Financial Products Corp. and Union Bank of California, N.A. in six lessor trusts
and proceeds from the sale of $1135 billion aggregate principal amount of 685%
pass through certificates due 2034. A like principal amount of secured notes
maturing June 1, 2034 were issued by the lessor trusts to the pass through trust
that issued and sold the certificates. The lessor trusts leased the undivided
interest back to FGCO for a term of approximately 33 years under substantially
identical leases. FES has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed all of
FGCOs obligations under each of the leases. This transaction, which is
classified as an operating lease for FES and FirstEnergy, generated tax capital
gains of approximately $815 million, all of which were offset by existing tax
capital loss carryforwards. Accordingly, FirstEnergy reduced its tax loss
carryforward valuation allowances in 2007, with a corresponding reduction to
goodwill see Note 2E.
Effective
October 16, 2007 CEI and TE assigned their leasehold interests in the Bruce
Mansfield Plant to FGCO and FGCO assumed all of CEIs and TEs obligations
arising under those leases. FGCO subsequently transferred the Unit 1 portion of
these leasehold interests, as well as FGCOs leasehold interests under its July
13, 2007 Bruce Mansfield Unit 1 sale and leaseback transaction, to a newly
formed wholly-owned subsidiary on December 17, 2007. The subsidiary assumed all
of the lessee obligations associated with the assigned interests. However, CEI
and TE remain primarily liable on the 1987 leases and related agreements. FGCO
remains primarily liable on the 2007 leases and related agreements, and FES
remains primarily liable as a guarantor under the related 2007 guarantees, as to
the lessors and other parties to the respective agreements. These assignments
terminate automatically upon the termination of the underlying
leases.
During
2008, NGC purchased 568 MW of lessor equity interests in the OE 1987 sale and
leaseback of the Perry Plant and approximately 435 MW of lessor equity
interests in the OE 1987 sale and leaseback of Beaver Valley Unit 2. In
addition, NGC purchased 1585 MW of lessor equity interests in the TE and CEI
1987 sale and leaseback of Beaver Valley Unit 2. The Ohio Companies continue to
lease these MW under their respective sale and leaseback arrangements and the
related lease debt remains outstanding.

by OE in 1996, PNBV purchased a portion of the lease obligation bonds issued on
behalf of lessors in OE Perry Unit 1 and Beaver Valley Unit 2 sale and
leaseback transactions. Similarly, CEI and TE established Shippingport in 1997
to purchase the lease obligation bonds issued on behalf of lessors in their
Bruce Mansfield Units 1, 2 and 3 sale and leaseback transactions. The PNBV and

INTEREST ENTITIES
FirstEnergy
and its subsidiaries consolidate VIEs when they are determined to be the VIE
primary beneficiary. FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries reflect the portion of
VIEs not owned by them in the caption noncontrolling interest within the
consolidated financial statements. The change in noncontrolling interest during
2009 is the result of net losses of the noncontrolling interests $16 million,
the acquisition of additional interest in certain joint ventures and other
adjustments $13 million, and distributions to owners $5
million.

Mining
Operations
On July
16, 2008, FEV entered into a joint venture with the Boich Companies, a Columbus,
Ohio-based coal company, to acquire a majority stake in the Signal Peak mining
and coal transportation operations near Roundup, Montana. FEV made a $125
million equity investment in the joint venture, which acquired 80% of the mining
operations Signal Peak Energy, LLC and 100% of the transportation operations,
with FEV owning a 45% economic interest and an affiliate of the Boich Companies
owning a 55% economic interest in the joint venture. Both parties have a 50%
voting interest in the joint venture. FEV consolidates the mining and
transportation operations of this joint venture in its financial statements. In
March 2009, FEV agreed to pay a total of $85 million to affiliates of the Boich
Companies to purchase an additional 5% economic interest in the Signal Peak
mining and coal transportation operations. Voting interests remained unchanged
after the sale was completed in July 2009. Effective August 21, 2009, the joint
venture acquired the remaining 20% stake in the mining operations by issuing a
five-year note for $475 million. For both acquisitions, the difference between
the consideration paid and the adjustment to the noncontrolling interest
resulted in a charge to other paid in capital of approximately $30
million.
Trusts
FirstEnergy
consolidated financial statements include PNBV and Shippingport, VIEs created in
1996 and 1997, respectively, to refinance debt originally issued in connection
with sale and leaseback transactions. PNBV and Shippingport financial data are
included in the consolidated financial statements of OE and CEI,
respectively.
PNBV was
established to purchase a portion of the lease obligation bonds issued in
connection with OE 1987 sale and leaseback of its interests in the Perry Plant
and Beaver Valley Unit 2. OE used debt and available funds to purchase the notes
issued by PNBV for the purchase of lease obligation bonds. Ownership of PNBV
includes a 3% equity interest by an unaffiliated third party and a 3% equity
interest held by OES Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of OE. Shippingport was
established to purchase all of the lease obligation bonds issued in connection
with CEI and TE Bruce Mansfield Plant sale and leaseback transaction in
1987. CEI and TE used debt and available funds to purchase the notes issued by
Shippingport.
Loss
Contingencies
FES and
the Ohio Companies are exposed to losses under their applicable sale-leaseback
agreements upon the occurrence of certain contingent events that each company
considers unlikely to occur. The maximum exposure under these provisions
represents the net amount of casualty value payments due upon the occurrence of
specified casualty events that render the applicable plant worthless. Net
discounted lease payments would not be payable if the casualty loss payments are
made. The following table shows each companys net exposure to loss based upon
the casualty value provisions mentioned above:

operating lease commitments was $17billion as of
December 31, 2009

7 for a discussion of CEIs and TEs assignment of their leasehold interests in
the Bruce Mansfield Plant to FGCO.
Power
Purchase Agreements
FirstEnergy
evaluated its power purchase agreements and determined that certain NUG entities
may be VIEs to the extent they own a plant that sells substantially all of its
output to the Utilities and the contract price for power is correlated with the
plant variable costs of production. FirstEnergy, through its subsidiaries
JCPL, Met-Ed and Penelec, maintains 26 long-term power purchase agreements
with NUG entities. The agreements were entered into pursuant to the Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. FirstEnergy was not involved in the
creation of, and has no equity or debt invested in, these
entities.
210
FirstEnergy
has determined that for all but eight of these entities, neither JCPL,
Met-Ed nor Penelec have variable interests in the entities or the entities are
governmental or not-for-profit organizations not within the scope of
consolidation consideration for VIEs. JCPL, Met-Ed or Penelec may hold
variable interests in the remaining eight entities, which sell their output at
variable prices that correlate to some extent with the operating costs of the
plants. FirstEnergy periodically requests from these eight entities the
information necessary to determine whether they are VIEs or whether JCPL,
Met-Ed or Penelec is the primary beneficiary. FirstEnergy has been unable to
obtain the requested information, which in most cases was deemed by the
requested entity to be proprietary. As such, FirstEnergy applied the scope
exception that exempts enterprises unable to obtain the necessary information to
evaluate entities.
Since
FirstEnergy has no equity or debt interests in the NUG entities, its maximum
exposure to loss relates primarily to the above-market costs it incurs for
power. FirstEnergy expects any above-market costs it incurs to be recovered from
customers. Purchased power costs from these entities during 2009, 2008, and 2007
were $165 million, $178 million, and $176 million, respectively.

DIVESTITURES
On March
7, 2008, FirstEnergy sold certain telecommunication assets, resulting in a net
after-tax gain of $193 million. The sale of assets did not meet the criteria
for classification as discontinued operations as of December 31,
2008.

TAXES
Income
Taxes
FirstEnergy
records income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts recognized for tax purposes. Investment tax credits,
which were deferred when utilized, are being amortized over the recovery period
of the related property. Deferred income tax liabilities related to temporary
tax and accounting basis differences and tax credit carryforward items are
recognized at the statutory income tax rates in effect when the liabilities are
expected to be paid. Deferred tax assets are recognized based on income tax
rates expected to be in effect when they are settled. Details of income taxes
for the three years ended December 31, 2009 are shown below:

FES and
the Utilities are party to an intercompany income tax allocation agreement with
FirstEnergy and its other subsidiaries that provides for the allocation of
consolidated tax liabilities. Net tax benefits attributable to FirstEnergy,
excluding any tax benefits derived from interest expense associated with
acquisition indebtedness from the merger with GPU, are reallocated to the
subsidiaries of FirstEnergy that have taxable income. That allocation is
accounted for as a capital contribution to the company receiving the tax
benefit.

Upon
reaching a settlement on several items under appeal for the tax years 2001-2003,
as well as other items that effectively settled in 2009, FirstEnergy recognized
approximately $100 million of net tax benefits, including $161 million that
favorably affected FirstEnergys effective tax rate. The offsetting $61 million
primarily related to tax items where the uncertainty was removed and the tax
refund will be received when the tax years are closed. Upon completion of the
federal tax examinations for tax years 2004-2006, as well as other tax
settlements reached in 2008, FirstEnergy recognized approximately $42 million of
net tax benefits, including $7 million that favorably affected FirstEnergys
effective tax rate. The remaining balance of the tax benefits recognized in 2008
adjusted goodwill as a purchase price adjustment $20 million and accumulated
deferred income taxes for temporary tax items $15 million. During 2007, there
were no material changes to FirstEnergys unrecognized tax
benefits.
As of
December 31, 2009, it is reasonably possible that approximately $148 million of
the unrecognized benefits may be resolved within the next twelve months, of
which up to approximately $11 million, if recognized, would affect FirstEnergys
effective tax rate. The potential decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax
benefits is primarily associated with issues related to the capitalization of
certain costs and various state tax items.
In 2008,
FirstEnergy, on behalf of FGCO and NGC, filed a change in accounting method
related to the costs to repair and maintain electric generation stations. During
the second quarter of 2009, the IRS approved the change in accounting method and
$281 million of costs were included as a repair deduction on FirstEnergys 2008
consolidated tax return. Since the IRS did not complete its review over this
change in accounting method by the extended filing date of FirstEnergys federal
tax return, FirstEnergy increased the amount of unrecognized tax benefits by $34
million in the third quarter of 2009, with a corresponding adjustment to
accumulated deferred income taxes for this temporary tax item. There was no
impact on FirstEnergys effective tax rate for the year.
In 2009,
FirstEnergy, on behalf of OE, PP, CEI, TE, ATSI, JCPL, Met-Ed and Penelec,
filed a change in accounting method related to the costs to repair and maintain
electric utility network transmission and distribution assets and is in the
process of computing the amount of costs that will qualify as a deduction to be
included on FirstEnergys 2009 consolidated tax return. This change in
accounting method is expected to have a material impact on taxable income for
2009 and could increase the amount of tax refunds to be recognized in 2010 with
a corresponding adjustment to accumulated deferred income taxes for this
temporary tax item. There would be no impact on FirstEnergys effective tax
rate.

FirstEnergy
recognizes interest expense or income related to uncertain tax positions. That
amount is computed by applying the applicable statutory interest rate to the
difference between the tax position recognized and the amount previously taken
or expected to be taken on the tax return. FirstEnergy includes net interest and
penalties in the provision for income taxes. The reversal of accrued interest
associated with the $161 million in recognized tax benefits favorably affected
FirstEnergy effective tax rate in 2009 by $56 million and an interest
receivable of $11 million was removed from the accrued interest for uncertain
tax positions. The reversal of accrued interest associated with the $56 million
in recognized tax benefits favorably affected FirstEnergys effective tax rate
in 2008 by $12 million and an interest receivable of $4 million was removed from
the accrued interest for uncertain tax positions. During the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, FirstEnergy recognized net interest expense
income of approximately $49 million, $2 million and $19 million,
respectively. The net amount of interest accrued as of December 31, 2009 and
2008 was $21 million and $59 million, respectively.
The
following table summarizes the net interest expense income recognized by FES
and the Utilities for the three years ended December 31, 2009 and the cumulative

has tax returns that are under review at the audit or appeals level by the IRS
and state tax authorities. All state jurisdictions are open from 2001-2008. The
IRS began reviewing returns for the years 2001-2003 in July 2004 and several
items were under appeal. In the fourth quarter of 2009, these items were settled
at appeals and sent to Joint Committee on Taxation for final review. The federal
audits for years 2004-2006 were completed in the third quarter of 2008 and
several items are under appeal. The IRS began auditing the year 2007 in February
2007 under its Compliance Assurance Process program and was completed in the
first quarter of 2009 with two items under appeal. The IRS began auditing the
year 2008 in February 2008 and the audit is expected to close before December
2010. The 2009 tax year audit began in February 2009 and is not expected to
close before December 2010. Management believes that adequate reserves have been
recognized and final settlement of these audits is not expected to have a
material adverse effect on FirstEnergys financial condition or results of
operations.
On July
13, 2007, FGCO completed a sale and leaseback transaction for its 93825%
undivided interest in Bruce Mansfield Unit 1, representing 779 MW of net
demonstrated capacity see Note 7. This transaction generated tax capital gains
of approximately $815 million, all of which were offset by existing tax capital
loss carryforwards. Accordingly, FirstEnergy reduced its tax loss carryforward
valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2007, with a corresponding reduction
to goodwill see Note 2E.
FirstEnergy
has pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards for state and local income tax
purposes of approximately $1044 billion, of which $194 million is expected to
be utilized. The associated deferred tax assets are $11 million. These losses

REGULATORY
MATTERS
A
RELIABILITY
INITIATIVES
In 2005,
Congress amended the FPA to provide for federally-enforceable mandatory
reliability standards. The mandatory reliability standards apply to the bulk
power system and impose certain operating, record-keeping and reporting
requirements on the Utilities and ATSI. The NERC is charged with establishing
and enforcing these reliability standards, although it has delegated day-to-day
implementation and enforcement of its responsibilities to eight regional
entities, including ReliabilityFirst Corporation. All of FirstEnergys
facilities are located within the ReliabilityFirst region. FirstEnergy actively
participates in the NERC and ReliabilityFirst stakeholder processes, and
otherwise monitors and manages its companies in response to the ongoing
development, implementation and enforcement of the reliability
standards.
FirstEnergy
believes that it is in compliance with all currently-effective and enforceable
reliability standards. Nevertheless, it is clear that the NERC, ReliabilityFirst
and the FERC will continue to refine existing reliability standards as well as
to develop and adopt new reliability standards. The financial impact of
complying with new or amended standards cannot be determined at this time.
However, the 2005 amendments to the FPA provide that all prudent costs incurred
to comply with the new reliability standards be recovered in rates. Still, any
future inability on FirstEnergys part to comply with the reliability standards
for its bulk power system could result in the imposition of financial penalties
that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.
In April
2007, ReliabilityFirst performed a routine compliance audit of FirstEnergys
bulk-power system within the Midwest ISO region and found it to be in full
compliance with all audited reliability standards. Similarly, in October 2008,
ReliabilityFirst performed a routine compliance audit of FirstEnergys
bulk-power system within the PJM region and found it to be in full compliance
with all audited reliability standards.Our MISO facilities are next
due for the periodic audit by ReliabilityFirst later this
year.
217
On
December 9, 2008, a transformer at JCPLs Oceanview substation failed,
resulting in an outage on certain bulk electric system transmission voltage
lines out of the Oceanview and Atlantic substations, with customers in the
affected area losing power. Power was restored to most customers within a few
hours and to all customers within eleven hours. On December 16, 2008, JCPL
provided preliminary information about the event to certain regulatory agencies,
including the NERC. On March 31, 2009, the NERC initiated a Compliance Violation
Investigation in order to determine JCPLs contribution to the electrical
event and to review any potential violation of NERC Reliability Standards
associated with the event. The initial phase of the investigation required
JCPL to respond to the NERCs request for factual data about the outage.
JCPL submitted its written response on May 1, 2009. The NERC conducted on
site interviews with personnel involved in responding to the event on June
16-17, 2009. On July 7, 2009, the NERC issued additional questions regarding the
event and JCPL replied as requested on August 6, 2009. JCPL is not
able at this time to predict what actions, if any, that the NERC may take based
on the data submittals or interview results.
On June
5, 2009, FirstEnergy self-reported to ReliabilityFirst a potential violation
of NERC Standard PRC-005 resulting from its inability to validate maintenance
records for 20 protection system relays out of approcimately 20,000 reportable
relays in JCPLs and Penelecs transmission systems. These potential
violations were discovered during a comprehensive field review of all
FirstEnergy substations to verify equipment and maintenance database accuracy.
FirstEnergy has completed all mitigation actions, including calibrations and
maintenance records for the relays. ReliabilityFirst issued an Initial
Notice of Alleged Violation on June 22, 2009. The NERC approved FirstEnergys
mitigation plan on August 19, 2009, and submitted it to the FERC for approval on
August 19, 2009. FirstEnergy is not able at this time to predict what actions or
penalties, if any, that ReliabilityFirst will propose for this
self-reported violation.
B
OHIO
On June
7, 2007, the Ohio Companies filed an application for an increase in electric
distribution rates with the PUCO and, on August 6, 2007, updated their filing.
On January 21, 2009, the PUCO granted the Ohio Companies application in part to
increase electric distribution rates by $1366 million OE - $689 million, CEI
- - $292 million and TE - $385 million. These increases went into effect for OE
and TE on January 23, 2009, and for CEI on May 1, 2009. Applications for
rehearing of this order were filed by the Ohio Companies and one other party on
February 20, 2009. The PUCO granted these applications for rehearing on March
18, 2009 for the purpose of further consideration. The PUCO has not yet issued a
substantive Entry on Rehearing.
SB221,
which became effective on July 31, 2008, required all electric utilities to file
an ESP, and permitted the filing of an MRO. On July 31, 2008, the Ohio Companies
filed with the PUCO a comprehensive ESP and a separate MRO. The PUCO denied the
MRO application; however, the PUCO later granted the Ohio Companies application
for rehearing for the purpose of further consideration of the matter. The PUCO
has not yet issued a substantive Entry on Rehearing.The ESP proposed
to phase in new generation rates for customers beginning in 2009 for up to a
three-year period and resolve the Ohio Companies collection of fuel costs
deferred in 2006 and 2007, and the distribution rate request described above. In
response to the PUCOs December 19, 2008 order, which significantly modified and
approved the ESP as modified, the Ohio Companies notified the PUCO that they
were withdrawing and terminating the ESP application in addition to continuing
their rate plan then in effect as allowed by the terms of SB221. On December 31,
2008, the Ohio Companies conducted a CBP for the procurement of electric
generation for retail customers from January 5, 2009 through March 31, 2009. The
average winning bid price was equivalent to a retail rate of 698 cents per KWH.
The power supply obtained through this process provided generation service to
the Ohio Companies retail customers who chose not to shop with alternative
suppliers. On January 9, 2009, the Ohio Companies requested the implementation
of a new fuel rider to recover the costs resulting from the December 31, 2008
CBP. The PUCO ultimately approved the Ohio Companies request for a new fuel
rider to recover increased costs resulting from the CBP but denied OEs and TEs
request to continue collecting RTC and denied the request to allow the Ohio
Companies to continue collections pursuant to the two existing fuel riders. The
new fuel rider recovered the increased purchased power costs for OE and TE, and
recovered a portion of those costs for CEI, with the remainder being deferred
for future recovery.
218
On
January 29, 2009, the PUCO ordered its Staff to develop a proposal to establish
an ESP for the Ohio Companies. On February 19, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed an
Amended ESP application, including an attached Stipulation and Recommendation
that was signed by the Ohio Companies, the Staff of the PUCO, and many of the
intervening parties. Specifically, the Amended ESP provided that generation
would be provided by FES at the average wholesale rate of the CBP process
described above for April and May 2009 to the Ohio Companies for their
non-shopping customers; for the period of June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2011,
retail generation prices would be based upon the outcome of a descending clock
CBP on a slice-of-system basis. The Amended ESP further provided that the Ohio
Companies will not seek a base distribution rate increase, subject to certain
exceptions, with an effective date of such increase before January 1, 2012, that
CEI would agree to write-off approximately $216 million of its Extended RTC
regulatory asset, and that the Ohio Companies would collect a delivery service
improvement rider at an overall average rate of $002 per KWH for the period of
April 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011. The Amended ESP also addressed a number
of other issues, including but not limited to, rate design for various customer
classes, and resolution of the prudence review and the collection of deferred
costs that were approved in prior proceedings. On February 26, 2009, the Ohio
Companies filed a Supplemental Stipulation, which was signed or not opposed by
virtually all of the parties to the proceeding, that supplemented and modified
certain provisions of the February 19, 2009 Stipulation and Recommendation.
Specifically, the Supplemental Stipulation modified the provision relating to
governmental aggregation and the Generation Service Uncollectible Rider,
provided further detail on the allocation of the economic development funding
contained in the Stipulation and Recommendation, and proposed additional
provisions related to the collaborative process for the development of energy
efficiency programs, among other provisions. The PUCO adopted and approved
certain aspects of the Stipulation and Recommendation on March 4, 2009, and
adopted and approved the remainder of the Stipulation and Recommendation and
Supplemental Stipulation without modification on March 25, 2009. Certain aspects
of the Stipulation and Recommendation and Supplemental Stipulation took effect
on April 1, 2009 while the remaining provisions took effect on June 1,
2009.
The CBP
auction occurred on May 13-14, 2009, and resulted in a weighted average
wholesale price for generation and transmission of 615 cents per KWH. The bid
was for a single, two-year product for the service period from June 1, 2009
through May 31, 2011. FES participated in the auction, winning 51% of the
tranches one tranche equals one percent of the load supply. Subsequent to the
signing of the wholesale contracts, four winning bidders reached separate
agreements with FES with the result that FES is now responsible for providing
77% of the Ohio Companies total load supply.The results of the CBP
were accepted by the PUCO on May 14, 2009. FES has also separately contracted
with numerous communities to provide retail generation service through
governmental aggregation programs.
On July
27, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed applications with the PUCO to recover three
different categories of deferred distribution costs on an accelerated basis. In
the Ohio Companies' Amended ESP, the PUCO approved the recovery of these
deferrals, with collection originally set to begin in January 2011 and to
continue over a 5 or 25 year period. The principal amount plus carrying charges
through August 31, 2009 for these deferrals totaled $3051 million. The
applications were approved by the PUCO on August 19, 2009. Recovery of this
amount, together with carrying charges calculated as approved in the Amended
ESP, commenced on September 1, 2009, and will be collected in the 18 non-summer
months from September 2009 through May 2011, subject to reconciliation until
fully collected, with $165 million of the above amount being recovered from
residential customers, and $1401 million being recovered from non-residential
customers.
SB221
also requires electric distribution utilities to implement energy efficiency
programs. Under the provisions of SB221, the Ohio Companies are required to
achieve a total annual energy savings equivalent of approximately 166,000 MWH in
2009, 290,000 MWH in 2010, 410,000 MWH in 2011, 470,000 MWH in 2012 and 530,000
MWH in 2013, with additional savings required through 2025. Utilities are also
required to reduce peak demand in 2009 by 1%, with an additional 75% reduction
each year thereafter through 2018. The PUCO may amend these benchmarks in
certain, limited circumstances, and the Ohio Companies have filed an application
with the PUCO seeking such amendments. As discussed below, on January 7, 2010,
the PUCO amended the 2009 energy efficiency benchmarks to zero, contingent upon
the Ohio Companies meeting the revised benchmarks in a period of not more than
three years.The PUCO has not yet acted upon the application seeking
a reduction of the peak demand reduction requirements. The Ohio Companies are
presently involved in collaborative efforts related to energy efficiency,
including filing applications for approval with the PUCO, as well as other
implementation efforts arising out of the Supplemental Stipulation. On December
15, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed the required three year portfolio plan
seeking approval for the programs they intend to implement to meet the energy
efficiency and peak demand reduction requirements for the 2010-2012
period.The PUCO has set the matter for hearing on March 2, 2010. The
Ohio Companies expect that all costs associated with compliance will be
recoverable from customers.
219
In
October 2009, the PUCO issued additional Entries on Rehearing, modifying certain
of its previous rulesthat set out the manner in which electric
utilities, including the Ohio Companies, will be required to comply with
benchmarks contained in SB221 related to the employment of alternative energy
resources, energy efficiency/peak demand reduction programs as well as
greenhouse gas reporting requirements and changes to long term forecast
reporting requirements. Applications for rehearing filed in mid-November 2009
were granted on December 9, 2009 for the sole purpose of further consideration
of the matters raised in those applications.The PUCO has not yet
issued a substantive Entry on Rehearing.The rules implementing the
requirements of SB221 went into effect on December 10, 2009. The rules set out
the manner in which electric utilities, including the Ohio Companies, will be
required to comply with benchmarks contained in SB221 related to the employment
of alternative energy resources, energy efficiency/peak demand reduction
programs as well as greenhouse gas reporting requirements and carbon dioxide
control planning requirements and changes to long term forecast reporting
requirements. The rules severely restrict the types of renewable energy
resources energy efficiency and peak reduction programs that may be included
toward meeting the statutory goals, which is expected to increase the cost of
compliance for the Ohio Companies' customers. As a result of the rules going
into effect in December 2009, and the PUCOs failure to address certain energy
efficiency applications submitted by the Ohio Companies throughout the year and
the PUCOs directive to postpone the launch of a PUCO-approved energy efficiency
program, the Ohio Companies, on October 27, 2009, submitted an application to
amend their 2009 statutory energy efficiency benchmarks to zero. On January 7,
2010, the PUCO issued an Order granting the Companies request to amend the
energy efficiency benchmarks.
Additionally
under SB221, electric utilities and electric service companies are required to
serve part of their load from renewable energy resources equivalent to 025% of
the KWH they serve in 2009.In August and October 2009, the Ohio
Companies conducted RFPs to secure RECs. The RFPs sought renewable energy RECs,
including solar RECs and RECs generated in Ohio in order to meet the Ohio
Companies' alternative energy requirements set forth in SB221. The RECs acquired
through these two RFPs will be used to help meet the renewable energy
requirements established under SB221 for 2009, 2010 and 2011.On
December 7, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO seeking
a force majeure determination regarding the Ohio Companies compliance with the
2009 solar energy resources benchmark, and seeking a reduction in the
benchmark.The PUCO has not yet ruled on that
application.
On
October 20, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed an MRO to procure electric generation
service for the period beginning June 1, 2011. The proposed MRO would establish
a CBP to secure generation supply for customers who do not shop with an
alternative supplier and would be similar, in all material respects, to the CBP
conducted in May 2009 in that it would procure energy, capacity and certain
transmission services on a slice of system basis. Enhancements to the May 2009
CBP, the MRO would include multiple bidding sessions and multiple products with
different delivery periods for generation supply features which are designed to
reduce potential price volatility and reduce supplier risk and encourage bidder
participation. A technical conference was held on October 29, 2009. Hearings
took place in December and the matter has been fully briefed. Pursuant to SB221,
the PUCO has 90 days from the date of the application to determine whether the
MRO meets certain statutory requirements. Although the Ohio Companies requested
a PUCO determination by January 18, 2010, on February 3, 2010, the PUCO
announced that its determination would be delayed. Under a determination that
such statutory requirements are met, the Ohio Companies would be able to
implement the MRO and conduct the CBP.
C
PENNSYLVANIA
Met-Ed
and Penelec purchase a portion of their PLR and default service requirements
from FES through a fixed-price partial requirements wholesale power sales
agreement. The agreement allows Met-Ed and Penelec to sell the output of NUG
energy to the market and requires FES to provide energy at fixed prices to
replace any NUG energy sold to the extent needed for Met-Ed and Penelec to
satisfy their PLR and default service obligations.
On
February 20, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec filed with the PPUC a generation
procurement plan covering the period January 1, 2011 through May 31, 2013. The
plan is designed to provide adequate and reliable service via a prudent mix of
long-term, short-term and spot market generation supply, as required by Act 129.
The plan proposed a staggered procurement schedule, which varies by customer
class, through the use of a descending clock auction. On August 12, 2009, Met-Ed
and Penelec filed a settlement agreement with the PPUC for the generation
procurement plan covering the period January 1, 2011, through May 31, 2013,
reflecting the settlement on all but two issues. The settlement plan proposes a
staggered procurement schedule, which varies by customer class. On September 2,
2009, the ALJ issued a Recommended Decision RD approving the settlement and
adopted the Met-Ed and Penelecs positions on two reserved issues. On November
6, 2009, the PPUC entered an Order approving the settlement and finding in favor
of Met-Ed and Penelec on the two reserved issues.Generation
procurement began in January 2010.
220
On May
22, 2008, the PPUC approved Met-Ed and Penelec annual updates to the TSC rider
for the period June 1, 2008, through May 31, 2009. The TSCs included a component
for under-recovery of actual transmission costs incurred during the prior period
Met-Ed - $144 million and Penelec - $4 million and transmission cost
projections for June 2008 through May 2009 Met-Ed - $258 million and Penelec 92 million. Met-Ed received PPUC approval for a transition approach that would
recover past under-recovered costs plus carrying charges through the new TSC
over thirty-one months and defer a portion of the projected costs $92 million
plus carrying charges for recovery through future TSCs by December 31, 2010.
Various intervenors filed complaints against those filings. In addition, the
PPUC ordered an investigation to review the reasonableness of Met-Eds TSC,
while at the same time allowing Met-Ed to implement the rider June 1, 2008,
subject to refund. On July 15, 2008, the PPUC directed the ALJ to consolidate
the complaints against Met-Ed with its investigation and a litigation schedule
was adopted. Hearings and briefing for both Met-Ed and Penelec have concluded.
On August 11, 2009, the ALJ issued a Recommended Decision to the PPUC approving
Met-Eds and Penelecs TSCs as filed and dismissing all complaints. Exceptions
by various interveners were filed and reply exceptions were filed by Met-Ed and
Penelec.On January 28, 2010, the PPUC adopted a motion which denies
the recovery of marginal transmission losses through the TSC for the period of
June 1, 2007 through March 31, 2008, and instructs Met-Ed and Penelec to work
with the parties and file a petition to retain any over-collection, with
interest, until 2011 for the purpose of providing mitigation of future rate
increases starting in 2011 for their customers.Met-Ed and Penelec
are now awaiting an order, which is expected to be consistent with the motion.
If so, Met-Ed and Penelec plan to appeal such a decision to the Commonwealth
Court of Pennsylvania. Although the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time, it is the belief of the companies that they should
prevail in any such appeal and therefore expect to fully recover the
approximately $1705 million $1387 million for Met-Ed and $318 million for
Penelec in marginal transmission losses for the period prior to January 1,
2011.
On May
28, 2009, the PPUC approved Met-Eds and Penelecs annual updates to their TSC
rider for the period June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010 subject to the outcome of
the proceeding related to the 2008 TSC filing described above, as required in
connection with the PPUCs January 2007 rate order. For Penelecs customers the
new TSC resulted in an approximate 1% decrease in monthly bills, reflecting
projected PJM transmission costs as well as a reconciliation for costs already
incurred. The TSC for Met-Eds customers increased to recover the additional PJM
charges paid by Met-Ed in the previous year and to reflect updated projected
costs. In order to gradually transition customers to the higher rate, the PPUC
approved Met-Eds proposal to continue to recover the prior period deferrals
allowed in the PPUCs May 2008 Order and defer $575 million of projected costs
to a future TSC to be fully recovered by December 31, 2010. Under this proposal,
monthly bills for Met-Eds customers would increase approximately 94% for the
period June 2009 through May 2010.
Act 129
became effective in 2008 and addresses issues such as: energy efficiency and
peak load reduction; generation procurement; time-of-use rates; smart meters;
and alternative energy. Among other things Act 129 requires utilities to file
with the PPUC an energy efficiency and peak load reduction plan by July 1, 2009,
setting forth the utilities plans to reduce energy consumption by a minimum of
1% and 3% by May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2013, respectively, and to reduce peak
demand by a minimum of 45% by May 31, 2013. On July 1, 2009, Met-Ed, Penelec,
and Penn filed EEC Plans with the PPUC in accordance with Act 129. The
Pennsylvania Companies submitted a supplemental filing on July 31, 2009, to
revise the Total Resource Cost test items in the EEC Plans pursuant to the
PPUCs June 23, 2009 Order. Following an evidentiary hearing and briefing, the
Pennsylvania Companies filed revised EEC Plans on September 21, 2009. In an
October 28, 2009 Order, the PPUC approved in part, and rejected in part, the
Pennsylvania Companies' filing. Following additional filings related to the
plans, including modifications as required by the PPUC, the PPUC issued an order
on January 28, 2010, approving, in part, and rejecting, in part the Pennsylvania
Companies modified plans. The Pennsylvania Companies filed final plans and
tariff revisions on February 5, 2010 consistent with the minor revisions
required by the PPUC.The PPUC must approve or reject the plans
within 60 days.
Act 129
also required utilities to file by August 14, 2009 with the PPUC smart meter
technology procurement and installation plan to provide for the installation of
smart meter technology within 15 years. On August 14, 2009, Met-Ed, Penelec and
Penn jointly filed a Smart Meter Technology Procurement and Installation Plan.
Consistent with the PPUCs rules, this plan proposes a 24-month assessment
period in which the Pennsylvania Companies will assess their needs, select the
necessary technology, secure vendors, train personnel, install and test support
equipment, and establish a cost effective and strategic deployment schedule,
which currently is expected to be completed in fifteen years. Met-Ed, Penelec
and Penn estimate assessment period costs at approximately $295 million, which
the Pennsylvania Companies, in their plan, proposed to recover through an
automatic adjustment clause. A Technical Conference and evidentiary hearings
were held in November 2009. Briefs were filed on December 11, 2009, and Reply
Briefs were filed on December 31, 2009. An Initial Decision was issued by the
presiding ALJ on January 28, 2010.The ALJs Initial Decision
approved the Smart Meter Plan as modified by the ALJ, including: ensuring that
the smart meters to be deployed include the capabilities listed in the PPUCs
Implementation Order; eliminating the provision of interest in the 1307e
reconciliation; providing for the recovery of reasonable and prudent costs minus
resulting savings from installation and use of smart meters; and reflecting that
administrative start-up costs be expensed and the costs incurred for research
and development in the assessment period be capitalized.Exceptions
are due on February 17, 2010, and Reply Exceptions are due on March
1.The Pennsylvania Companies expect the PPUC to act on the plans in
early 2010.

Legislation
addressing rate mitigation and the expiration of rate caps has been introduced
in the legislative session that ended in 2008; several bills addressing these
issues were introduced in the 2009 legislative session. The final form and
impact of such legislation is uncertain.
On
February 26, 2009, the PPUC approved a Voluntary Prepayment Plan requested by
Met-Ed and Penelec that provides an opportunity for residential and small
commercial customers to prepay an amount on their monthly electric bills during
2009 and 2010. Customer prepayments earn interest at 75% and will be used to
reduce electricity charges in 2011 and 2012.
On March
31, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec submitted their 5-year NUG Statement Compliance
filing to the PPUC in accordance with their 1998 Restructuring Settlement.
Met-Ed proposed to reduce its CTC rate for the residential class with a
corresponding increase in the generation rate and the shopping credit, and
Penelec proposed to reduce its CTC rate to zero for all classes with a
corresponding increase in the generation rate and the shopping credit. While
these changes would result in additional annual generation revenue Met-Ed - $27
million and Penelec - $59 million, overall rates would remain unchanged. On
July 30, 2009, the PPUC entered an order approving the 5-year NUG Statement,
approving the reduction of the CTC, and directing Met-Ed and Penelec to file a
tariff supplement implementing this change. On July 31, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec
filed tariff supplements decreasing the CTC rate in compliance with the July 30,
2009 order, and increasing the generation rate in compliance with the
Pennsylvania Companies Restructuring Orders of 1998. On August 14, 2009, the
PPUC issued Secretarial Letters approving Met-Ed and Penelecs compliance
filings.
By
Tentative Order entered September 17, 2009, the PPUC provided for an additional
30-day comment period on whether the Restructuring Settlement allows NUG
over-collection for select and isolated months to be used to reduce non-NUG
stranded costs when a cumulative NUG stranded cost balance
exists.In response to the Tentative Order, the Office of
Small Business Advocate, Office of Consumer Advocate, York County Solid Waste
and Refuse Authority, ARIPPA, the Met-Ed Industrial Users Group and Penelec
Industrial Customer Alliance filed comments objecting to the above accounting
method utilized by Met-Ed and Penelec. Met-Ed and Penelec filed reply comments
on October 26, 2009. On November 5, 2009, the PPUC issued a Secretarial Letter
allowing parties to file reply comments to Met-Ed and Penelecs reply comments
by November 16, 2009, and reply comments were filed by the Office of Consumer
Advocate, ARIPPA, and the Met-Ed Industrial Users Group and Penelec Industrial
Customer Alliance.Met-Ed and Penelec are awaiting further action by
the PPUC.
On
February 8, 2010, Penn filed with the PPUC a generation procurement plan
covering the period June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2013. The plan is designed to
provide adequate and reliable service via a prudent mix of long-term, short-term
and spot market generation supply, as required by Act 129. The plan proposed a
staggered procurement schedule, which varies by customer class, through the use
of a descending clock auction. The PPUC is required to issue an order on the
plan no later than November 8, 2010.

NEW
JERSEY
JCPL
is permitted to defer for future collection from customers the amounts by which
its costs of supplying BGS to non-shopping customers, costs incurred under NUG
agreements, and certain other stranded costs, exceed amounts collected through
BGS and NUGC rates and market sales of NUG energy and capacity. As of December
30, 2009, the accumulated deferred cost balance totaled approximately $98
million.
In
accordance with an April 28, 2004 NJBPU order, JCPL filed testimony on June
7, 2004, supporting continuation of the current level and duration of the
funding of TMI-2 decommissioning costs by New Jersey customers without a
reduction, termination or capping of the funding. TMI-2 is a retired nuclear
facility owned by JCPL. On September 30, 2004, JCPL filed an updated
TMI-2 decommissioning study. This study resulted in an updated total
decommissioning cost estimate of $729 million in 2003 dollars compared to the
estimated $528 million in 2003 dollars from the prior 1995 decommissioning
study. The DPA filed comments on February 28, 2005 requesting that
decommissioning funding be suspended. On March 18, 2005, JCPL filed a
response to those comments. JCPL responded to additional NJBPU staff
discovery requests in May and November 2007 and also submitted comments in the
proceeding in November 2007. A schedule for further NJBPU proceedings has not
yet been set. On March 13, 2009, JCPL filed its annual SBC Petition with
the NJBPU that includes a request for a reduction in the level of recovery of
TMI-2 decommissioning costs based on an updated TMI-2 decommissioning cost
analysis dated January 2009. This matter is currently pending before the
NJBPU.
New
Jersey statutes require that the state periodically undertake a planning
process, known as the EMP, to address energy related issues including energy
security, economic growth, and environmental impact. The EMP is to be developed
with involvement of the Governors Office and the Governors Office of Economic
Growth, and is to be prepared by a Master Plan Committee, which is chaired by
the NJBPU President and includes representatives of several State
departments.
The
EMP was issued on October 22, 2008, establishing five major
goals:
maximize
energy efficiency to achieve a 20% reduction in energy consumption by
2020;
222
reduce
peak demand for electricity by 5,700 MW by
2020;
meet
30% of the states electricity needs with renewable energy by
2020;
examine
smart grid technology and develop additional cogeneration and other
generation resources consistent with the states greenhouse gas targets;
and
invest
in innovative clean energy technologies and businesses to stimulate the
industrys growth in New Jersey.
On
January 28, 2009, the NJBPU adopted an order establishing the general process
and contents of specific EMP plans that must be filed by New Jersey electric and
gas utilities in order to achieve the goals of the EMP. Such utility specific
plans are due to be filed with the NJBPU by July 1, 2010. At this time,
FirstEnergy and JCPL cannot determine the impact, if any, the EMP may have
on their business or operations.
In
support of former New Jersey Governor Corzine Economic Assistance and Recovery
Plan, JCPL announced a proposal to spend approximately $98 million on
infrastructure and energy efficiency projects in 2009. Under the proposal, an
estimated $40 million would be spent on infrastructure projects, including
substation upgrades, new transformers, distribution line re-closers and
automated breaker operations. In addition, approximately $34 million would be
spent implementing new demand response programs as well as expanding on existing
programs. Another $11 million would be spent on energy efficiency, specifically
replacing transformers and capacitor control systems and installing new LED
street lights. The remaining $13 million would be spent on energy efficiency
programs that would complement those currently being offered. The project
relating to expansion of the existing demand response programs was approved by
the NJBPU on August 19, 2009, and implementation began in 2009. Approval for the
$11 million project related to energy efficiency programs intended to complement
those currently being offered was denied by the NJBPU on December 1, 2009.
Implementation of the remaining projects is dependent upon resolution of
regulatory issues between the NJBPU and JCPL including recovery of the
costs associated with the proposal.
On
February 11, 2010, SP downgraded the senior unsecured debt of FirstEnergy
Corp. toBB+.As a result, pursuant to the requirements of
a pre-existing NJBPU order, JCPL filed, on February 17, 2010 a plan
addressing the mitigation of any effect of the downgrade and which provided an
assessment of present and future liquidity necessary to assure JCPLs
continued payment to BGS suppliers.The order also provides that the
NJBPU should: 1 within 10 days of that filing, hold a public hearing to review
the plan and consider the available options and 2 within 30 days of that filing
issue an order with respect to the matter.At this time, the public
hearing has not been scheduled and FirstEnergy and JCPL cannot determine
the impact, if any, these proceedings will have on their
operations.

FERC
MATTERS
Transmission
Service between MISO and PJM
On
November 18, 2004, the FERC issued an order eliminating the through and out rate
for transmission service between the MISO and PJM regions. The FERCs intent was
to eliminate multiple transmission charges for a single transaction between the
MISO and PJM regions. The FERC also ordered MISO, PJM and the transmission
owners within MISO and PJM to submit compliance filings containing a rate
mechanism to recover lost transmission revenues created by elimination of this
charge referred to as the Seams Elimination Cost Adjustment or SECA during a
16-month transition period. The FERC issued orders in 2005 setting the SECA for
hearing. The presiding judge issued an initial decision on August 10, 2006,
rejecting the compliance filings made by MISO, PJM and the transmission owners,
and directing new compliance filings. This decision is subject to review and
approval by the FERC. A final order is pending before the FERC, and in the
meantime, FirstEnergy affiliates have been negotiating and entering into
settlement agreements with other parties in the docket to mitigate the risk of
lower transmission revenue collection associated with an adverse order. On
September 26, 2008, the MISO and PJM transmission owners filed a motion
requesting that the FERC approve the pending settlements and act on the initial
decision. On November 20, 2008, FERC issued an order approving uncontested
settlements, but did not rule on the initial decision. On December 19, 2008, an
additional order was issued approving two contested settlements. On October 29,
2009, FirstEnergy, with another Company, filed an additional settlement
agreement with FERC to resolve their outstanding claims. FirstEnergy is actively
pursuing settlement agreements with other parties to the case.On
December 8, 2009, certain parties sought a writ of mandamus from the DC Circuit
Court of Appeals directing FERC to issue an order on the Initial Decision. The
Court agreed to hold this matter in abeyance based upon FERCs representation to
use good faith efforts to issue a substantive ruling on the initial decision no
later than May 27, 2010. If FERC fails to act, the case will be submitted for
briefing in June. This matter is pending in the Court and the outcome cannot be
predicted.
223
PJM
Transmission Rate
On
January 31, 2005, certain PJM transmission owners made filings with the FERC
pursuant to a settlement agreement previously approved by the FERC. JCPL,
Met-Ed and Penelec were parties to that proceeding and joined in two of the
filings. In the first filing, the settling transmission owners submitted a
filing justifying continuation of their existing rate design within the PJM RTO.
Hearings were held and numerous parties appeared and litigated various issues
concerning PJM rate design, notably AEP, which proposed to create a postage
stamp, or average rate for all high voltage transmission facilities across PJM
and a zonal transmission rate for facilities below 345 kV. AEP proposal would
have the effect of shifting recovery of the costs of high voltage transmission
lines to other transmission zones, including those where JCPL, Met-Ed, and
Penelec serve load. On April 19, 2007, the FERC issued an order Opinion 494
finding that the PJM transmission owners existing license plate or zonal rate
design was just and reasonable and ordered that the current license plate rates
for existing transmission facilities be retained. On the issue of rates for new
transmission facilities, the FERC directed that costs for new transmission
facilities that are rated at 500 kV or higher are to be collected from all
transmission zones throughout the PJM footprint by means of a postage-stamp
rate. Costs for new transmission facilities that are rated at less than 500 kV,
however, are to be allocated on a beneficiary pays basis. The FERC found that
PJMs current beneficiary-pays cost allocation methodology is not sufficiently
detailed and, in a related order that also was issued on April 19, 2007,
directed that hearings be held for the purpose of establishing a just and
reasonable cost allocation methodology for inclusion in PJMs
tariff.
On May
18, 2007, certain parties filed for rehearing of the FERCs April 19, 2007
order. On January 31, 2008, the requests for rehearing were denied. On February
11, 2008, the FERCs April 19, 2007, and January 31, 2008, orders were appealed
to the federal Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The Illinois Commerce
Commission, the PUCO and another party have also appealed these orders to the
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals of these parties and others have
been consolidated for argument in the Seventh Circuit. The Seventh Circuit Court
of Appeals issued a decision on August 6, 2009, that remanded the rate design to
FERC and denied the appeal. A request for rehearing and rehearing en banc by two
Companies was denied by the Seventh Circuit on October 20, 2009. On October 28,
2009, the Seventh Circuit closed its case dockets and returned the case to FERC
for further action on the remand order. In an order dated January 21, 2010, FERC
set the matter for paper hearings meaning that FERC called for parties to
submit comments or written testimony pursuant to the schedule described in the
order. FERC identified nine separate issues for comments, and directed PJM to
file the first round of comments on February 22, 2010, with other parties
submitting responsive comments on April 8, 2010 and May 10, 2010.
The
FERCs orders on PJM rate design prevented the allocation of a portion of the
revenue requirement of existing transmission facilities of other utilities to
JCPL, Met-Ed and Penelec. In addition, the FERCs decision to allocate the
cost of new 500 kV and above transmission facilities on a PJM-wide basis reduces
the cost of future transmission to be recovered from the JCPL, Met-Ed and
Penelec zones. A partial settlement agreement addressing the beneficiary pays
methodology for below 500 kV facilities, but excluding the issue of allocating
new facilities costs to merchant transmission entities, was filed on September
14, 2007. The agreement was supported by the FERCs Trial Staff, and was
certified by the Presiding Judge to the FERC. On July 29, 2008, the FERC issued
an order conditionally approving the settlement. On November 14, 2008, PJM
submitted revisions to its tariff to incorporate cost responsibility assignments
for below 500 kV upgrades included in PJMs Regional Transmission Expansion
Planning process in accordance with the settlement. The remaining merchant
transmission cost allocation issues were the subject of a hearing at the FERC in
May 2008. On November 19, 2009, FERC issued Opinion 503 agreeing that RTEP costs
should be allocated on a pro-rata basis to merchant transmission companies. On
December 22, 2009, a request for a rehearing of FERCs Opinion No. 503 was made.
On January 19, 2010, FERC issued a procedural order noting that FERC would
address the rehearing requests in a future order.
RTO
Consolidation
On
August 17, 2009, FirstEnergy filed an application with the FERC requesting to
consolidate its transmission assets and operations into PJM. Currently,
FirstEnergys transmission assets and operations are divided between PJM and
MISO. The consolidation would make the transmission assets that are part of
ATSI, whose footprint includes the Ohio Companies and Penn, part of PJM. Most of
FirstEnergys transmission assets in Pennsylvania and all of the transmission
assets in New Jersey already operate as a part of PJM. Key elements of the
filing include a Fixed Resource Requirement Plan FRR Plan that describes the
means whereby capacity will be procured and administered as necessary to satisfy
the PJM capacity requirements for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 delivery years; and
also a request that ATSIs transmission customers be excused from the costs for
regional transmission projects that were approved through PJMs RTEP process
prior to ATSIs entry into PJM legacy RTEP costs. Subject to satisfactory
outcomes in the FERC dockets, the integration is expected to be complete on June
1, 2011, to coincide with delivery of power under the next competitive
generation procurement process for the Ohio Companies. To ensure a definitive
ruling at the same time FERC rules on its request to integrate ATSI into PJM, on
October 19, 2009, FirstEnergy filed a related complaint with FERC on the issue
of exempting the ATSI footprint from the legacy RTEP costs.
On
September 4, 2009, the PUCO opened a case to take comments from Ohios
stakeholders regarding the RTO consolidation. FirstEnergy filed extensive
comments in the PUCO case on September 25, 2009, and reply comments on October
13, 2009, and attended a public meeting on September 15, 2009 to answer
questions regarding the RTO consolidation. Several parties have intervened in
the regulatory dockets at the FERC and at the PUCO. Certain interveners have
commented and protested particular elements of the proposed RTO consolidation,
including an exit fee to MISO, integration costs to PJM, and cost-allocations of
future transmission upgrades in PJM and MISO.
224
On
December 17, 2009, FERC issued an order approving, subject to certain future
compliance filings, ATSIs move to PJM. FirstEnergys request to be exempted
from legacy RTEP costs was rejected and its complaint dismissed.
On
December 17, 2009, ATSI executed the PJM Consolidated Transmission Owners
Agreement. On December 18, 2009, the Ohio companies and Penn executed the PJM
Operating Agreement and the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement. Execution of
these agreements committed ATSI and the Ohio Companies and Penns load to moving
into PJM on the schedule approved in the FERC Order.
On
January 15, 2010, the Ohio Companies and Penn submitted a compliance filing
describing the process whereby ATSI-zone load serving entities LSEs can opt
out of the Ohio Companies' and Penn proposed capacity plan for the 2011-12
and 2012-13 delivery years. On January 16, 2010, FirstEnergy filed for
clarification or rehearing of certain issues associated with implementing the
FRR auctions on the proposed schedule. On January 19, 2010, FirstEnergy filed
for rehearing of FERCs decision to impose the legacy RTEP costs on ATSIs
transmission customers. Also on January 19, 2010, several parties, including the
PUCO and the OCC asked for rehearing of parts of FERCs order. None of the
rehearing parties asked FERC to rescind authorization for ATSI to enter PJM.
Instead, parties focused on questions of cost and cost allocation or on alleged
errors in implementing the move. On February 3, 2010, FirstEnergy filed an
answer to the January 19, 2010, rehearing requests of other parties. On February
16, 2010, FirstEnergy submitted a second compliance filing to FERC; the filing
describes communications protocols and performance deficiency penalties for
capacity suppliers that are taken in FRR auctions.
FirstEnergy
will conduct FRR auctions on March 15-19, 2010, for the 2011-12 and 2012-13
delivery years, and will participate in PJMs next base residual auction for
capacity resources for the 2013-2014 delivery years.FirstEnergy
expects to integrate into PJM effective June 1, 2011.
Changes
ordered for PJM Reliability Pricing Model RPM Auction
On May
30, 2008, a group of PJM load-serving entities, state commissions, consumer
advocates, and trade associations referred to collectively as the RPM Buyers
filed a complaint at the FERC against PJM alleging that three of the four
transitional RPM auctions yielded prices that are unjust and unreasonable under
the Federal Power Act. On September 19, 2008, the FERC denied the RPM Buyers
complaint. On December 12, 2008, PJM filed proposed tariff amendments that would
adjust slightly the RPM program. PJM also requested that the FERC conduct a
settlement hearing to address changes to the RPM and suggested that the FERC
should rule on the tariff amendments only if settlement could not be reached in
January 2009. The request for settlement hearings was granted. Settlement had
not been reached by January 9, 2009 and, accordingly, FirstEnergy and other
parties submitted comments on PJMs proposed tariff amendments. On January 15,
2009, the Chief Judge issued an order terminating settlement discussions. On
February 9, 2009, PJM and a group of stakeholders submitted an offer of
settlement, which used the PJM December 12, 2008 filing as its starting point,
and stated that unless otherwise specified, provisions filed by PJM on December
12, 2008 apply.
On March
26, 2009, the FERC accepted in part, and rejected in part, tariff provisions
submitted by PJM, revising certain parts of its RPM. It ordered changes included
making incremental improvements to RPM and clarification on certain aspects of
the March 26, 2009 Order. On April 27, 2009, PJM submitted a compliance filing
addressing the changes the FERC ordered in the March 26, 2009 Order;
subsequently, numerous parties filed requests for rehearing of the March 26,
2009 Order. On June 18, 2009, the FERC denied rehearing and request for oral
argument of the March 26, 2009 Order.
PJM has
reconvened the Capacity Market Evolution Committee CMEC and has scheduled a
CMEC Long-Term Issues Symposium to address near-term changes directed by the
March 26, 2009 Order and other long-term issues not addressed in the February
2009 settlement. PJM made a compliance filing on September 1, 2009,
incorporating tariff changes directed by the March 26, 2009 Order. The tariff
changes were approved by the FERC in an order issued on October 30, 2009, and
are effective November 1, 2009. The CMEC continues to work to address additional
compliance items directed by the March 26, 2009 Order. On December 1, 2009, PJM
informed FERC that PJM would file a scarcity-pricing design with FERC on April
1, 2010.
MISO
Resource Adequacy Proposal
MISO
made a filing on December 28, 2007 that would create an enforceable planning
reserve requirement in the MISO tariff for load-serving entities such as the
Ohio Companies, Penn and FES. This requirement was proposed to become effective
for the planning year beginning June 1, 2009. The filing would permit MISO to
establish the reserve margin requirement for load-serving entities based upon a
one day loss of load in ten years standard, unless the state utility regulatory
agency establishes a different planning reserve for load-serving entities in its
state. FirstEnergy believes the proposal promotes a mechanism that will result
in commitments from both load-serving entities and resources, including both
generation and demand side resources that are necessary for reliable resource
adequacy and planning in the MISO footprint. The FERC conditionally approved
MISOs Resource Adequacy proposal on March 26, 2008. On June 25, 2008, MISO
submitted a second compliance filing establishing the enforcement mechanism for
the reserve margin requirement which establishes deficiency payments for
load-serving entities that do not meet the resource adequacy requirements.
Numerous parties, including FirstEnergy, protested this filing.
225
On
October 20, 2008, the FERC issued three orders essentially permitting the MISO
Resource Adequacy program to proceed with some modifications. First, the FERC
accepted MISO financial settlement approach for enforcement of Resource
Adequacy subject to a compliance filing modifying the cost of new entry penalty.
Second, the FERC conditionally accepted MISO compliance filing on the
qualifications for purchased power agreements to be capacity resources, load
forecasting, loss of load expectation, and planning reserve zones. Additional
compliance filings were directed on accreditation of load modifying resources
and price responsive demand. Finally, the FERC largely denied rehearing of its
March 26 order with the exception of issues related to behind the meter
resources and certain ministerial matters. On April 16, 2009, the FERC issued an
additional order on rehearing and compliance, approving MISOs proposed
financial settlement provision for Resource Adequacy. The MISO Resource Adequacy
program was implemented as planned and became effective on June 1, 2009, the
beginning of the MISO planning year. On June 17, 2009, MISO submitted a
compliance filing in response to the FERCs April 16, 2009 order directing it to
address, among others, various market monitoring and mitigation issues. On July
8, 2009, various parties submitted comments on and protests to MISOs compliance
filing. FirstEnergy submitted comments identifying specific aspects of the
MISOs and Independent Market Monitors proposals for market monitoring and
mitigation and other issues that it believes the FERC should address and
clarify. On October 23, 2009, FERC issued an order approving a MISO compliance
filing that revised its tariff to provide for netting of demand resources, but
prohibiting the netting of behind-the-meter generation.
FES
Sales to Affiliates
FES
supplied all of the power requirements for the Ohio Companies pursuant to a
Power Supply Agreement that ended on December 31, 2008. On January 2, 2009, FES
signed an agreement to provide 75% of the Ohio Companies power requirements for
the period January 5, 2009 through March 31, 2009. Subsequently, FES signed an
agreement to provide 100% of the Ohio Companies power requirements for the
period April 1, 2009 through May 31, 2009. On March 4, 2009, the PUCO issued an
order approving these two affiliate sales agreements. FERC authorization for
these affiliate sales was by means of a December 23, 2008 waiver of restrictions
on affiliate sales without prior approval of the FERC. Rehearing was denied on
July 31, 2009. On October 19, 2009, FERC accepted FirstEnergys revised
tariffs.
On May
13-14, 2009, FES participated in a descending clock auction for PLR service
administered by the Ohio Companies and their consultant, CRA International. FES
won 51 tranches in the auction, and entered into a Master SSO Supply Agreement
to provide capacity, energy, ancillary services and transmission to the Ohio
Companies for a two-year period beginning June 1, 2009.Other winning
suppliers have assigned their Master SSO Supply Agreements to FES, five of which
were effective in June, two more in July, four more in August and ten more in
September, 2009.FES also supplies power used by Constellation to
serve an additional five tranches.As a result of these arrangements,
FES serves 77 tranches, or 77% of the PLR load of the Ohio
Companies.
On
November 3, 2009, FES, Met-Ed, Penelec and Waverly restated their partial
requirements power purchase agreement for 2010. The Fourth Restated Partial
Requirements Agreement PRA continues to limit the amount of capacity resources
required to be supplied by FES to 3,544 MW, but requires FES to supply
essentially all of Met-Ed, Penelec, and Waverlys energy requirements in 2010.
Under the Fourth Restated Partial Requirements Agreement, Met-Ed, Penelec, and
Waverly Buyers assigned 1,300 MW of existing energy purchases to FES to assist
it in supplying Buyers power supply requirements and managing congestion
expenses. FES can either sell the assigned power from the third party into the
market or use it to serve the Met-Ed/Penelec load. FES is responsible for
obtaining additional power supplies in the event of failure of supply of the
assigned energy purchase contracts. Prices for the power sold by FES under the
Fourth Restated Partial Requirements Agreement were increased to $4277 and
$4442, respectively for Met-Ed and Penelec. In addition, FES agreed to
reimburse Met-Ed and Penelec, respectively, for congestion expenses and marginal
losses in excess of $208 million and $79 million, respectively, as billed by PJM
in 2010, and associated with delivery of power by FES under the Fourth Restated
Partial Requirements Agreement. The Fourth Restated Partial Requirements
Agreement terminates at the end of 2010.

CAPITALIZATION
A
COMMON
STOCK
Retained
Earnings and Dividends
As of
December 31, 2009, FirstEnergy unrestricted retained earnings were $45
billion. Dividends declared in 2009 were $220, which included four quarterly
dividends of $055 per share paid in the second, third and fourth quarters of
2009 and payable in the first quarter of 2010. Dividends declared in 2008 were
$220, which included four quarterly dividends of $055 per share paid in the
second, third and fourth quarters of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. The amount
and timing of all dividend declarations are subject to the discretion of the
Board of Directors and its consideration of business conditions, results of
operations, financial condition and other factors.
226
In
addition to paying dividends from retained earnings, each of FirstEnergys
electric utility subsidiaries has authorization from the FERC to pay cash
dividends to FirstEnergy from paid-in capital accounts, as long as its equity to
total capitalization ratio without consideration of retained earnings remains
above 35%. The articles of incorporation, indentures and various other
agreements relating to the long-term debt of certain FirstEnergy subsidiaries
contain provisions that could further restrict the payment of dividends on their
common stock. None of these provisions materially restricted FirstEnergys
subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends to FirstEnergy as of December 31,
2009.

Securitized
Transition Bonds
The
consolidated financial statements of FirstEnergy and JCPL include the
accounts of JCPL Transition Funding and JCPL Transition Funding II,
wholly owned limited liability companies of JCPL. In June 2002, JCPL
Transition Funding sold $320 million of transition bonds to securitize the
recovery of JCPL bondable stranded costs associated with the previously
divested Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station. In August 2006, JCPL
Transition Funding II sold $182 million of transition bonds to securitize the
recovery of deferred costs associated with JCPLs supply of
BGS.
JCPL
did not purchase and does not own any of the transition bonds, which are
included as long-term debt on FirstEnergy and JCPL Consolidated Balance
Sheets. As of December 31, 2009, $340 million of the transition bonds were
outstanding. The transition bonds are the sole obligations of JCPL
Transition Funding and JCPL Transition Funding II and are collateralized by
each companys equity and assets, which consist primarily of bondable transition
property.
Bondable
transition property represents the irrevocable right under New Jersey law of a
utility company to charge, collect and receive from its customers, through a
non-bypassable TBC, the principal amount and interest on transition bonds and
other fees and expenses associated with their issuance. JCPL sold its
bondable transition property to JCPL Transition Funding and JCPL
Transition Funding II and, as servicer, manages and administers the bondable
transition property, including the billing, collection and remittance of the
TBC, pursuant to separate servicing agreements with JCPL Transition Funding
and JCPL Transition Funding II. For the two series of transition bonds,
JCPL is entitled to aggregate annual servicing fees of up to $628,000 that
are payable from TBC collections.
Other
Long-term Debt
FGCO,
NGC and each of the Utilities, except for JCPL, have a first mortgage
indenture under which they can issue FMBs secured by a direct first mortgage
lien on substantially all of their property and franchises, other than
specifically excepted property.
FirstEnergy
and its subsidiaries have various debt covenants under their respective
financing arrangements. The most restrictive of the debt covenants relate to the
nonpayment of interest and/or principal on debt and the maintenance of certain
financial ratios. There also exist cross-default provisions in a number of the
respective financing arrangements of FirstEnergy, FES, FGCO, NGC and the
Utilities. These provisions generally trigger a default in the applicable
financing arrangement of an entity if it or any of its significant subsidiaries
defaults under another financing arrangement of a certain principal amount,
typically $50 million. Although such defaults by any of the Utilities will
generally cross-default FirstEnergy financing arrangements containing these
provisions, defaults by FirstEnergy will not generally cross-default applicable
financing arrangements of any of the Utilities. Defaults by any of FES, FGCO or
NGC will generally cross-default to applicable financing arrangements of
FirstEnergy and, due to the existence of guarantees by FirstEnergy of certain
financing arrangements of FES, FGCO and NGC, defaults by FirstEnergy will
generally cross-default FES, FGCO and NGC financing arrangements containing
these provisions. Cross-default provisions are not typically found in any of the
senior note or FMBs of FirstEnergy or the Utilities.
Based on
the amount of FMBs authenticated by the respective mortgage bond trustees
through December 31, 2009, the Utilities annual sinking fund requirement for
all FMB issued under the various mortgage indentures amounted to $35 million
Penn - $6 million, Met-Ed - $8 million and Penelec - $21 million. Penn expects
to meet its 2010 annual sinking fund requirement with a replacement credit under
its mortgage indenture. Met-Ed and Penelec could fulfill their sinking fund
obligations by providing bondable property additions, previously retired FMBs or
cash to the respective mortgage bond trustees.
As of
December 31, 2009, FirstEnergys currently payable long-term debt includes
approximately $16 billion FES - $15 billion, Met-Ed - $29 million and Penelec
- - $45 million of variable interest rate PCRBs, the bondholders of which are
entitled to the benefit of irrevocable direct pay bank LOCs. The interest rates
on the PCRBs are reset daily or weekly. Bondholders can tender their PCRBs for
mandatory purchase prior to maturity with the purchase price payable from
remarketing proceeds, or if the PCRBs are not successfully remarketed, by
drawings on the irrevocable direct pay LOCs. The subsidiary obligor is required
to reimburse the applicable LOC bank for any such drawings or, if the LOC bank
fails to honor its LOC for any reason, must itself pay the purchase price. Prior
to the third quarter of 2008, FirstEnergy subsidiaries had not experienced any
unsuccessful remarketings of these variable-rate PCRBs. Coincident with recent
disruptions in the variable-rate demand bond and capital markets generally,
certain of the PCRBs had been tendered by bondholders to the trustee. As of
January 31, 2009, all PCRBs that had been tendered were successfully
remarketed.
228
In 2009,
holders of approximately $434 million of LOC-supported PCRBs of OE and NGC were
notified that the applicable Wachovia Bank LOCs were set to expire. As a result,
these PCRBs were subject to mandatory purchase at a price equal to the principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which OE and NGC funded through
short-term borrowings. FGCO remarketed $100 million of those PCRBs, which were
previously held by OE and NGC and remarketed the remaining $334 million of
PCRBs, of which $170 million was remarketed in fixed interest rate modes and
secured by FMBs, thereby eliminating the need for third-party credit support.
Also during 2009, FGCO and NGC remarketed approximately $329 million of other
PCRBs supported by LOCs set to expire in 2009. Those PCRBs were also remarketed
in fixed interest rate modes and secured by FMBs, thereby eliminating the need
for third-party credit support. FGCO and NGC delivered FMBs to certain LOC banks
listed above in connection with amendments to existing LOC and reimbursement
agreements supporting twelve other series of PCRBs as described below and
pledged FMBs to the applicable trustee under six separate series of PCRBs. On
August 14, 2009, $177 million of non-LOC supported fixed rate PCRBs were issued
and sold on behalf of FGCO to pay a portion of the cost of acquiring,
constructing and installing air quality facilities at its W.H. Sammis Generating
Station.

Obligations
to repay certain PCRBs are secured by several series of FMBs. Certain PCRBs are
entitled to the benefit of irrevocable bank LOCs of $16 billion as of December
31, 2009, or noncancelable municipal bond insurance of $38 million as of
December 31, 2009, to pay principal of, or interest on, the applicable PCRBs. To
the extent that drawings are made under the LOCs or the insurance, FGCO, NGC and
the Utilities are entitled to a credit against their obligation to repay those
bonds. FGCO, NGC and the Utilities pay annual fees of 035% to 330% of the
amounts of the LOCs to the issuing banks and are obligated to reimburse the
banks or insurers, as the case may be, for any drawings thereunder. The insurers
hold FMBs as security for such reimbursement obligations. These amounts and
percentages for FirstEnergy, FES and the Utilities are as follows:

OE has
LOCs of $200 million and $134 million in connection with the sale and leaseback
of Beaver Valley Unit 2 and Perry Unit 1, respectively. In 2004, OE entered into
a Credit Agreement pursuant to which a standby LOC was issued in support of
approximately $236 million of the Beaver Valley Unit 2 LOCs and the issuer of
the standby LOC obtained the right to pledge or assign participations in OE
reimbursement obligations under the credit agreement to a trust. The trust then
issued and sold trust certificates to institutional investors that were designed
to be the credit equivalent of an investment directly in OE. In 2009, these LOCs
were renewed in the amount of $145 million.

13.ASSET
RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
FirstEnergy
has recognized applicable legal obligations for AROs and their associated cost
for nuclear power plant decommissioning, reclamation of a sludge disposal pond
and closure of two coal ash disposal sites. In addition, FirstEnergy has
recognized conditional retirement obligations primarily for asbestos
remediation.
The ARO
liabilities for FES, OE and TE primarily relate to the decommissioning of the
Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear generating facilities OE for its
leasehold interest in Beaver Valley Unit 2 and Perry and TE for its leasehold
interest in Beaver Valley Unit 2. The ARO liabilities for JCPL, Met-Ed and
Penelec primarily relate to the decommissioning of the TMI-2 nuclear generating
facility. FES and the Utilities use an expected cash flow approach to measure
the fair value of their nuclear decommissioning AROs.
FirstEnergy,
FES and the Utilities maintain nuclear decommissioning trust funds that are
legally restricted for purposes of settling the nuclear decommissioning ARO. The
fair values of the decommissioning trust assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008
were as follows:

Accounting
standards for conditional retirement obligations associated with tangible
long-lived assets require recognition of the fair value of a liability for an
ARO in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate can made,
even though there may be uncertainty about timing or method of settlement. When
settlement is conditional on a future event occurring, it is reflected in the
measurement of the liability, not in the recognition of the
liability.

14.SHORT-TERM
BORROWINGS AND BANK LINES OF CREDIT
FirstEnergy
had approximately $12 billion of short-term indebtedness as of December 31,
2009, comprised of $11 billion of borrowings under a $275 billion revolving
line of credit, $100 million of other bank borrowings and $31 million of
currently payable notes. Total short-term bank lines of committed credit to
FirstEnergy and the Utilities as of January 31, 2010 were approximately $34
billion of which $17billion was unused and
available.
FirstEnergy,
along with certain of its subsidiaries, are parties to a $275 billion five-year
revolving credit facility. FirstEnergy has the ability to request an increase in
the total commitments available under this facility up to a maximum of $325
billion, subject to the discretion of each lender to provide additional
commitments. Commitments under the facility are available until August 24, 2012,
unless the lenders agree, at the request of the borrowers, to an unlimited
number of additional one-year extensions. Generally, borrowings under the
facility must be repaid within 364 days. Available amounts for each borrower are
subject to a specified sub-limit, as well as applicable regulatory and other
limitations. The annual facility fee is 0125%.
230
The
following table summarizes the borrowing sub-limits for each borrower under the
facility, as well as the limitations on short-term indebtedness applicable to
each borrower under current regulatory approvals and applicable statutory and/or

The
borrowing sub-limit for ATSI may be increased up to $100 million by
delivering notice to the administrative agent that ATSI has received
regulatory approval to have short-term borrowings up to the same
amount.
The
regulated companies also have the ability to borrow from each other and
FirstEnergy to meet their short-term working capital requirements. A similar but
separate arrangement exists among the unregulated companies. FESC administers
these two money pools and tracks FirstEnergys surplus funds and those of the
respective regulated and unregulated subsidiaries, as well as proceeds available
from bank borrowings. Companies receiving a loan under the money pool agreements
must repay the principal amount of the loan, together with accrued interest,
within 364 days of borrowing the funds. The rate of interest is the same for
each company receiving a loan from their respective pool and is based on the
average cost of funds available through the pool. The average interest rate for
borrowings in 2009 was 072% for the regulated companies money pool and 090%
for the unregulated companies money pool.
The
weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

231
The
Utilities, with the exception of TE, JCPL and Penn, each have a wholly
owned subsidiary whose borrowings are secured by customer accounts receivable
purchased from its respective parent company. The CEI subsidiary borrowings
are also secured by customer accounts receivable purchased from TE. Each
subsidiary company has its own receivables financing arrangement and, as a
separate legal entity with separate creditors, would have to satisfy its
obligations to creditors before any of its remaining assets could be available
to its parent company. In December 2009, the Met-Ed and Penelec Funding LLC
receivables programs were renewed for a 364-day period. The Penn Power Funding
LLC program was not renewed in 2009 and was thereafter terminated effective
December 17, 2009. The receivables financing borrowing commitment by company are
shown in the following table. There were no outstanding borrowings as of

COMMITMENTS,
GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES
A
NUCLEAR
INSURANCE
The
Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability which can be assessed with
respect to a nuclear power plant to $126 billion assuming 104 units licensed
to operate for a single nuclear incident, which amount is covered by: i
private insurance amounting to $375 million; and ii $122 billion provided by
an industry retrospective rating plan required by the NRC pursuant thereto.
Under such retrospective rating plan, in the event of a nuclear incident at any
unit in the United States resulting in losses in excess of private insurance, up
to $118 million but not more than $18 million per unit per year in the event of
more than one incident must be contributed for each nuclear unit licensed to
operate in the country by the licensees thereof to cover liabilities arising out
of the incident. Based on their present nuclear ownership and leasehold
interests, FirstEnergys maximum potential assessment under these provisions
would be $470 million OE-$40 million, NGC-$408 million, and TE-$22 million per
incident but not more than $70 million OE-$6 million, NGC-$61 million, and
TE-$3 million in any one year for each incident.
In
addition to the public liability insurance provided pursuant to the
Price-Anderson Act, FirstEnergy has also obtained insurance coverage in limited
amounts for economic loss and property damage arising out of nuclear incidents.
FirstEnergy is a member of NEIL, which provides coverage NEIL I for the extra
expense of replacement power incurred due to prolonged accidental outages of
nuclear units. Under NEIL I, FirstEnergys subsidiaries have policies, renewable
yearly, corresponding to their respective nuclear interests, which provide an
aggregate indemnity of up to approximately $560 million OE-$48 million,
NGC-$486 million, TE-$26 million for replacement power costs incurred during an
outage after an initial 20-week waiting period. Members of NEIL I pay annual
premiums and are subject to assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds
available to the insurer. FirstEnergys present maximum aggregate assessment for
incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy year would
be approximately $3 million NGC-$3 million.
FirstEnergy
is insured as to its respective nuclear interests under property damage
insurance provided by NEIL to the operating company for each plant. Under these
arrangements, up to $28 billion of coverage for decontamination costs,
decommissioning costs, debris removal and repair and/or replacement of property
is provided. FirstEnergy pays annual premiums for this coverage and is liable
for retrospective assessments of up to approximately $60 million OE-$6 million,
NGC-$51 million, TE-$2 million, Met Ed, Penelec and JCPL-$1 million in
total during a policy year.
FirstEnergy
intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as described above as long
as it is available. To the extent that replacement power, property damage,
decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such
costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of FirstEnergys plants exceed the
policy limits of the insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the
extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be covered by FirstEnergys
insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance becomes unavailable in the
future, FirstEnergy would remain at risk for such costs.
B
GUARANTEES
AND OTHER ASSURANCES
As part
of normal business activities, FirstEnergy enters into various agreements on
behalf of its subsidiaries to provide financial or performance assurances to
third parties. These agreements include contract guarantees, surety bonds and
LOCs. As of December 31, 2009, outstanding guarantees and other assurances
aggregated approximately $42 billion, consisting of parental guarantees - $10
billion, subsidiaries guarantees - $26 billion, surety bonds - $01 billion
and LOCs - $05 billion.
232
FirstEnergy
guarantees energy and energy-related payments of its subsidiaries involved in
energy commodity activities principally to facilitate or hedge normal physical
transactions involving electricity, gas, emission allowances and coal.
FirstEnergy also provides guarantees to various providers of credit support for
the financing or refinancing by subsidiaries of costs related to the acquisition
of property, plant and equipment. These agreements legally obligate FirstEnergy
to fulfill the obligations of those subsidiaries directly involved in energy and
energy-related transactions or financing where the law might otherwise limit the
counterparties' claims. If demands of a counterparty were to exceed the ability
of a subsidiary to satisfy existing obligations, FirstEnergy guarantee enables
the counterparty legal claim to be satisfied by other FirstEnergy assets. The
likelihood is remote that such parental guarantees of $04 billion included in
the $10 billion discussed above as of December 31, 2009 would increase amounts
otherwise payable by FirstEnergy to meet its obligations incurred in connection
with financings and ongoing energy and energy-related activities.
While
these types of guarantees are normally parental commitments for the future
payment of subsidiary obligations, subsequent to the occurrence of a credit
rating downgrade or material adverse event, the immediate posting of cash
collateral, provision of an LOC or accelerated payments may be required of the
subsidiary. On February 11, 2010, SP issued a report lowering FirstEnergys
and its subsidiaries credit ratings by one notch, while maintaining its stable
outlook. As a result, FirstEnergy may be required to post up to $48 million of
collateral. Moody and Fitch affirmed the ratings and stable outlook of
FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries on February 11, 2010. As of December 31, 2009,
FirstEnergy maximum exposure under these collateral provisions was $648
million, consisting of $43 million due to material adverse event contractual
clauses, $98 million due to an acceleration of payment or funding obligation,
and $507 million due to a below investment grade credit rating including the $48
million related to the credit rating downgrade by SP on February 11, 2010.
Additionally, stress case conditions of a credit rating downgrade or material
adverse event and hypothetical adverse price movements in the underlying
commodity markets would increase this amount to $807 million, consisting of $51
million due to material adverse event contractual clauses, $98 million related
to an acceleration of payment or funding obligation, and $658 million due to a
below investment grade credit rating.
Most of
FirstEnergy surety bonds are backed by various indemnities common within the
insurance industry. Surety bonds and related guarantees of $101 million provide
additional assurance to outside parties that contractual and statutory
obligations will be met in a number of areas including construction contracts,
environmental commitments and various retail transactions.
In
addition to guarantees and surety bonds, FES contracts, including power
contracts with affiliates awarded through competitive bidding processes,
typically contain margining provisions which require the posting of cash or LOCs
in amounts determined by future power price movements. Based on FES power
portfolio as of December 31, 2009, and forward prices as of that date, FES had
$179 million outstanding in margining accounts. Under a hypothetical adverse
change in forward prices 95% confidence level change in forward prices over a
one year time horizon, FES would be required to post an additional $129
million. Depending on the volume of forward contracts entered and future price
movements, FES could be required to post higher amounts for
margining.
In July
2007, FGCO completed a sale and leaseback transaction for its 93825% undivided
interest in Bruce Mansfield Unit 1. FES has unconditionally and irrevocably
guaranteed all of FGCOs obligations under each of the leases see Note 7. The
related lessor notes and pass through certificates are not guaranteed by FES or
FGCO, but the notes are secured by, among other things, each lessor trusts
undivided interest in Unit 1, rights and interests under the applicable lease
and rights and interests under other related agreements, including FES lease
guaranty.
FES
debt obligations are generally guaranteed by its subsidiaries, FGCO and NGC,
pursuant to guarantees entered into on March 26, 2007. Similar guarantees were
entered into on that date pursuant to which FES guaranteed the debt obligations
of each of FGCO and NGC. Accordingly, present and future holders of indebtedness
of FES, FGCO and NGC will have claims against each of FES, FGCO and NGC
regardless of whether their primary obligor is FES, FGCO or NGC.
C
ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS
Various
federal, state and local authorities regulate FirstEnergy with regard to air and
water quality and other environmental matters. The effects of compliance on
FirstEnergy with regard to environmental matters could have a material adverse
effect on FirstEnergy earnings and competitive position to the extent that it
competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and, therefore,
do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure to comply,
with such regulations.
FirstEnergy
accrues environmental liabilities only when it concludes that it is probable
that it has an obligation for such costs and can reasonably estimate the amount
of such costs. Unasserted claims are reflected in FirstEnergys determination of
environmental liabilities and are accrued in the period that they become both
probable and reasonably estimable.
233
Clean
Air Act Compliance
FirstEnergy
is required to meet federally-approved SO2 emissions
regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in the shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to $37,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim enforcement policy for
SO2
regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based on a 30-day averaging
period. FirstEnergy believes it is currently in compliance with this policy, but
cannot predict what action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the
interim enforcement policy.
FirstEnergy
complies with SO2 reduction
requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 by burning lower-sulfur
fuel, generating more electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using
emission allowances. NOX reductions
required by the 1990 Amendments are being achieved through combustion controls,
the generation of more electricity at lower-emitting plants, and/or using
emission allowances. In September 1998, the EPA finalized regulations requiring
additional NOX reductions
at FirstEnergy facilities. The EPA NOX Transport
Rule imposes uniform reductions of NOX emissions
an approximate 85% reduction in utility plant NOX emissions
from projected 2007 emissions across a region of nineteen states including
Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia based
on a conclusion that such NOX emissions
are contributing significantly to ozone levels in the eastern United States.
FirstEnergy believes its facilities are also complying with the NOX budgets
established under SIPs through combustion controls and post-combustion controls,
including Selective Catalytic Reduction and SNCR systems, and/or using emission
allowances.
In 1999
and 2000, the EPA issued an NOV and the DOJ filed a civil complaint against OE
and Penn based on operation and maintenance of the W. H. Sammis Plant Sammis
NSR Litigation and filed similar complaints involving 44 other U.S. power
plants. This case and seven other similar cases are referred to as the NSR
cases. OEs and Penns settlement with the EPA, the DOJ and three states
Connecticut, New Jersey and New York that resolved all issues related to the
Sammis NSR litigation was approved by the Court on July 11, 2005. This
settlement agreement, in the form of a consent decree, requires reductions of
NOX
and SO2 emissions
at the Sammis, Burger, Eastlake and Mansfield coal-fired plants through the
installation of pollution control devices or repowering and provides for
stipulated penalties for failure to install and operate such pollution controls
or complete repowering in accordance with that agreement. Capital expenditures
necessary to complete requirements of the Sammis NSR Litigation consent decree,
including repowering Burger Units 4 and 5 for biomass fuel consumption, are
currently estimated to be $399 million for 2010-2012.
In
October 2007, PennFuture and three of its members filed a citizen suit under the
federal CAA, alleging violations of air pollution laws at the Bruce Mansfield
Plant, including opacity limitations, in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Pennsylvania. In July 2008, three additional complaints
were filed against FGCO in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania seeking damages based on Bruce Mansfield Plant air emissions. In
addition to seeking damages, two of the three complaints seek to enjoin the
Bruce Mansfield Plant from operating except in a safe, responsible, prudent and
proper manner, one being a complaint filed on behalf of twenty-one individuals
and the other being a class action complaint, seeking certification as a class
action with the eight named plaintiffs as the class representatives. On October
16, 2009, a settlement reached with PennFuture and one of the three individual
complainants was approved by the Court, which dismissed the claims of PennFuture
and of the settling individual. The other two non-settling individuals are now
represented by counsel handling the three cases filed in July 2008. FGCO
believes those claims are without merit and intends to defend itself against the
allegations made in those three complaints. The Pennsylvania Department of
Health, under a Cooperative Agreement with the Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry, completed a Health Consultation regarding the Mansfield Plant
and issued a report dated March 31, 2009, which concluded there is insufficient
sampling data to determine if any public health threat exists for area residents
due to emissions from the Mansfield Plant. The report recommended additional air
monitoring and sample analysis in the vicinity of the Mansfield Plant, which the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has completed.
In
December 2007, the state of New Jersey filed a CAA citizen suit alleging NSR
violations at the Portland Generation Station against Reliant the current owner
and operator, Sithe Energy the purchaser of the Portland Station from Met-Ed
in 1999, GPU and Met-Ed. On October 30, 2008, the state of Connecticut filed a
Motion to Intervene, which the Court granted on March 24, 2009. Specifically,
Connecticut and New Jersey allege that modifications at Portland Units 1 and 2
occurred between 1980 and 2005 without preconstruction NSR or permitting under
the CAA PSD program, and seek injunctive relief, penalties, attorney fees and
mitigation of the harm caused by excess emissions. The scope of Met-Eds
indemnity obligation to and from Sithe Energy is disputed. Met-Ed filed a Motion
to Dismiss the claims in New Jerseys Amended Complaint and Connecticuts
Complaint in February and September of 2009, respectively. The Court granted
Met-Ed motion to dismiss New Jerseys and Connecticuts claims for injunctive
relief against Met-Ed, but denied Met-Eds motion to dismiss the claims for
civil penalties on statute of limitations grounds in order to allow the states
to prove either that the application of the discovery rule or the doctrine of
equitable tolling bars application of the statute of limitations.
In
January 2009, the EPA issued a NOV to Reliant alleging NSR violations at the
Portland Generation Station based on modifications dating back to 1986. Met-Ed
is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. The EPAs January 2009, NOV
also alleged NSR violations at the Keystone and Shawville Stations based on
modifications dating back to 1984. JCPL, as the former owner of 1667% of
the Keystone Station, and Penelec, as former owner and operator of the Shawville
Station, are unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
234
In June
2008, the EPA issued a Notice and Finding of Violation to Mission Energy
Westside, Inc. alleging that modifications at the Homer City Power Station
occurred since 1988 to the present without preconstruction NSR or permitting
under the CAA PSD program. Mission Energy is seeking indemnification from
Penelec, the co-owner along with New York State Electric and Gas Company and
operator of the Homer City Power Station prior to its sale in 1999. The scope of
Penelecs indemnity obligation to and from Mission Energy is disputed. Penelec
is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
In
August 2009, the EPA issued a Finding of Violation and NOV alleging violations
of the CAA and Ohio regulations, including the PSD, NNSR, and Title V
regulations at the Eastlake, Lakeshore, Bay Shore, and Ashtabula generating
plants. The EPAs NOV alleges equipment replacements occurring during
maintenance outages dating back to 1990 triggered the pre-construction
permitting requirements under the PSD and NNSR programs. In September 2009, FGCO
received an information request pursuant to Section 114a of the CAA requesting
certain operating and maintenance information and planning information regarding
the Eastlake, Lake Shore, Bay Shore and Ashtabula generating plants. On November
3, 2009, FGCO received a letter providing notification that the EPA is
evaluating whether certain scheduled maintenance at the Eastlake generating
plant may constitute a major modification under the NSR provision of the CAA. On
December 23, 2009, FGCO received another information request regarding emission
projections for the Eastlake generating plant pursuant to Section 114a of the
CAA. FGCO intends to comply with the CAA, including EPAs information requests,
but, at this time, is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. A June 2006
finding of violation and NOV in which EPA alleged CAA violations at the Bay
Shore Generating Plant remains unresolved and FGCO is unable to predict the
outcome of such matter.
In
August 2008, FirstEnergy received a request from the EPA for information
pursuant to Section 114a of the CAA for certain operating and maintenance
information regarding its formerly-owned Avon Lake and Niles generating plants,
as well as a copy of a nearly identical request directed to the current owner,
Reliant Energy, to allow the EPA to determine whether these generating sources
are complying with the NSR provisions of the CAA. FirstEnergy intends to fully
comply with the EPAs information request, but, at this time, is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter.
National
Ambient Air Quality Standards
In March
2005, the EPA finalized CAIR, covering a total of 28 states including Michigan,
New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, based on
proposed findings that air emissions from 28 eastern states and the District of
Columbia significantly contribute to non-attainment of the NAAQS for fine
particles and/or the 8-hour ozone NAAQS in other states. CAIR requires
reductions of NOX and
SO2
emissions in two phases Phase I in 2009 for NOX, 2010 for
SO2
and Phase II in 2015 for both NOX and
SO2,
ultimately capping SO2 emissions
in affected states to 25 million tons annually and NOX emissions
to 13 million tons annually. CAIR was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia and on July 11, 2008, the Court vacated CAIR in
its entirety and directed the EPA to redo its analysis from the ground up. In
September 2008, the EPA, utility, mining and certain environmental advocacy
organizations petitioned the Court for a rehearing to reconsider its ruling
vacating CAIR. In December 2008, the Court reconsidered its prior ruling and
allowed CAIR to remain in effect to temporarily preserve its environmental
values until the EPA replaces CAIR with a new rule consistent with the Courts
July 11, 2008 opinion. On July 10, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled in a different case that a cap-and-trade program
similar to CAIR, called the NOX SIP Call,
cannot be used to satisfy certain CAA requirements known as reasonably
available control technology for areas in non-attainment under the 8-hour
ozone NAAQS. FGCO future cost of compliance with these regulations may be
substantial and will depend, in part, on the action taken by the EPA in response
to the Courts ruling.
Mercury
Emissions
In
December 2000, the EPA announced it would proceed with the development of
regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants from electric power plants,
identifying mercury as the hazardous air pollutant of greatest concern. In March
2005, the EPA finalized the CAMR, which provides a cap-and-trade program to
reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants in two phases; initially,
capping national mercury emissions at 38 tons by 2010 as a co-benefit from
implementation of SO2 and
NOX
emission caps under the EPA CAIR program and 15 tons per year by 2018.
Several states and environmental groups appealed the CAMR to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia. On February 8, 2008, the Court vacated the
CAMR, ruling that the EPA failed to take the necessary steps to de-list
coal-fired power plants from its hazardous air pollutant program and, therefore,
could not promulgate a cap-and-trade program. The EPA petitioned for rehearing
by the entire Court, which denied the petition in May 2008. In October 2008, the
EPA and an industry group petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review of the
Courts ruling vacating CAMR. On February 6, 2009, the EPA moved to dismiss its
petition for certiorari. On February 23, 2009, the Supreme Court dismissed the
EPAs petition and denied the industry groups petition. On October 21, 2009,
the EPA opened a 30-day comment period on a proposed consent decree that would
obligate the EPA to propose MACT regulations for mercury and other hazardous air
pollutants by March 16, 2011, and to finalize the regulations by November 16,
2011. FGCOs future cost of compliance with MACT regulations may be substantial
and will depend on the action taken by the EPA and on how any future regulations
are ultimately implemented.
235
Pennsylvania
has submitted a new mercury rule for EPA approval that does not provide a
cap-and-trade approach as in the CAMR, but rather follows a command-and-control
approach imposing emission limits on individual sources. On December 23, 2009,
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania ruling that Pennsylvanias mercury rule is unlawful, invalid and
unenforceable and enjoined the Commonwealth from continued implementation or
enforcement of that rule.
Climate
Change
In
December 1997, delegates to the United Nations' climate summit in Japan adopted
an agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, to address global warming by reducing, by
2012, the amount of man-made GHG, including CO2, emitted
by developed countries. The United States signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 but
it was never submitted for ratification by the United States Senate. The EPACT
established a Committee on Climate Change Technology to coordinate federal
climate change activities and promote the development and deployment of GHG
reducing technologies. President Obama has announced his Administrations New
Energy for America Plan that includes, among other provisions, ensuring that
10% of electricity used in the United States comes from renewable sources by
2012, increasing to 25% by 2025, and implementing an economy-wide cap-and-trade
program to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050.
There
are a number of initiatives to reduce GHG emissions under consideration at the
federal, state and international level. At the international level, the December
2009 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen did not reach a consensus on a
successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol, but did take note of the Copenhagen
Accord, a non-binding political agreement which recognized the scientific view
that the increase in global temperature should be below two degrees Celsius,
included a commitment by developed countries to provide funds, approaching $30
billion over the next three years with a goal of increasing to $100 billion by
2020, and established the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund to support mitigation,
adaptation, and other climate-related activities in developing countries. Once
they have become a party to the Copenhagen Accord, developed economies, such as
the European Union, Japan, Russia, and the United States, would commit to
quantified economy-wide emissions targets from 2020, while developing countries,
including Brazil, China, and India, would agree to take mitigation actions,
subject to their domestic measurement, reporting, and verification. At the
federal level, members of Congress have introduced several bills seeking to
reduce emissions of GHG in the United States, and the House of Representatives
passed one such bill, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, on
June 26, 2009. The Senate continues to consider a number of measures to regulate
GHG emissions. State activities, primarily the northeastern states participating
in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and western states, led by California,
have coordinated efforts to develop regional strategies to control emissions of
certain GHGs.
On April
2, 2007, the United States Supreme Court found that the EPA has the authority to
regulate CO2 emissions
from automobiles as air pollutants under the CAA. Although this decision did
not address CO2 emissions
from electric generating plants, the EPA has similar authority under the CAA to
regulate air pollutants from those and other facilities. In December 2009, the
EPA released its final Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for
Greenhouse Gases under the Clean Air Act. The EPAs finding concludes that the
atmospheric concentrations of several key GHG threaten the health and welfare of
future generations and that the combined emissions of these gases by motor
vehicles contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of these key GHG and hence
to the threat of climate change. Although the EPAs finding does not establish
emission requirements for motor vehicles, such requirements are expected to
occur through further rulemakings. Additionally, while the EPAs endangerment
findings do not specifically address stationary sources, including electric
generating plantsEPAs expected establishment of emission
requirements for motor vehicles would be expected to support the establishment
of future emission requirements by the EPA for stationary sources. In September
2009, the EPA finalized a national GHG emissions collection and reporting rule
that will require FirstEnergy to measure GHG emissions commencing in 2010 and
submit reports commencing in 2011. Also in September 2009, EPA proposed new
thresholds for GHG emissions that define when CAA permits under the NSR and
Title V operating permits programs would be required. EPA is proposing a major
source emissions applicability threshold of 25,000 tons per year tpy of carbon
dioxide equivalents CO2e for existing facilities under the Title V operating
permits program and the Prevention of Significant Determination PSD portion of
NSR. EPA is also proposing a significance level between 10,000 and 25,000 tpy
CO2e to determine if existing major sources making modifications that result in
an increase of emissions above the significance level would be required to
obtain a PSD permit.
On
September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and on
October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, reversed and
remanded lower court decisions that had dismissed complaints alleging damage
from GHG emissions on jurisdictional grounds. These cases involve common law
tort claims, including public and private nuisance, alleging that GHG emissions
contribute to global warming and result in property damages. While FirstEnergy
is not a party to either litigation, should the courts of appeals decisions be
affirmed or not subjected to further review, FirstEnergy and/or one or more of
its subsidiaries could be named in actions making similar
allegations.
FirstEnergy
cannot currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies,
although potential legislative or regulatory programs restricting CO2 emissions,
or litigation alleging damages from GHG emissions, could require significant
capital and other expenditures or result in changes to its operations. The
CO2
emissions per KWH of electricity generated by FirstEnergy is lower than many
regional competitors due to its diversified generation sources, which include
low or non-CO2 emitting
gas-fired and nuclear generators.
236
Clean
Water Act
Various
water quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of the federal
Clean Water Act and its amendments, apply to FirstEnergy plants. In addition,
Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have water quality standards applicable to
FirstEnergy operations. As provided in the Clean Water Act, authority to grant
federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System water discharge permits
can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have assumed such
authority.
On
September 7, 2004, the EPA established new performance standards under Section
316b of the Clean Water Act for reducing impacts on fish and shellfish from
cooling water intake structures at certain existing large electric generating
plants. The regulations call for reductions in impingement mortality when
aquatic organisms are pinned against screens or other parts of a cooling water
intake system and entrainment which occurs when aquatic life is drawn into a
facility cooling water system. On January 26, 2007, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit remanded portions of the rulemaking dealing
with impingement mortality and entrainment back to the EPA for further
rulemaking and eliminated the restoration option from the EPAs regulations. On
July 9, 2007, the EPA suspended this rule, noting that until further rulemaking
occurs, permitting authorities should continue the existing practice of applying
their best professional judgment to minimize impacts on fish and shellfish from
cooling water intake structures. On April 1, 2009, the Supreme Court of the
United States reversed one significant aspect of the Second Circuit Courts
opinion and decided that Section 316b of the Clean Water Act authorizes the
EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology available
for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake structures.
EPA is developing a new regulation under Section 316b of the Clean Water Act
consistent with the opinions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals which
have created significant uncertainty about the specific nature, scope and timing
of the final performance standard. FirstEnergy is studying various control
options and their costs and effectiveness. Depending on the results of such
studies and the EPAs further rulemaking and any action taken by the states
exercising best professional judgment, the future costs of compliance with these
standards may require material capital expenditures.
The U.S.
Attorney Office in Cleveland, Ohio has advised FGCO that it is considering
prosecution under the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for
three petroleum spills at the Edgewater, Lakeshore and Bay Shore plants which
occurred on November 1, 2005, January 26, 2007 and February 27, 2007. FGCO is
unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
Regulation
of Waste Disposal
As a
result of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, and
the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, federal and state hazardous waste
regulations have been promulgated. Certain fossil-fuel combustion waste
products, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste disposal
requirements pending the EPA evaluation of the need for future regulation. In
February 2009, the EPA requested comments from the states on options for
regulating coal combustion wastes, including regulation as non-hazardous waste
or regulation as a hazardous waste. In March and June 2009, the EPA requested
information from FGCOs Bruce Mansfield Plant regarding the management of coal
combustion wastes. In December 2009, EPA provided to FGCO the findings of its
review of the Bruce Mansfield Plants coal combustion waste management
practices.EPA observed that the waste management structures and the
Plant appeared to be well maintained and in good working order and recommended
only that FGCO seal and maintain all asphalt surfaces. On December 30, 2009,
in an advanced notice of public rulemaking, the EPA said that the large volumes
of coal combustion residuals produced by electric utilities pose significant
financial risk to the industry.Additional regulations of fossil-fuel
combustion waste products could have a significant impact on our management,
beneficial use, and disposal, of coal ash. FGCO future cost of compliance with
any coal combustion waste regulations which may be promulgated could be
substantial and would depend, in part, on the regulatory action taken by the EPA
and implementation by the states.
The
Utilities have been named as potentially responsible parties at waste disposal
sites, which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of hazardous
substances at historical sites and the liability involved are often
unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however, federal law provides that all
potentially responsible parties for a particular site may be liable on a joint
and several basis. Environmental liabilities that are considered probable have
been recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, based
on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, the Utilities' proportionate
responsibility for such costs and the financial ability of other unaffiliated
entities to pay. Total liabilities of approximately $101 million JCPL 74 million, TE - $1 million, CEI - $1 million, FGCO - $1 million and
FirstEnergy - $24 million have been accrued through December 31, 2009. Included
in the total are accrued liabilities of approximately $67 million for
environmental remediation of former manufactured gas plants and gas holder
facilities in New Jersey, which are being recovered by JCPL through a
non-bypassable SBC.
237
D
OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Power
Outages and Related Litigation
In July
1999, the Mid-Atlantic States experienced a severe heat wave, which resulted in
power outages throughout the service territories of many electric utilities,
including JCPL territory. Two class action lawsuits subsequently
consolidated into a single proceeding were filed in New Jersey Superior Court
in July 1999 against JCPL, GPU and other GPU companies, seeking
compensatory and punitive damages due to the outages.
After
various motions, rulings and appeals, the Plaintiffs' claims for consumer fraud,
common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, strict product liability, and
punitive damages were dismissed, leaving only the negligence and breach of
contract causes of actions. The class was decertified twice by the trial court,
and appealed both times by the Plaintiffs, with the results being that: 1 the
Appellate Division limited the class only to those customers directly impacted
by the outages of JCPL transformers in Red Bank, NJ, based on a common
incident involving the failure of the bushings of two large transformers in the
Red Bank substation which resulted in planned and unplanned outages in the area
during a 2-3 day period, and 2 in March 2007, the Appellate Division remanded
this matter back to the Trial Court to allow plaintiffs sufficient time to
establish a damage model or individual proof of damages. On March 31, 2009, the
trial court again granted JCPLs motion to decertify the class. On April
20, 2009, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to take an interlocutory
appeal to the trial court decision to decertify the class, which was granted
by the Appellate Division on June 15, 2009. Plaintiffs filed their appellate
brief on August 25, 2009, and JCPL filed an opposition brief on September
25, 2009. On or about October 13, 2009, Plaintiffs filed their reply brief in
further support of their appeal of the trial court decision decertifying the
class. The Appellate Division heard oral argument on January 5, 2010, before a
three-judge panel. JCPL is awaiting the Courts decision.
Nuclear
Plant Matters
In
August 2007, FENOC submitted an application to the NRC to renew the operating
licenses for the Beaver Valley Power Station Units 1 and 2 for an additional
20 years. On November 5, 2009, the NRC issued a renewed operating license for
Beaver Valley Power Station, Units 1 and 2. The operating licenses for these
facilities were extended until 2036 and 2047 for Units 1 and 2,
respectively.
Under
NRC regulations, FirstEnergy must ensure that adequate funds will be available
to decommission its nuclear facilities. As of December 31, 2009, FirstEnergy had
approximately $19 billion invested in external trusts to be used for the
decommissioning and environmental remediation of Davis-Besse, Beaver Valley,
Perry and TMI-2. As part of the application to the NRC to transfer the ownership
of Davis-Besse, Beaver Valley and Perry to NGC in 2005, FirstEnergy provided an
additional $80 million parental guarantee associated with the funding of
decommissioning costs for these units and indicated that it planned to
contribute an additional $80 million to these trusts by 2010. As required by the
NRC, FirstEnergy annually recalculates and adjusts the amount of its parental
guarantee, as appropriate. The values of FirstEnergys nuclear decommissioning
trusts fluctuate based on market conditions. If the value of the trusts decline
by a material amount, FirstEnergys obligation to fund the trusts may increase.
Disruptions in the capital markets and its effects on particular businesses and
the economy in general also affects the values of the nuclear decommissioning
trusts. On June 18, 2009, the NRC informed FENOC that its review tentatively
concluded that a shortfall existed in the decommissioning trust fund for Beaver
Valley Unit 1. On November 24, 2009, FENOC submitted a revised decommissioning
funding calculation using the NRC formula method based on the renewed license
for Beaver Valley Unit 1, which extended operations until 2036. FENOCs
submittal demonstrated that there was a de minimis shortfall. On December 11,
2009, the NRCs review of FirstEnergys methodology for the funding of
decommissioning of this facility concluded that there was reasonable assurance
of adequate decommissioning funding at the time permanent termination of
operations is expected. FirstEnergy continues to evaluate the status of its
funding obligations for the decommissioning of these nuclear
facilities.
Other
Legal Matters
There
are various lawsuits, claims including claims for asbestos exposure and
proceedings related to FirstEnergy normal business operations pending against
FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries. The other potentially material items not
otherwise discussed above are described below.
JCPL
bargaining unit employees filed a grievance challenging JCPL 2002
call-out procedure that required bargaining unit employees to respond to
emergency power outages. On May 20, 2004, an arbitration panel concluded that
the call-out procedure violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement. On
September 9, 2005, the arbitration panel issued an opinion to award
approximately $16 million to the bargaining unit employees. A final order
identifying the individual damage amounts was issued on October 31, 2007 and the
award appeal process was initiated. The union filed a motion with the federal
Court to confirm the award and JCPL filed its answer and counterclaim to
vacate the award on December 31, 2007. JCPL and the union filed briefs in
June and July of 2008 and oral arguments were held in the fall. On February 25,
2009, the federal district court denied JCPLs motion to vacate the
arbitration decision and granted the unions motion to confirm the award.
JCPL filed a Notice of Appeal to the Third Circuit and a Motion to Stay
Enforcement of the Judgment on March 6, 2009. The appeal process could take as
long as 24 months. The parties are participating in the federal court
mediation programs and have held private settlement discussions. JCPL
recognized a liability for the potential $16 million award in 2005.
Post-judgment interest began to accrue as of February 25, 2009, and the
liability will be adjusted accordingly.
238
FirstEnergy
accrues legal liabilities only when it concludes that it is probable that it has
an obligation for such costs and can reasonably estimate the amount of such
costs. If it were ultimately determined that FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries
have legal liability or are otherwise made subject to liability based on the
above matters, it could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy or its
subsidiaries' financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.
16.SEGMENT
INFORMATION
Financial
information for each of FirstEnergys reportable segments is presented in the
following table. FES and the Utilities do not have separate reportable operating
segments. With the completion of transition to a fully competitive generation
market in Ohio in 2009, the former Ohio Transitional Generation Services segment
was combined with the Energy Delivery Services segment, consistent with how
management views the business. Disclosures for FirstEnergys operating segments
for 2008 and 2007 have been reclassified to conform to the 2009
presentation.
The
energy delivery services segment transmits and distributes electricity through
our eight utility operating companies, serving 45 million customers within
36,100 square miles of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey and purchases power for
its PLR and default service requirements in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
Its revenues are primarily derived from the delivery of electricity within our
service areas, cost recovery of regulatory assets and the sale of electric
generation service to retail customers who have not selected an alternative
supplier default service in its Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey franchise
areas. Its results reflect the commodity costs of securing electric generation
from FES and from non-affiliated power suppliers, the net PJM and MISO
transmission expenses related to the delivery of the respective generation
loads, and the deferral and amortization of certain fuel costs.
The
competitive energy services segment supplies electric power to end-use customers
through retail and wholesale arrangements, including associated company power
sales to meet all or a portion of the PLR and default service requirements of
FirstEnergy Ohio and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries and competitive retail
sales to customers primarily in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Michigan. This
business segment owns or leases and operates 19 generating facilities with a net
demonstrated capacity of 13,710 MWs and also purchases electricity to meet sales
obligations. The segment net income is primarily derived from affiliated and
non-affiliated electric generation sales revenues less the related costs of
electricity generation, including purchased power and net transmission
including congestion and ancillary costs charged by PJM and MISO to deliver
energy to the segments customers.
239
The
other segment contains corporate items and other businesses that are below the
quantifiable threshold for separate disclosure as a reportable
segment.

Under
the accounting standard for the effects of certain types of regulation,
internal revenues are not fully offset for sales of RECs by FES to the
Ohio Companies that are retained in
inventory.
240
Reconciling
adjustments to segment operating results from internal management reporting to
consolidated external financial reporting primarily consist of interest expense
related to holding company debt, corporate support services revenues and
expenses and elimination of intersegment transactions.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND
INTERPRETATIONS
In 2009,
the FASB amended the derecognition guidance in the Transfers and Servicing Topic
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and eliminated the concept of a
QSPE. The amended guidance requires an evaluation of all existing QSPEs to
determine whether they must be consolidated. This standard is effective for
financial asset transfers that occur in fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2009. FirstEnergy does not expect this standard to have a material effect
upon its financial statements.
In 2009,
the FASB amended the consolidation guidance applied to VIEs. This standard
replaces the quantitative approach previously required to determine which entity
has a controlling financial interest in a VIE with a qualitative approach. Under
the new approach, the primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both
a the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact
the entitys economic performance, and b the obligation to absorb losses of
the entity, or the right to receive benefits from the entity, that could be
significant to the VIE. This standard also requires ongoing reassessments of
whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and enhanced disclosures
about an entitys involvement in VIEs. The standard is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2009. FirstEnergy is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements.
In 2010,
the FASB amended the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification to require additional disclosures about 1
transfers of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, including the reason
for transfers, 2 purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll
forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, 3 additional
disaggregation to include fair value measurement disclosures for each class of
assets and liabilities and 4 disclosure of inputs and valuation techniques used
to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value
measurements.The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales,
issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value
measurements, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2010.FirstEnergy does not expect this standard to have a material
effect upon its financial statements.

TRANSACTIONS
WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES
FES and
the Utilities operating revenues, operating expenses, investment income and
interest expense include transactions with affiliated companies. These
affiliated company transactions include PSAs between FES and the Utilities,
support service billings from FESC and FENOC, interest on associated company
notes and other transactions see Note 7.
The Ohio
Companies had a PSA with FES through December 31, 2009 to meet their PLR and
default service obligations. Met-Ed and Penelec have a partial requirement PSA
with FES to meet a portion of their PLR and default service obligations see
Note 9. FES is incurring interest expense through FGCO and NGC on associated
company notes payable to the Ohio Companies and Penn related to the 2005
intra-system generation asset transfers. The primary affiliated company
transactions for FES and the Utilities for the three years ended December 31,
2009 are as follows:

FirstEnergy does not
bill directly or allocate any of its costs to any subsidiary company. Costs are
allocated to FES and the Utilities from FESC and FENOC. The majority of costs
are directly billed or assigned at no more than cost. The remaining costs are
for services that are provided on behalf of more than one company, or costs that
cannot be precisely identified and are allocated using formulas developed by
FESC and FENOC. The current allocation or assignment formulas used and their
bases include multiple factor formulas: each company proportionate amount of
FirstEnergy aggregate direct payroll, number of employees, asset balances,
revenues, number of customers, other factors and specific departmental charge
ratios. Management believes that these allocation methods are reasonable.
Intercompany transactions with FirstEnergy and its other subsidiaries are
generally settled under commercial terms within thirty days.

SUPPLEMENTAL
GUARANTOR INFORMATION
As
discussed, in Note7, FES has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of
FGCO obligations under each of the leases associated with Bruce Mansfield Unit
1. The consolidating statements of income for the three years ended
December31, 2009, consolidating balance sheets as of December31,
2009, and December31, 2008, and condensed consolidating statements of cash
flows for the three years ended December31, 2009, for FES parent and
guarantor, FGCO and NGC non-guarantor are presented below. Investments in
wholly owned subsidiaries are accounted for by FES using the equity method.
Results of operations for FGCO and NGC are, therefore, reflected in FES
investment accounts and earnings as if operating lease treatment was achieved
see Note7. The principal elimination entries eliminate investments in
subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions and the entries required
to reflect operating lease treatment associated with the 2007 Bruce Mansfield
Unit1 sale and leaseback transaction.

SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS
On
February 11, 2010, FirstEnergy and Allegheny Energy, Inc. Allegheny announced
that both companies' boards of directors unanimously approved a definitive
agreement in which the companies would combine in a stock-for-stock
transaction.
Under
the terms of the agreement, Allegheny shareholders would receive 0667 of a
share of FirstEnergy common stock in exchange for each share of Allegheny they
own. Based on the closing stock prices for both companies on February 10, 2010,
Allegheny shareholders would receive a value of $2765 per share, or $47
billion in the aggregate. FirstEnergy would also assume approximately $38
billion of Allegheny net debt.
The
merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the approval of the shareholders
of both companies, as well as expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
and approval by the FERC, the Maryland Public Service Commission, the PPUC, the
Virginia State Corporation Commission and the West Virginia Public Service
Commission. The merger is also conditioned on effectiveness at the SEC of
FirstEnergys registration statement with respect to the shares to be issued in
the transaction. The companies anticipate that the necessary approvals may be
obtained within 12-14 months.
On
February 11, 2010, SP issued a report lowering FirstEnergys and its
subsidiaries credit ratings by one notch, while maintaining its stable outlook.
As a result, FirstEnergy may be required to post up to $48 million of collateral
see Note 15B. Moody and Fitch affirmed the ratings and stable outlook of
FirstEnergy and its subsidiaries on February 11, 2010. These rating agency
actions were taken in response to the announcement of the proposed merger with
Allegheny.
