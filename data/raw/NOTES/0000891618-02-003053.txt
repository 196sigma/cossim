Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data and the Risk Factors set forth in Item1.
Business. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our
Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. The preparation of these Consolidated
Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, our
estimates and judgments, including those related to sales
returns, bad debts, excess inventory and purchase commitments,
investments, intangible assets, lease losses and restructuring
accruals, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates
on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. We believe the accounting policies described
below, among others, are the ones that most frequently require
us to make estimates and judgments, and therefore are critical
to the understanding of our results of operations   
revenue recognition and allowances;
inventory write-down;
restructuring accruals and impairment losses on
investments;
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill; and
accounting for income taxes.
Revenue recognition and allowances We apply the provisions of Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition
as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, and related
interpretations to all revenue transactions. We recognize
revenue when Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists.
It is our customary practice to have a
purchase order prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement. Delivery Has Occurred.
Our product is physically delivered to
our customers, generally with standard transfer terms as FOB
shipping point. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred. The Fee Is Fixed or Determinable.
Arrangements with payment terms
extending beyond our standard terms and condition practices are
not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such
arrangements is recognized as the fees become due and payable. Collection Is Probable.
Probability of collection is assessed
on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are subjected to a
credit review process that evaluates the customers
financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If it is
determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is
not probable based upon our review process, revenue is
recognized upon cash receipt. For arrangements with multiple elements, we
allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based
on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items.
We defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair
value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered.
Vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged
when the element is sold separately. 21 Table of Contents A typical arrangement includes product, software
subscription, and maintenance. Some arrangements include
training and consulting. Software subscriptions include
unspecified products upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes, and patch releases, and
are included in product revenues. Service maintenance includes
contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance.
Revenue from software subscriptions and maintenance is
recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally one to
three years. Revenue from training and consulting is recognized
as the services are performed. We record reductions to revenue for estimated
sales returns at the time of shipment. These estimates are based
on historical sales returns, changes in customer demand, and
other factors. If actual future returns and allowances differ
from past experience, additional allowances may be required. We also maintain a separate allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. We analyze
accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer solvency, current economic and
geographic trends, and changes in customer payment terms and
practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of our customers
deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments, additional allowances may be required. Inventory write-down We write-down inventory and record purchase
commitment liabilities for estimated excess and obsolete
inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. Although we strive to ensure the
accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any
significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological
developments could have a significant impact on the value of our
inventory and commitments, and our reported results. If actual
market conditions are less favorable than those projected,
additional write-downs and other charges against earnings may be
required. We engage in extensive product quality programs
and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the
quality of our component suppliers. We also provide for the
estimated cost of known product failures based on known quality
issues when they arise. Should actual cost of product failure
differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated liability
would be required. Restructuring accruals and impairment losses
on investments In fiscal 2002, as a result of continuing
unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in IT spending
rates, we implemented two restructuring plans, which included
reductions in workforce and a consolidation of facilities. We performed a comprehensive analysis of our real
estate facility requirements and identified excess facility
space, which has subsequently been offered for sublease. Based
upon the results of this analysis, during fiscal 2002, we
recorded charges related to estimated facilities lease losses,
net of expected sublease income. In determining the net
facilities charge, various assumptions were made, including the
time period over which the facilities will be vacant, expected
sublease terms, and expected sublease rates. The charges
recorded were estimates in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No5,
Accounting for Contingencies, and represented the
low end of an estimated range that may be adjusted upon the
occurrence of future triggering events. Triggering events may
include, but are not limited to, changes in estimated time to
sublease the facilities, sublease terms, sublease rates, and
lease termination. Should operating lease rental rates decline
or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant
to sublease the facility, adjustments to the facilities lease
losses liabilities may be necessary in future periods based upon
the then-current actual events and circumstances. During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we purchased our Sunnyvale
headquarters site and terminated the operating leases. As a
result, an adjustment was made to reduce the previously recorded
estimated facilities lease losses by $15million. In fiscal 2002, we also recorded charges for a
reduction in workforce in response to a decline in customer
demand and macroeconomic conditions. See footnote 12
Restructuring Charges for further discussion. 22 Table of Contents These estimates are reviewed and revised
quarterly and may result in a substantial change to
restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than
were anticipated in original management estimates. Our investments in publicly held companies are
generally considered impaired when a decline in the fair value
of an investment as measured by quoted market prices is less
than its carrying value, and such a decline is not considered
temporary. Our investments in privately held companies are
considered impaired when a review of the investees
operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the
carrying value of the investment is not likely to be
recoverable. Such indicators include, but are not limited to,
limited capital resources, limited prospects of receiving
additional financing, and limited prospects for liquidity of the
related securities. During fiscal 2002, we recorded a noncash,
other-than-temporary write-down of $130million related to
impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private
companies. See footnote 2Short-Term Investments
and Investments in Nonpublic Companies for further
discussion. Valuation of intangible assets and
goodwill We periodically evaluate our intangible assets
and goodwill for indications of impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Intangible assets include goodwill,
purchased technology, and workforce. Factors we consider
important that could trigger an impairment review include
significant under-performance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results, significant changes in the
manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our
overall business, or significant negative industry or economic
trends. If these criteria indicate that the value of the
intangible asset may be impaired, an evaluation of the
recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its
remaining useful life is made. If this evaluation indicates that
the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows of the entity or technology
acquired over the remaining amortization period, the net
carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced
to fair value, and the remaining amortization period may be
adjusted. Any such impairment charge could be significant and
could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial
statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded. If an
impairment charge is recognized, the amortization related to
goodwill and other intangible assets would decrease during the
remainder of the fiscal year. No impairment losses were recorded
during fiscal 2002 based on these measurements. Accounting for income taxes The determination of our tax provision is subject
to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax
jurisdictions outside the United States. Sales to our
international customers are generally taxed at rates that are
lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a reduction of our effective
tax rate. The ability to maintain our current effective tax rate
is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the United States
and in the respective countries in which our international
subsidiaries are located. Future changes in domestic or
international tax laws could affect the continued realization of
the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to
receive from international sales. In addition, a decrease in the
percentage of our total revenue from international customers or
in the mix of international revenue among particular tax
jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate.
Also, our current effective tax rate assumes that U.S. income
taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of certain
non-U.S. subsidiaries. These earnings could become subject to
incremental foreign withholding or federal and state income
taxes should they be either deemed or actually remitted to the
U.S. The carrying value of our net deferred tax
assets, which is made up primarily of income tax deductions,
credits, and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from
stock option exercises, assumes that we will be able to generate
sufficient future income to fully utilize these tax deductions
and credits. If we do not generate sufficient future income, the
realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired
resulting in additional income tax expense. We have provided a
valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets
because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to
expectation of future employee stock option exercises. 23 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards On May1, 2001, we adopted SFAS 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. The adoption of this accounting standard did
not have a significant impact on our financial position, results
of operations, or cash flow. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued SFAS No141,
Business Combinations, and SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS
No141, all business combinations initiated after
June30, 2001 must be accounted for using the purchase
method. Under SFAS No142, goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed
annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of
impairment arise. Separable intangible assets that are not
deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized
over their useful lives but with no maximum life. The
amortization provisions of SFAS No142 apply to goodwill
and intangible assets acquired after June30, 2001. With
respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to
July1, 2001, we are required to adopt SFAS No142
effective May1, 2002. Upon adoption of SFAS No142,
we will stop the amortization of goodwill including acquired
existing workforce with a net carrying value of approximately
$498million at April30, 2002, and the annual
amortization of $152million that resulted from business
combinations initiated prior to the adoption. We will evaluate
goodwill under the SFAS No142 transitional impairment
test. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a
change in accounting principle on the date of adoption. We have
not determined whether adoption of SFAS No142 will have
an impact on our financial position, results of operations, and
cash flow. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, which addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets. SFAS No144 supersedes SFAS No121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Assets to Be Disposed Of. Adoption of SFAS No144 is
required for our fiscal year beginning May1, 2002. We are
currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of SFAS
No144 on our financial position and results of operations
and have not yet determined the impact of adopting this
statement. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001 Product
Revenues Product revenues
decreased by 238% to $7299million in fiscal 2002, from
$9578million in fiscal 2001. The decline in product
revenues was due to a decrease in product sales to
Internet-based companies and reduced capital spending among
technology companies across all geographies, but primarily in
North America. This decrease in product revenues for fiscal 2002
was specifically attributable to a lower volume of units and
software licenses shipped, as compared to fiscal 2001. Product revenues were negatively impacted by the
following factors   
reduced demand for our products resulting from
deteriorating macroeconomic conditions;
continued weakness in technology spending from
Internet- and technology-related customers;
decreased sales through indirect channels,
including sales through our OEM partners, representing 264% and
282% of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively;
declining average selling price of the F700
filers and older caching products; and
declining unit sales of our older products.
Product revenues were favorably impacted by the
following factors   
increased sales from new industry verticals:
energy, telecommunications, financial services, manufacturing,
life sciences and the government;
a higher average selling price of our new
products: our high-end F880 and low-end F87 filer products, as
well as new NetCache appliances and software features;
25 Table of Contents   
competitive pricing advantage as a result of
lower total cost of ownership in four aspects: lower acquisition
cost, reduced administrative overhead, minimized service cost
and reduced downtime of critical business applications;
data management and content delivery software
offering a unique set of features to ensure mission-critical
availability, while reducing the complexity of enterprise
storage management;
higher sales of software subscription upgrades,
representing 66% and 36% of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and
2001, respectively;
increased add-on software revenue from
multiprotocol solutions; and
introduction of NearStore appliances for business
continuance and online recovery.
Service
Revenues Service revenues
increased by 416% to $685million in fiscal 2002, from
$484million in fiscal 2001. Service revenue is generally
deferred and, in most cases, recognized ratably over the service
period obligations, which are typically one to three years. The
increase in service revenues representing 86 % and 48% of
total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively was
primarily related to a growing installed base resulting in new
customer support contracts in addition to support contract
renewals by existing customers. International total revenues including United
States exports decreased by 124% for fiscal 2002 as compared
to fiscal 2001. International total revenues were
$3352million, or 420% of total revenues for fiscal 2002.
The decline in international sales for fiscal 2002 was primarily
a result of a slower demand in the Europe and Asia Pacific
markets offset by our increased sales and marketing efforts
internationally. Product Gross
Margin Product gross
margin decreased to 641% of product revenues for fiscal 2002 as
compared to 643% in fiscal 2001. Product gross margin was negatively impacted by   
the decrease in product sales volume;
sales price reductions due to competitive pricing
pressure and selective pricing discounts;
lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory;
decreased licensing of our software due to lower
volume of units shipped;
lower average selling price of certain add-on
software options; and
higher disk content with an expanded storage
capacity for the higher-end filers including the F840 and F880
filers.
Product gross margin was favorably impacted by   
lower costs of key components and subsystems;
favorable product and software mix;
a faster-than-expected shift to our new
high-density storage subsystem due to a favorable average
selling price on the enclosures, electronics and power systems
sold with the disk systems, and efficient hardware packaging;
higher average selling prices for our new
products;
manufacturing overhead cost control and reduction
efforts, including the restructuring impact;
December and July partial facility shutdowns; and
growth in software subscription upgrades due
primarily to a larger installed base.
26 Table of Contents Service Gross
Margin Service gross
margin increased to 182% for fiscal 2002 as compared to a
negative gross margin of 238% in fiscal 2001. Investments in
customer service decreased by 65% to $560million in
fiscal 2002, from $599million in fiscal 2001. The
improvement in service gross margin in fiscal 2002 was primarily
due to operational and cost efficiencies in the global customer
service organizations. The negative service gross margin in
fiscal 2001 was due to the ramping up and continued investment
in our service infrastructure in anticipation of service revenue
growth. Sales and
Marketing Sales and
marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions,
advertising and promotional expenses, and certain customer
service and support costs. Sales and marketing expenses
decreased 16% to $2844million for fiscal 2002, from
$2890million for fiscal 2001. These expenses were 356%
and 287% of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001,
respectively. The decrease in absolute dollars was attributed to
various cost control and reduction measures, restructuring
impact, lower commission expenses and other profit-dependent
payroll-related expenses, and disposal of certain capital assets
in fiscal 2001, partially offset by the continued worldwide
investment in our sales and customer service organizations.
Sales and marketing headcount decreased to 1,224 in fiscal 2002,
from 1,277 in fiscal 2001 due primarily to the restructuring
impact. We expect to continue to selectively add sales capacity
in an effort to expand domestic and international markets,
introduce new products, establish and expand new distribution
channels, and increase product and company awareness. We expect
to increase our sales and marketing expenses commensurate with
future revenue growth. Research and
Development Research and
development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
prototype expenses, non-recurring engineering charges, and fees
paid to outside consultants. Research and development expenses
decreased 35% to $1167million in fiscal 2002, from
$1209million in fiscal 2001. These expenses represented
146% and 120% of total revenues for fiscal 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Research and development expenses decreased in
absolute dollars, primarily as a result of cost control,
reduction in discretionary spending efforts, restructuring
impact, the two holiday facility shutdowns, lower headcount, and
lower profit-dependent payroll related expenses, partially
offset by the operating impact of the Orca Systems, Inc.
Orca and WebManage Technologies, Inc.
WebManage acquisitions. Research and development
headcount decreased to 514 in fiscal 2002, from 566 in fiscal
2001. We expect to continuously support current and future
product development and enhancement efforts, and incur
prototyping expenses and non-recurring engineering charges
associated with the development of new products and technologies. We believe that our future performance will
depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our
current product line, develop new products that achieve market
acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness, and meet an
expanding range of customer requirements. We intend to
continuously expand our existing product offerings and introduce
new products, and expect that expenditures for these purposes
will increase in absolute dollars. For both fiscal 2002 and
2001, no software development costs were capitalized. General and
Administrative General and
administrative expenses decreased 01% to $402million in
fiscal 2002, from $402million in fiscal 2001. These
expenses represented 50% and 40% of total revenues for fiscal
2002 and 2001, respectively. Decreases in absolute dollars were
primarily due to cost controls, reductions in discretionary
spending, the impact of restructuring, the two holiday facility
shutdowns, and lower profit-dependent payroll related expenses,
partially offset by expenses associated with initiatives to
enhance enterprise-wide management information systems, general
legal costs, and an increase in the allowance for bad debts.
General and administrative headcount decreased to 246 in fiscal
2002, from 253 in fiscal 2001. We believe that our general and
administrative expenses will not increase significantly in
absolute dollars in fiscal 2003. Amortization of Intangible
Assets Amortization of
intangible assets represents the amortization on acquired
intangible assets and amortization on the excess of the
aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired by us. Intangible assets
as of April30, 2002, including goodwill, existing
workforce, and technology, were being amortized over estimated
useful lives of three to five years. We assess the
recoverability of intangible assets by determining whether the
amortized asset over its useful life may be recovered through
estimated useful cash flows. Amortization of intangible assets
charged to operations was $209 million and $117million
in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. 27 Table of Contents In-process Research and
Development We incurred
in-process research and development charges of approximately
$267million in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 related
to the acquisition of Orca. The purchase price of the
transaction was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities
based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the
acquisition. Approximately $267 million was allocated to
in-process research and development and charged to operations,
because the acquired technology had not reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative uses. The value was
determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired
in-process technology into commercially viable products,
estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects, and
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The
discount rate included a factor that took into account the
uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the
acquired in-process technology. These estimates are subject to
change, given the uncertainties of the development process, and
no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates
will not occur. Research and development costs to bring the
products from Orca to technological feasibility are not expected
to have a material impact on our future results of operations or
financial condition. The Orca acquisition has been successfully
utilized for the design and development of the DAFS protocol. By
eliminating much of the traditional operating system overhead,
DAFS allows for improved I/ O performance while using fewer CPU
cycles. The protocol leverages next generation networking
technologies that provide remote memory transfer capabilities,
including Remote Direct Memory Access RDMA
implemented in Virtual Interface VI and
Infiniband. The DAFS protocol has good industry support and is
now under consideration as an industry standard. We introduced
DAFS capable products in April 2002. Stock
Compensation We account
for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and comply with the provisions of SFAS
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, for non-employee compensation awards.
Accordingly, we recognize the intrinsic value for employees and
the fair value for non-employees as stock compensation expense
over the vesting terms of the awards. Stock compensation
expenses were $72million and $62million in fiscal
2002 and 2001, respectively. This increase was primarily
attributable to the recognition of stock compensation on options
assumed in the WebManage acquisition and the release of 165,310
contingently issuable milestone shares relating to Orca valued
at $30million. We expect an additional stock compensation
relating to 99,187 contingently issuable Orca common share, to
be measured on the date the performance criteria are met. Restructuring
Charges In August 2001, we
implemented a restructuring plan, which included a reduction in
workforce by approximately 200 employees and a consolidation of
facilities. The action was required to properly align and manage
the business commensurate with our then-current revenue levels.
All functional areas of the Company were affected by the
reduction. We completed our actions during the second quarter of
fiscal 2002. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred a
charge of $80million. The restructuring charge included
$48million of severance-related amounts 27million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $05million in fixed assets
write-offs. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we
purchased our Sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the
operating leases. As a result, an adjustment was made to reduce
the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by
$15million. As of April30, 2002, we had paid
substantially all of the severance liability. Of the balance at
April30, 2002, $05million was included in other
accrued liabilities. 28 Table of Contents The following analysis sets forth the significant

In April 2002, we announced and substantially
completed a restructuring related to the closure of an
engineering facility and consolidation of resources to the
Sunnyvale headquarters, which included a headcount reduction of
34 employees. As a result of this restructuring, we incurred a
charge of $59million. The restructuring charge included
$08million of severance-related amounts 46million of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $05million in fixed assets
write-offs. Of the reserve balance at April30, 2002 11million was included in other accrued liabilities and
the remaining $36million was classified as long-term
obligations. The following analysis sets forth the significant

We expect annual cost savings of approximately
$298million as a result of the restructuring and
reduction in force actions taken in the second and fourth
quarters of fiscal 2002. Interest Income and Other,
Net During fiscal 2002,
interest income and other, net was $166million, as
compared to $234million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in
interest income was primarily due to lower average interest
rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances
from cash, short-term investments and restricted cash generated
from operations. We expect interest income to decline further in
fiscal 2003, as existing investments mature and proceeds are
reinvested in a lower interest-rate environment. Interest income
and other, net also included gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions. Impairment Loss on
Investments We perform
periodic reviews of our investments for impairment. Our
investments in publicly held companies are generally considered
impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as
measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying
value, and such a decline is not considered temporary. Our
investments in privately held companies are considered impaired
when a review of the investees operations and other
indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the
investment is not likely to be recoverable. Such indicators
include, but are not limited to, limited capital resources,
limited prospects of receiving additional financing, and limited
prospects for liquidity of the related securities. In the second
quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded a noncash,
other-than-temporary write-down of $130million related to
impairments of our investments in publicly traded and private
companies. During fiscal 2002 and 2001, we sold shares of
certain marketable equity securities and the realized gains for
those periods were not material. Provision Benefit, for Income
Taxes For fiscal 2002, we
applied an annual benefit rate of 197% to pretax loss. For
fiscal 2001, our effective tax rate was 345%, which excluded
the effect of non-deductible amortization of goodwill and the
write-off of acquired in-process research and development. Our
estimate is based on existing tax laws and our current
projections of income/loss and distributions of income/loss
among different entities and tax jurisdictions, and is subject
to change, based primarily on varying levels of profitability. 29 Table of Contents Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000 Business
Combinations During the
first quarter of fiscal 2001, we acquired Orca for a purchase
price of $500million in common stock, assumed options and
cash, with an obligation to provide 264,497 shares of common
stock, which will result in additional stock compensation
charges if certain performance criteria are achieved. We also
paid certain transaction costs and assumed certain operating
assets and liabilities. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. The purchase price of the transaction was allocated to
the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated
fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Amounts allocated
to existing workforce and goodwill are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over three-and five-year periods,
respectively. Approximately $267million was allocated to
in-process research and development and charged to operations
because the acquired technology had not reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative uses. During the third quarter of fiscal 2001, we
acquired WebManage for $594 million in common stock, assumed
options and cash, with an obligation to provide shares of common
stock to be valued at $30million, if certain performance
criteria are achieved. The performance criteria were met in
March 2001 and the contingent consideration has been recorded as
stock compensation in the fourth quarter of 2001. We also paid
certain transaction costs and assumed certain operating assets
and liabilities. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. The purchase price of the transaction was allocated to
the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated
fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Amounts allocated
to existing technology and workforce are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over three years and amounts allocated to
goodwill are being amortized over five years. Product
Revenues Product revenues
increased by 719% to $9578million in fiscal 2001, from
$5574million in fiscal 2000. Product revenues growth was
across all geographies, products and markets. This increase in
product revenues for fiscal 2001 was primarily attributable to a
higher volume of units shipped, as compared to fiscal 2000. This
growth in volume declined in the second half of fiscal 2001.
Factors impacting unit growth include   
demand for our F700 filers utilizing primarily
fibre-channel disks;
introduction of our new higher capacity F840,
mid-range F820 and F85 entry-level filer products;
increased worldwide demand for our NetCache
appliances and content delivery network solutions;
increased worldwide shipment of NetApp Cluster
Failover solutions, which require another filer to take over in
the event of a hardware failure;
increased demand for the SnapMirror software
option, which requires multiple filers to provide remote
mirroring of data for quick disaster recovery and backup at
remote sites;
expansion of our sales organization to 976 in
fiscal 2001 from 582 in fiscal 2000; and
increased sales through indirect channels,
including sales through our OEM partners, representing 282% and
268% of total total revenues for fiscal 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
Product revenues growth was also positively
impacted by   
a higher average selling price of our add-on
software options;
SnapMirror, SnapRestore and SnapManager for
Microsoft Exchange, and Cluster Failover, supporting
mission-critical applications;
a higher average selling price of our new
high-end F840 filers;
a higher average selling price due to the
introduction of NetCache software features, including
ContentReporterTM and ContentDirector;
the increase in storage capacity;
increased add-on software revenue from
multiprotocol solutions; and
30 Table of Contents   
higher software subscription representing 36 %
and 29% of total revenues for fiscal 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
Overall product revenues growth was partially
offset by   
declining demand for our products in the second
half of fiscal 2001;
declining average selling price of the F700
filers and caching products due to competitive pricing; and
declining unit sales of our older products.
Service
Revenues Service revenues
increased by 1203% to $484million in fiscal 2001, from
$219million in fiscal 2000. The increase in service
revenues representing 48 % and 38% of total revenues for
fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively was primarily related to a
growing installed base needing maintenance and technical support. International total revenues including United
States exports grew by 1150% for fiscal 2001 as compared to
fiscal 2000. International total revenues were
$3825million, or 380% of total revenues for fiscal 2001.
The increase in international revenues for fiscal 2001, was
primarily a result of European and Asia Pacific total revenues
growth, due to increased headcount in the direct sales force,
increased indirect channel sales, increased shipments of filers,
Cluster Failover solutions and NetCache appliances and increased
sales of add-on software licenses, as compared to the
corresponding periods of the prior fiscal year. Product Gross
Margin Product gross
margin increased to 643% of product revenues for fiscal 2001,
from 628% for fiscal 2000. Product gross margin was favorably impacted by   
increased licensing of add-on software options
such as Multi-Protocol, Cluster Failover, SnapMirror,
SnapRestore, SnapManager and new software introductions
including ContentReporter and ContentDirector;
growth in software subscriptions due primarily to
a larger installed base;
lower costs of key components;
the increase in product volume;
increased manufacturing efficiencies; and
a mix shift to high-end F840 systems sold as
diskless upgrades, carrying higher margin than configured
systems.
Gross margin was negatively impacted by   
sales price reductions on storage products due to
competitive pricing pressure;
higher disk content with an expanded storage
capacity for the F840 filer;
lower sales volume in the second half of fiscal
2001; and
lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory.
Service Gross
MarginService gross
margin was negative 238% for fiscal 2001 as compared to
negative gross margin of 293% in fiscal 2000. Investments in
customer service increased by 1111% to $599million in
fiscal 2001, from $284million in fiscal 2000. The
negative service gross margin in both fiscal 2001 and 2000 was
due to the ramping up and continued investment in our service
infrastructure in anticipation of service revenues growth. Sales and
MarketingSales and
marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions,
advertising and promotional expenses, and certain customer
service and support costs. Sales and marketing expenses
increased 878% to $2890million for fiscal 2001 from
$1539million for fiscal2000. These expenses were
287% and 266% of total revenues for fiscal2001 and 2000,
respectively. The increase in absolute dollars 31 Table of Contents was primarily related to the continued worldwide
expansion of our sales and customer service organizations,
expansion of various marketing and industry initiatives,
increased commission expenses in the first three quarters and
disposal of certain capital assets in the fourth quarter. Sales
and marketing headcount increased to 1,277 in fiscal2001
from 775 in fiscal2000. Research and
DevelopmentResearch
and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and
benefits, prototype expenses, non-recurring engineering charges,
and fees paid to outside consultants. Research and development
expenses increased 964% to $1209million in
fiscal2001 from $616million in fiscal 2000. These
expenses represented 120% and 106% of total revenues, for
fiscal year 2001 and 2000, respectively. Research and
development expenses increased in absolute dollars, primarily as
a result of increased headcount, operating impact of Orca and
WebManage acquisitions, ongoing support of current and future
product development and enhancement efforts, prototyping
expenses and non-recurring engineering charges associated with
the development of new products and technologies, including the
NetAppF85, F800 series filers and the new generation of
our NetCache appliances coupled with our content distribution
and reporting software. Research and development headcount
increased to 566 in fiscal2001 from 327 in
fiscal2000. We believe that our future performance will
depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our
current product line, develop new products that achieve market
acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness and meet an
expanding range of customer requirements. For both
fiscal2001 and 2000, no software development costs were
capitalized. General and
AdministrativeGeneral
and administrative expenses increased 907% to
$402million in fiscal 2001, from $211million in
fiscal 2000. These expenses represented 40% and 36% of total
revenues, for fiscal2001 and 2000, respectively. Increases
in absolute dollars were primarily due to increased headcount,
expenses associated with initiatives to enhance enterprise-wide
management information systems and increased professional
service fees. General and administrative headcount increased to
253 in fiscal2001 from 162 in fiscal 2000. Amortization of Intangible
AssetsAmortization
of intangible assets represents the excess of the aggregate
purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired by us. Intangible assets
as of April30, 2001, including goodwill, existing
workforce and technology, are being amortized over the estimated
useful life of three to five-year periods. We assess the
recoverability of intangible assets by determining whether the
amortized asset over its useful life may be recovered through
estimated useful cash flows. Amortization of intangible assets
charged to operations was $117million and
$02million in fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. In-process Research and
DevelopmentWe
incurred in-process research and development charges of
approximately $267million in fiscal 2001 related to the
acquisition of Orca. The purchase price of the transaction was
allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their
estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
Approximately $267million was allocated to in-process
research and development and charged to operations, because the
acquired technology had not reached technological feasibility
and had no alternative uses. The value was determined by
estimating the costs to develop the acquired in-process
technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such projects, and discounting the
net cash flows back to their present value. The discount rate
included a factor that took into account the uncertainty
surrounding the successful development of the acquired
in-process technology. These estimates are subject to change,
given the uncertainties of the development process, and no
assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will
not occur. Research and development costs to bring the products
from Orca to technological feasibility are not expected to have
a material impact on our future results of operations or
financial condition. We believe we can utilize the Orca acquisition to
develop the first virtual interface-based VInext
generation of network storage systems. We are leveraging VI
architecture to develop the DAFS protocol. DAFS enables data
transfers straight from the file server, allowing clusters of
application servers in heterogeneous environments to share data
from the memory of one system to the memory of another without
involving general-purpose operating systems, thereby improving
CPU utilization and speeding up data access. We expect to
continue the development of products using this protocol and
believe that there is a reasonable 32 Table of Contents chance of successfully delivering initial
products in calendar year 2001. However, there is risk
associated with the completion of the in-process project and
there can be no assurance that such project will meet with
either technological or commercial success. Failure to
successfully develop and commercialize this in-process project
would result in the loss of the expected economic return
inherent in the fair value allocation. Additionally, the value
of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired. The
risks associated with the research and development are still
considered high and no assurance can be made that upcoming
products will meet market expectations or gain market acceptance. Stock
CompensationWe
account for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in
accordance with provisions of APB No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, for employee compensation
awards and comply with the provisions of SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, for
non-employee compensation awards. Accordingly, we recognize the
intrinsic value for employees and the fair value for
non-employees as stock compensation expense over the vesting
terms of the awards. Stock compensation expenses were
$62million and $13million in fiscal2001 and
2000, respectively. This increase was primarily attributable to
the recognition of stock compensation of unvested options
assumed in the WebManage acquisition, issuance of contingently
issuable milestone shares, increased participation in the
salaried stock option grant program by certain highly
compensated employees and non-employee stock options awards. Total Other Income,
netTotal other
income, net, was $234million and $90million in
fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in interest
income was primarily due to increased cash and short-term
investments generated from operations and net proceeds from
stock option exercises. Provision for Income
TaxesOur effective
tax was 345%, excluding the effect of non-deductible
amortization of goodwill and acquired in-process research and
development of $355million for fiscal 2001. The effective
tax rate for fiscal 2000 was 355%. The effective tax rates
differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to state
taxes, credits, tax exempt interest, goodwill amortization and
acquired in-process research and development. Liquidity and Capital Resources We derive our liquidity and capital resources
primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working
capital, which increased by $468million to
$4636million. As of April30, 2002, as compared to
the April30, 2001 balances, our cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term investments increased by $901million to
$4541million. We generated cash from operating activities
totaling $1439million and $2184million in fiscal
2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash provided by operating
activities in fiscal 2002 was principally related to net income
of $30million, decreases in accounts receivable, and
increases in other accrued liabilities, deferred revenue,
coupled with depreciation, impairment loss on investments,
amortization of intangibles and stock compensation, partially
offset by decreases in accounts payable, accrued compensation
and related benefits and increases in inventories. In addition to lower net income in fiscal 2002,
the primary factors that impacted the period-to-period change in
cash flows relating to operating activities included the
following   
lower accounts receivable balances due to lower
sales and more collections in fiscal 2002;
noncash acquisition-related charges, stock
compensation, impairment loss on investments, provision for
doubtful accounts, and depreciation included in net income;
increased accrued liabilities relating to the
restructuring; and
increase in deferred revenue related to service
and software subscription upgrades.
33 Table of Contents The above factors were partially offset by the
effects of   
decreased balances for accounts payable due to
lower levels of business activity in fiscal 2002;
decreased accrued compensation and related
benefits due to payouts of profit dependent personnel expenses
accrued in fiscal 2001 and paid in fiscal 2002, vacation taken
during the July and December 2001 holidays facility
shutdowns, and lower commission accrual as a result of lower
levels of sales;
increased inventory levels due to preparation for
ramping our new NearStore product; and
decreased income taxes payable, primarily
reflecting lower profitability in fiscal 2002.
We used $2842million and
$837million of cash in fiscal 2002 and 2001,
respectively, for capital expenditures. The fiscal 2002 increase
in property and equipment includes the purchase of the land and
buildings at our Sunnyvale headquarters site for
$2498million. Since we have curtailed capital
expenditures, purchases of fixed assets were only
$344million in fiscal 2002, compared to
$837million the same period a year ago. The decrease was
primarily attributed to the slowdown in hiring and various cost
control and cutting measures. We have used $1499million
and $143million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively,
for net purchases of short-term investments. In the first
quarter of fiscal 2001, we acquired Orca for a purchase price of
approximately $500million, including common stock,
contingently issuable common stock, assumed options, cash
payments of $20million and related transaction costs. In
the third quarter of 2001, we acquired WebManage for a purchase
price of approximately $594million, including common
stock, assumed options, cash payments of $50million and
related transaction costs. Investing activities in fiscal 2002
and 2001 also included new equity investments of
$11million and $70million, respectively. We received $2302million in fiscal 2002
and used $1132million in fiscal 2001 from financing
activities. The increase in fiscal 2002 was primarily from the
decrease in restricted cash see Commitments and
Contingencies Note4 to Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements partially offset by decreased
proceeds from the sale of common stock. The decrease in cash
provided by sales of common stock for fiscal 2002, compared to
the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, was primarily
due to lower stock option exercise proceeds as a result of the
decline in our stock price. Our capital and liquidity requirements depend on
numerous factors, including risks relating to fluctuating
operating results, continued growth in the network storage and
content delivery markets, customer and market acceptance of our
products, dependence on new products, rapid technological
change, dependence on qualified technical and sales personnel,
risk inherent in our international operations, competition,
reliance on a limited number of suppliers and contract
manufacturers, dependence on proprietary technology,
intellectual property rights, the value of our investments in
equity securities and real estate, and other factors. We believe
that our existing liquidity and capital resources are sufficient
to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual
obligations at April30, 2002, and the effect such
obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow

34 Table of Contents Item7a. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk related to
fluctuations in interest rates, market prices and foreign
currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial
instruments to manage these risks. We do not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All
financial instruments are used in accordance with board-approved
policies. Market Interest and Interest Income
Risk Interest and Investment
IncomeAs of
April30, 2002, we had short-term investments of
$2434million. Our investment portfolio primarily consists
of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the
date of purchase of greater than three months which are
classified as available-for-sale, and investment in marketable
equity securities in certain technology companies. These highly
liquid investments, consisting primarily of government and
corporate debt securities, are subject to interest rate and
interest income risk and will decrease in value if market
interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10percent increase
in market interest rates from levels at April30, 2002,
would cause the fair value of these short-term investments to
decline by approximately $05million. Because we have the
ability to hold these investments until maturity we would not
expect any significant decline in value of our investments
caused by market interest rate changes. Declines in interest
rates over time will, however, reduce our interest income. We do
not use derivative financial instruments in our investment
portfolio. Market Price Risk Equity Securities
We are also exposed to market price
risk on our equity security included in our short-term
investments. Such investment is in a publicly traded company in
the volatile high-technology industry sector. We do not attempt
to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on this security and,
as a result, the amount of income and cash flow that we
ultimately realize from this investment in future periods may
vary materially from the current unrealized amount. A 50%
adverse change in the equity price would result in an
approximate $03million decrease in the fair value of our
equity security as of April30, 2002. The hypothetical changes and assumptions
discussed above will be different from what actually occurs in
the future. Furthermore, such computations do not anticipate
actions that may be taken by management, should the hypothetical
market changes actually occur over time. As a result, the effect
on actual earnings in the future will differ from those
described above. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We hedge risks associated with foreign currency
transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates on earnings. We utilize forward
contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies. All hedge instruments are
marked to market through earnings every period. We believe that
these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to
foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these
contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying
assets and liabilities. All contracts have a maturity of less than one
year and we do not defer any gains and losses, as they are all
accounted for through earnings every period. The following table provides information about

36 Table of Contents Item8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Stockholders of Network Appliance, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Network Appliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries
the Company as of April30, 2002 and 2001,
and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
April30, 2002. Our audits also included the consolidated
financial statement schedule listed in Item14a2. These
financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements and the financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Network Appliance, Inc. and its
subsidiaries as of April30, 2002 and 2001, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended April30, 2002 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, the consolidated financial
statement schedule listed in Item14a2, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. s/DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP San Jose, California May10, 2002 37 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS In thousands, except per share

STATEMENTS Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data 1.The
Company Based in Sunnyvale, California, Network Appliance
was incorporated in California in April 1992, and reincorporated
in Delaware in November 2001. Network Appliance, Inc. is a
worldwide leader in enterprise network storage and data
management solutions. NetApp network storage solutions and
service offerings provide data-intensive enterprises with
consolidated storage, improved data center operations,
economical business continuance, and efficient remote data
access across the distributed enterprise. Network
Appliances success to date has been in delivering highly
cost-effective network storage solutions that reduce the
complexity associated with conventional storage solutions.
Network Appliance solutions are the data management and storage
foundation for leading enterprises, government agencies and
universities worldwide. 2.Significant
Accounting Policies Fiscal
Year We operate on a
52-week or 53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. For
presentation purposes we have indicated in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements that our fiscal year end is
April30. Fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 52-week fiscal
years. Basis of
Presentation The
consolidated financial statements include the company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts
from prior years have been reclassified to conform to
current-year presentation. These reclassifications did not
change previously reported total assets, liabilities,
stockholders equity or net income. Cash and Cash
Equivalents We consider
all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Short-Term
Investments Our short-term
investments consist primarily of securities with original
maturities ranging between three and twelve months. All of our
investments are classified as available-for-sale, which are
carried at fair market value, and unrealized gains or losses
recorded in cumulative other comprehensive loss, which is a
separate component of stockholders equity, net of taxes.
Any gains or losses on sales of investments are computed based
upon specific identification. For all periods presented,
realized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments were
not material. Management determines the appropriate
classification of debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting
date. Available-for-sale investments are reviewed for evidence
of reductions in market value that are other than temporary. We
perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment. Our
investments in publicly held companies are generally considered
impaired when a decline in the fair value of an investment as
measured by quoted market prices is less than its carrying value
and such a decline is not considered temporary. During fiscal
2002, we recorded a noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of
$3,641 related to an impairment of our investment in a publicly
traded company. No write-downs were recorded during fiscal 2001
and 2000. Approximately $193,747 of our investment
portfolio at April30, 2001 was invested in a certificate
of deposit and was restricted to collateralize our operating
leases and classified as noncurrent restricted cash. During
fiscal 2002, we discontinued our operating leases by purchasing
the land and buildings at our Sunnyvale headquarters site,
converting restricted investments to property and equipment on
the balance sheet. Investments in Nonpublic
Companies We have certain
investments in nonpublicly traded companies in which we have
less than 20% of the voting rights and in which we do not
exercise significant influence. As of April30, 2002 and
2001, $1,724 and $10,084 of these investments are included in
other long-term assets on the balance sheet and are carried at
cost. We perform periodic reviews of our investments for
impairment. Our investments in privately held companies are
considered impaired when a review of the investees
operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the
carrying value of the investment is not likely to be 42 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data recoverable. Such indicators include, but are not
limited to, limited capital resources, limited prospects of
receiving additional financing, and limited prospects for
liquidity of the related securities. During fiscal 2002, we
recorded a noncash, other-than-temporary write-down of $9,367
related to impairments of our investments in private companies.
No write-downs were recorded during fiscal 2001 and 2000. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out
basis or market. Property and
Equipment Property and
equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which generally range from three to five years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of
the lease. Building improvements are amortized over the
estimated lives of the assets, which generally range from ten to
forty years. Construction in progress will be amortized over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are
ready for their intended use. We review the carrying values of long-lived
assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net
book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected
future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. The
amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured as the difference
between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the
asset. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible
Assets Goodwill and
purchased intangible assets include goodwill and other
intangible assets such as existing workforce and existing
technology, which are carried at cost less accumulated
amortization. For business combinations consummated before
July1, 2001, goodwill and existing workforce were
amortized through April30, 2002, using the straight-line
method over an estimated useful life of three to five years.
Amortization of other purchased intangibles is computed using
the straight-line method over the expected useful life of three
to five years. We evaluate the impairment of goodwill and
purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. See Note 2 Recently Issued
Accounting Standards of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Revenue Recognition and
Allowance We apply the
provisions of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition
as amended by SOP98-4 and SOP98-9 and related
interpretations to all revenue transactions. We recognize
revenue when Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists.
It is our customary practice to have a
purchase order prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement. Delivery Has Occurred.
Our product is physically delivered to
our customers, generally with standard transfer terms as FOB
shipping point. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or
return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria
are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an
arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred. The Fee is Fixed or Determinable.
Arrangements with payment terms
extending beyond our standard terms and condition practices are
not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such
arrangements is recognized as the fees become due and payable. Collection is Probable.
Probability of collection is assessed
on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are subjected to a
credit review process that evaluates the customers
financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If it is
determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is
not probable based upon our review process, revenue is
recognized upon cash receipt. For arrangements with multiple elements, we
allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based
on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items.
We defer the portion of the arrangement 43 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered
elements until they are delivered. Vendor specific objective
evidence is based on the price charged when the element is sold
separately. A typical arrangement includes product, software
subscription, and maintenance. Some arrangements include
training and consulting. Software subscriptions include
unspecified products upgrades and enhancements on a
when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes and patch releases, and
are included in product revenues. Service maintenance includes
contracts for technical support and hardware maintenance.
Revenue from software subscriptions and maintenance is
recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally one to
three years. Revenue from training and consulting is recognized
as the services are performed. The following table presents the components of
revenues, stated as a percentage of total revenues

We record reductions to revenue for estimated
sales returns at the time of shipment. These estimates are based
on historical sales returns, changes in customer demand, and
other factors. If actual future returns and allowances differ
from past experience, additional allowances may be required. We also maintain a separate allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. We analyze
accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer solvency, current economic and
geographic trends, and changes in customer payment terms and
practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of our customers
deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments, additional allowances may be required. Advertising
Costs Advertising costs
are charged to operations when incurred. Advertising expenses
for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately $2,543, $5,258
and $2,594, respectively. Software Development
Costs The costs for the
development of new software products and substantial
enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
incurred until technological feasibility has been established,
at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in
accordance with SFAS No86, Accounting for the
Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise
Marketed. Because we believe our current process for
developing software is essentially completed concurrently with
the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs
upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been
capitalized for any of the periods presented. In accordance with
SOP98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the cost of
internally-developed software is capitalized and included in
property and equipment at the point at which the conceptual
formulation, design and testing of possible software project
alternatives have been completed and management authorizes and
commits to funding the project. Pilot projects and projects
where expected future economic benefits are less than probable
are not capitalized. Internally-developed software costs include
the cost of software tools and licenses used in the development
of our systems, as well as consulting costs. Completed projects
are transferred to property and equipment at cost and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, generally three years. 44 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign
Exchange Contracts For
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency,
gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign
currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded
within stockholders equity as part of cumulative other
comprehensive loss. For subsidiaries where the functional
currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses resulting from the
process of remeasuring foreign currency financial statements
into U.S. dollars are included in other income. In fiscal 2002, we determined that the functional
currency of one of our subsidiaries had changed from the Euro to
the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and
liabilities were translated at the current exchange rate in
effect as of the balance sheet date, nonmonetary assets and
liabilities were translated at historical rates, and total
revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates
in effect during the period. Transaction gains and losses are
included in other income expensein the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. We utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge
against the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations
on certain assets or liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. The gains or losses on these contracts are included
in income as the exchange rates change. Management believes that
these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to
foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these
contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying
assets and transactions being hedged. Derivative
Instruments On May1,
2001, we adopted SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. The adoption of this
accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. As a result of our significant international
operations, we are subject to risks associated with fluctuating
exchange rates. We use foreign currency forward contracts to
attempt to minimize the impact of exchange rate movements on our
balance sheet relating to certain foreign currency assets and
liabilities. Gains and losses on these undesignated derivatives
offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being
hedged, and the net amount is included in earnings. In fiscal
2002, net gains generated by hedged assets and liabilities
totaled $1,684, which were offset by losses on the related
derivative instruments of $3,485. In fiscal 2001, net losses
generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled $2,250, which
were offset by gains on the related derivative instruments of
$3,898. In fiscal 2000, net losses generated by hedged assets
and liabilities totaled $2,745, which were offset by gains on
the related derivative instruments of $1,102. We do not enter
into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
purposes. Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange
forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted
transactions, firm commitments or equity investments. Use of
Estimates The preparation
of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to establish
accounting policies which contain estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Concentration of Credit
Risk Financial instruments
which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments,
and accounts receivable. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments consist primarily of U.S. government agencies,
corporate bonds, U.S. commercial paper, municipal securities,
cash accounts held at various banks, and money market funds held
at several financial institutions. We sell our products
primarily to large organizations in different industries and
geographies. Credit risk is mitigated by our credit evaluation
process and limited payment terms. We do not require collateral
or other security to support accounts receivable. In addition,
we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. In
entering into forward foreign exchange contracts, we have
assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The 45 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data counterparties to these contracts are major
multinational commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses
as a result of counterparty defaults. Comprehensive
Income Comprehensive
income for the years ending April30, 2002, 2001, and 2000
has been disclosed within the consolidated statement of
stockholders equity and comprehensive income. Net Income per
Share Basic net income per
share is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per share is
computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that
were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common
shares consist of incremental common shares subject to
repurchase and common shares issuable upon exercise of stock
options. The following is a reconciliation of the
numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income

No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and all of its interpretations for employee
awards, and in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, for non-employee awards. Accordingly, we
recognize the intrinsic value for employees and the fair value
for non-employees as stock compensation expense over the vesting
terms of the awards. Recently Issued Accounting
Standards In June 2001,
the FASB issued SFAS No141, Business
Combinations, and SFAS No142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS No141, all
business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 must be
accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS
No142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for
impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment
arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have
indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful
lives but with no maximum life. The amortization provisions of
SFAS No142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets
acquired after June30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and
intangible assets acquired prior to July1, 2001, we are
required to adopt SFAS No142 effective May1, 2002.
Upon adoption of SFAS No142, we will stop the
amortization of goodwill including acquired existing workforce
with a net carrying value of approximately $49,779 at
April30, 2002 and the annual amortization of $15,177 that
resulted from business combinations initiated prior to the
adoption. We will evaluate goodwill under the SFAS No. 142
transitional impairment test. Any transitional impairment loss
will be recognized as a change in accounting principle on the
date of adoption. We have not determined whether adoption of
SFAS No142 will have an impact on our financial position,
results of operations, and cash flow. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, which addresses financial accounting

4.Commitments
and Contingencies In fiscal 2002 we terminated our operating lease
obligations for our Sunnyvale headquarters site by purchasing
the land and buildings for $2498million. As a result of
headcount reductions in fiscal 2002, we are not currently
utilizing certain existing spaces at our California headquarters
site. Additionally, we have also exited office spaces under
non-cancellable leases in other locations both in the United
States and Europe. If we are unable to successfully sublease our
vacated and unoccupied office spaces under operating leases, our
operating results may be adversely affected. See Note12
Restructuring Charges. We lease other sales offices and research and
development facilities throughout the United States and
internationally. These sales offices are also leased under
operating leases which expire through fiscal 2019. We are
responsible for certain maintenance costs, taxes, and insurance
under these leases. The aggregate annual minimum rent commitment
under our operating leases is included in the minimum annual
lease payments schedule below. Future minimum annual lease payments as of
April30, 2002, are as follows

Rent expense was $18,150, $18,090, and $7,779 for
the years ended April30, 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively. Rent expense under certain of our facility leases
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease. The difference between the amounts paid and the amounts
expensed is classified as long-term obligations in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We have entered into agreements and established
Network Appliance accounts with Deutsche Banc Alex.Brown whereby
we have the option to guarantee any defaults of certain margin
loans made to two corporate officers by the financial
institution on their Network Appliance stock. We have also
entered into an agreement and established a Network Appliance
account with Goldman, Sachs and Co. whereby we have the option
to guarantee any default of certain margin loan made to a third
corporate officer by the financial 49 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data institution on his Network Appliance stock. The
amount of the guarantee is limited to the excess, if any, of the
amount of such loans over the fair market value of the Network
Appliance stock securing the loans. As of April30, 2002,
there was no such amount. In May 2000, we entered into a split dollar
insurance arrangement with our CEO. Under the arrangement, we
will pay the annual premiums on several insurance policies on
the life of the survivor of our CEO and his wife, and our CEO
will reimburse us each year for a portion of those premiums
equal to the economic value of the term insurance coverage
provided him under the policies. For each of the 2001 and 2002
fiscal years, we paid an aggregate net annual premium on these
split dollar polices in the amount of $2,050. Under the
arrangement, we will be reimbursed for all premium payments made
on those policies, and it its intended that we will be
reimbursed not later than May 2005. Upon the death of both our
CEO and his wife or any earlier cash-out of the policies, we
will be entitled to a refund of all cumulative premiums paid on
these policies by us, and the balance will be paid to our CEO or
his designated beneficiaries. The arrangement is terminable by
us upon thirty30-days prior notice, and such termination
will trigger a refund of the net cumulative premiums paid by us
on the policies. From time to time, we have committed to purchase
various key components used in the manufacture of our products.
Our loss accrual for such commitments to these key component
vendors are based on our current forecasts of inventory usage.
We establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased
components for which we believe it is probable that they will
not be utilized in future operations. To the extent that such
forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated
accruals may change. We are subject to various legal proceedings and
claims which may arise in the normal course of business. We do
not believe that any current litigation or claims will have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or
financial condition. 5.Line of
Credit In July 1998, we negotiated a
$5,000unsecured revolving credit facility with a domestic
commercial bank. Under terms of the credit facility, which
expires in October 2002, we must maintain various financial
covenants. Any borrowings under this agreement bear interest at
either LIBOR plus 1% or at the lenders prime
lending rate, such rate determined at our discretion. There were
no amounts outstanding under this line of credit at
April30, 2002 or2001. We also have foreign exchange facilities used for
hedging arrangements with several banks that allow us to enter
into foreign exchange contracts of up to $135,000, of which
$44,397 was available at April30,2002. 6.Stockholders
Equity Stock
SplitsOn
December20, 1999 and March22, 2000, we effected
two-for-one stock splits of the outstanding shares of common
stock. All share and per share amounts in these consolidated
financial statements have been adjusted to give effect to the
stock splits. Preferred
StockOur Board of
Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000shares of
preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences,
privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those
shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Stock Option
PlansWe adopted the
1993 Stock Option/ Stock Issuance Plan the 1993
Plan in April1993. In September1995, we
adopted the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan the 1995
Plan. The 1995 Plan replaced the 1993 Plan, and provides
for the grant of options and the issuance of common stock under
terms substantially the same as those provided under the
1993Plan, except that the 1995Plan does not allow
for the 50 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data exercise of options prior to vesting.
Accordingly, all options and shares issued under the
1993Plan were incorporated into the 1995Plan upon
the effectiveness of our initial public offering. Under the 1995 Plan, the board of directors may
grant to employees, directors and consultants options to
purchase shares of our common stock. The exercise price for an
incentive stock option and a nonqualified stock option cannot be
less than 100% and 85%, respectively, of the fair market value
of our common stock as determined by the board of directors on
the date of grant. Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36months. Options expire as determined by the board of
directors, but not more than ten years after the date of grant. In April 1997, the board of directors adopted the
Special Nonofficer Stock Option Plan the Nonofficer
Plan which provides for the grant of options and the
issuance of common stock under terms substantially the same as
those provided under the 1995Plan, except that the
Nonofficer Plan allows only for the issuance of nonqualified
options to nonofficer employees. In August 1999, the board of directors adopted
the 1999 Stock Option Plan the 1999 Plan, which is
comprised of two separate equity incentive programs:
ithe Discretionary Option Grant Program under which
options may be granted to eligible individuals during the
service period at a fixed price per share and iithe
Automatic Option Grant Program under which nonemployee board
members will automatically receive special option grants at
designated intervals over their period of board service. The 1999 Plan will supplement the existing 1995
Plan and Nonofficer Plan and those plans will continue to remain
in full force and effect until all available shares have been
issued under each such plan. However, the Automatic Option Grant
Program previously in effect under the 1995 Plan terminated as
of October26, 1999, and all automatic option grants made
to nonemployee board members on or after that date will be made
under the 1999 Plan. Under the 1999 Plan, the board of directors may
grant to employees, directors and consultants and other
independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common
stock during their period of service with us. The exercise price
for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot
be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock
on the grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36months. Options will have a term of ten years after the
date of grant, subject to earlier termination upon the
occurrence of certain events. In fiscal2002, the 1999 plan
was amended to increase the share reserve by an additional
13,400 shares of common stock and effect certain changes to the
Automatic Option Grant Program in effect for the nonemployee
members of the board of directors. Options granted under the 1999 Plan are subject
to the cancellation/regrant program with the following
limitations: ionly options held by employees who are
neither executive officers nor members of the board can be
repriced; and iithe total number of repriced options
will not exceed ten percent of the total number of shares of
common stock authorized for issuance under the 1999 Plan. In fiscal 2001, we assumed various stock option
plans in connection with our Orca and WebManage acquisitions.
Pursuant to the provisions of the merger agreements, outstanding
shares were exchanged under certain exchange ratios in effect at
the time of merger. Options granted under these plans generally
vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting
commencement date and then ratably over the following
36months. Options expire as determined by the board of
directors, but not more than tenyears after the date of
grant. 51 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan Under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, employees are entitled
to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair market
value at certain specified dates. In fiscal 2002, the plan was
amended to increase the share reserve by an additional 3,000
shares of common stock and extend the term of the ESPP to the
last business day of May, 2011. Of the 11,200 shares authorized
to be 52 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

per-share data issued under this plan, 4,171 shares were
available for issuance at April30, 2002, and 1,094, 448,
and 1,473 shares were issued in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively, at a weighted average price of $1460, $2796, and
$387, respectively. Pro Forma
Information As discussed
in Note 2, we continue to account for our stock-based awards
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and its related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized in the financial
statements for employee stock arrangements with the exception of
$7,202, $6,223, and $1,345 in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively, which consists of the amortization of deferred
stock compensation related to the granting of nonqualified stock
options at exercise prices below market, the recognition of
stock compensation of unvested options assumed in the WebManage
acquisition, and the issue of contingently issuable milestone
shares. Our calculations are based on a multiple option
valuation approach, and forfeitures are recognized as they
occur. Pro forma information under SFAS 123 is as follows

The Black-Scholes option pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option pricing models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. We use projected volatility rates, which are based
upon historical volatility rates since initial public offering,
trended into future years. Because our employee stock options
have characteristics significantly different from those of
traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our
options. Deferred Stock
Compensation We recorded
$1,301, $14,127, and $1,845 of deferred compensation in fiscal
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, primarily related to the
recognition of stock compensation of unvested options assumed in
the WebManage acquisition, and the grant of stock options to
certain highly compensated employees. We reversed $5,381, $34,
and $40 of deferred compensation in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively due to employee terminations. The reversal in
fiscal 2002 primarily related to the forfeiture of unvested
options assumed in the WebManage acquisition as a result of
employee terminations. 53 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data Under terms of the 1995 Stock Option Plan, highly
compensated employees as defined by our management are eligible
to contribute between $15 and $75 in annual salary for the
rights to be granted nonqualified stock options. The discount
from fair market value, which is equal to the amount of salary
contributed, has been recorded as deferred compensation expense.
The deferred compensation expense is amortized ratably over a
one-year period. In fiscal 2001, under terms of the acquisition
agreement with WebManage, we issued an additional
101shares of common stock to former WebManage stockholders
upon meeting certain performance criteria. The fair market value
of the shares of $3,000 was measured on the date the performance
criteria were met and was recognized as stock compensation. In fiscal 2002, under terms of the acquisition
agreement with Orca, we released an additional 165 shares of
common stock to former Orca stockholders upon meeting certain
performance criteria. The fair market value of the shares of
$3,015 was measured on the date the performance criteria were
met and was recognized as stock compensation. In fiscal 2002, we issued an option grant of
100,000 shares of common stock under the 1999 Plan to a
nonemployee board member with an exercise price of $1572 per
share, the fair market value per share on the grant date, in
recognition for services performed outside of the normal
capacity of a board member. The option has a term of
10years measured from the grant date, subject to earlier
termination following his cessation of board service, and will
vest in a series of 48successive equal monthly
installments upon his completion of each month of board service
over the 48month period measured from the grant date. 7.Income

net deferred tax assets for fiscal 2002 and 2001 are $16,383 and
$10,043, respectively, and are included in other assets within
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of fiscal 2002, the federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $832,681 and $160,687, respectively. The federal
net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal
2011, and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin
to expire in fiscal 2006. As of 55 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data fiscal 2002, we had federal and state credit
carryforwards of approximately $34,406 and $31,602,
respectively, available to offset future taxable income. These
federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2013
and the state credits will begin to expire in fiscal2008. We have provided a valuation allowance on certain
of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding
their realizability due to expectation of future employee stock
option exercises. Deferred tax assets of approximately $367,613
and $330,860 at the end of fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively,
pertain to certain tax credits and net operating loss
carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock
options. If recognized, the tax benefit of these credits and
losses will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders
equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision. 8.Segment,
Geographic and Customer Information Under SFAS131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, we
operate in one reportable industry segment: the design,
manufacturing, marketing and technical support of
high-performance networked storage solutions. We market our
products in the United States and in foreign countries through
our sales personnel and our subsidiaries. The Chief Executive
Officer is our Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, as defined
by SFAS131. The CODM evaluates resource allocation
decisions and operational performance based upon revenue by
geographic regions of the segment. Under paragraph17 of
SFAS No131, we have one reportable segment as all the
geographic operating segments identified can be aggregated into
one reportable segment. For the years ended April30, 2002,
2001 and 2000, we recorded revenue from customers throughout the
United States and Canada; Europe; Latin America, Australia and
Asia Pacific. The following presents total revenues for the
years ended April30, 2002, 2001, and 2000 by geographic
area and long-lived assets as of April30, 2002 and 2001 by
geographic area.

primarily to the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, France, Israel,
the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada and Australia. No
single foreign country accounted for 10% or more of total
revenues in fiscal 2002, 2001, and2000. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total
revenues in fiscal 2002, 2001, or2000. 9.Fair Value of
Financial Instruments The following summary disclosures are made in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No107,
Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, which requires the disclosure of fair value
information about both on-and off-balance sheet financial
instruments where it is practicable to estimate the 56 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data value. Fair value is defined in SFAS107 as
the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a
forced or liquidation sale. Because SFAS107 excludes
certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments
from its disclosure requirements, any aggregation of the fair
value amounts presented would not represent the underlying value
of the Company. Amounts at April30 consist of

We do not use derivative financial instruments
for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into forward
foreign exchange contracts to hedge trade and intercompany
receivables and payables against future movement in foreign
exchange rates. All hedge contracts are marked to market through
earnings every period. The forward foreign exchange contracts require us
to exchange foreign currencies for U.S.dollars or vice
versa and generally mature in one month or less. As of
April30, 2002, we had $90,459 of outstanding foreign
exchange contracts in Australian Dollars, British Pounds, Swiss
Francs and European Currency Units, that had remaining
maturities of one month or less. As of April30, 2001, we
had $81,944 of outstanding foreign exchange contracts in British
Pounds, Swiss Francs and European Currency Units, that had
remaining maturities of one month or less. These foreign
exchange contracts are adjusted to the fair value at the end of
every month and are included in other income expense, net.
Gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are offset
by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities. At
April30, 2002 and 2001, the estimated fair values of
forward foreign exchange contracts were $90,603 and $82,385,
respectively. Unrealized gains or losses on foreign exchange
contracts were not significant at April30, 2002. The fair
value of foreign exchange contracts is based on prevailing
financial market information. Other than foreign exchange
contracts, we have not entered into any other material financial
derivative instruments. Approximately $193,747 of our investment
portfolio at April30, 2001 was invested in a certificate
of deposit and was restricted to collateralize our operating
leases and classified as non-current restricted cash. In fiscal
2002, the restricted investments were converted to property and
equipment on the balance sheet as we discontinued our operating
leases by purchasing the land and buildings at our Sunnyvale,
California headquarters site. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and restricted cash reported in the
consolidated balance sheets approximate their carrying value.
The fair value of short-term investments and foreign exchange
contracts is based on quoted market prices. Other investments in
equity securities comprise investments in companies in the
volatile high-technology market. 10.Employee
Benefit Plan We have established a 401k tax-deferred savings
plan Savings Plan. Employees meeting the
eligibility requirements, as defined, may contribute specified
percentages of their salaries. We contributed $1,235, $1,109,
and $611 for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. 57 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except
per-share data 11.Acquisitions In June 2000, we completed the acquisition of
Orca, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based developer of high
performance Virtual Interface VIArchitecture software
for enterprise-class UNIX and Windows systems. The acquisition
fits with our strategy of developing highly available and
reliable intelligent storage solutions that improve the
performance of todays Internet and enterprise applications
and strengthen our ability to develop next generation storage
networking architectures and protocols. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase. Under terms of the agreement, we
acquired Orca for $50,037 in common stock, assumed options and
cash, with an obligation to provide 264shares of common
stock, which will result in additional stock compensation
charges if certain performance criteria are achieved. Certain
performance criteria were met and as such, 165 shares of common
stock were issued and recorded during fiscal 2002. The fair
market value of such shares of $3,015 was measured on the date
the performance criteria were met and was recognized as stock
compensation. The remaining 99 shares of contingently issuable
common stock will be issued if certain performance criteria are
achieved. We also paid certain transaction costs and assumed
certain operating assets and liabilities. The purchase price of the transaction was
allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their
estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.
Approximately $26,688 was allocated to in-process research and
development and charged to operations because the acquired
technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative uses. The value was determined by estimating the
costs to develop the acquired in-process technology into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash
flows from such projects, and discounting the net cash flows
back to their present value. The discount rate included a factor
that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the
successful development of the acquired in-process technology.
These estimates are subject to change, given the uncertainties
of the development process, and no assurance can be given that
deviations from these estimates will not occur. Excluding the
charge that may result from 264contingently issuable
common shares, research and development costs to bring the
products from Orca to technological feasibility are not expected
to have a material impact on our future results of operations or
financial condition. Costs incurred prior to establishment of
technological feasibility are charged to research and
development expense and have not been material through
April30, 2002. The Orca acquisition has been successfully
utilized for the design and development of the DAFS protocol. By
eliminating much of the traditional operating system overhead,
DAFS allows for improved I/ O performance while using fewer CPU
cycles. The protocol leverages next generation networking
technologies that provide remote memory transfer capabilities,
including RDMA implemented in VI and Infiniband. The DAFS
protocol has good industry support and is now under
consideration as an industry standard. We introduced DAFS
capable product in April 2002. In November 2000, we completed the acquisition of
WebManage, a Chelmsford, Massachusetts-based software developer
of content management, distribution, and analysis solutions.
WebManage develops software that intelligently distributes
content between various points on the Internet and enables
organizations to plan, manage and deliver Internet/intranet
services. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Under
terms of the agreement, we acquired WebManage for $59,371 in
common stock, assumed options, and cash. We also had an
obligation to provide shares of common stock to be valued at
$3,000 if certain performance criteria were achieved. The
performance criteria were met in March 2001 and as such, the
contingent consideration has been recorded as stock compensation
in the fourth quarter of 2001. We also paid certain transaction
costs and assumed certain operating assets and liabilities. 58 Table of Contents NETWORK APPLIANCE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

In accordance with FASB interpretation
No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving
Stock Compensation, we recorded the intrinsic value,
measured as the difference between the grant price and fair
market value on the acquisition consummation date, of unvested
options assumed in the WebManage acquisition as deferred stock
compensation. Such deferred stock compensation, which aggregated
$12,304, is recorded as a separate component of
stockholders equity in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized over the
vesting term of the related options. The operating results of Orca and WebManage have
been included in the condensed consolidated statements of
operations since their acquisition dates. The following
unaudited pro forma consolidated amounts give effect to these
acquisitions as if they had occurred on April30, 1999 by
consolidating the results of operations of the acquired entities
with our results for the years ended April30, 2001 and
April30, 2000.

stock, and assumed options in connection with the acquisitions.
The $26,688 charge for purchased in-process research and
development has been excluded from the pro-forma results, as it
is a material nonrecurring charge. 12.Restructuring
Charges Fiscal 2002 Second Quarter
Restructuring Plan In August 2001, we implemented a restructuring
plan, which included a reduction in workforce by approximately
200 employees and a consolidation of facilities. The action was
required to properly align and manage the business commensurate
with our then current revenue levels. All functional areas of
the Company were affected by the reduction. We completed our
actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result of
this restructuring, we incurred a charge of $7,980. The
restructuring charge included $4,796 of severance-related
amounts, $2,656 of committed excess facilities and facility
closure expenses, and $528 in fixed assets write-offs. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we
purchased our Sunnyvale headquarters site and terminated the
operating leases. As a result, an adjustment was made to reduce
the previously recorded estimated facilities lease losses by
$1,509. The following analysis sets forth the significant
