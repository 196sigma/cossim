REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Board of Directors
MAXIMUS, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of MAXIMUS, Inc. as of
September 30, 1998 and 1999, and the related statements of income, changes in
redeemable common stock and shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September 30, 1999. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not
audit the financial statements of David M. Griffith & Associates, Ltd., a
wholly-owned subsidiary, which statements reflect total revenues of
$394 million for the year ended December 31, 1997. Those statements were
audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our
opinion, insofar as it relates to data included for David M. Griffith &
Associates, Ltd. is based solely on the report of the other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and, for 1997, the report of other
auditors, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
MAXIMUS, Inc. at September 30, 1998 and 1999, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
MAXIMUS, Inc. the Company provides a wide range of program management
and consulting services to federal, state and local government health and human
services agencies. The Company conducts its operations through two groups. The
Government Operations Group administers and manages government health and human
services programs, including welfare-to-work and job readiness, child support
enforcement, managed care enrollment and disability services. The Consulting
Group provides health and human services planning, information technology
consulting, strategic program evaluation, program improvement, communications
planning, and assistance to state and local governments in identifying and
collecting previously unclaimed federal welfare revenues.
The Company operates predominantly in the United States. Revenues from
foreign-based projects were less than 10% of total revenues for the years ended
September 30, 1997, 1998 and 1999.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following is a description of the Company more significant accounting
policies.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All material intercompany items have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes, in particular, estimates used in the earnings recognition
process. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR YEARS' FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company financial statements have been restated to reflect the
combination with David M. Griffith, Ltd. DMG in May 1998 and Control
Software, Inc. Control Software in February 1999 in transactions accounted
for using the pooling of interests method of accounting. See Note 3.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company generates revenue under various arrangements, generally
long-term contracts under which revenues are based on costs incurred plus a
negotiated fee, a fixed price or various performance-based criteria. Revenues
for cost-plus contracts are recorded as costs are incurred and include a pro
rata amount of the negotiated fee. Revenues on long-term fixed price and
performance-based contracts are recognized as costs are incurred. The timing of
billing to clients varies based on individual contracts and often differs from
the period of revenue recognition. These differences are included in costs and
estimated earnings in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs and
estimated earnings.

MAXIMUS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
REVENUE RECOGNITION CONTINUED
Management reviews the financial status of its contracts quarterly and
adjusts revenues to reflect current expectations on realization of costs and
estimated earnings in excess of billings. Provisions for estimated losses on
incomplete contracts are provided in full in the period in which such losses
become known. The Company has various fixed price and performance-based
contracts that may generate profit in excess of the Company expectations. The
Company recognizes additional revenue and profit in these situations after
management concludes that substantially all of the contractual risks have been
eliminated, which generally is at task or contract completion.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded
at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as
a separate component of shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and
declines in market value judged to be other than temporary are included in
investment income. Interest and dividends are included in investment income. For
the year ended September 30, 1999, unrealized losses on marketable securities
were $280. There were no material unrealized gains or losses on marketable
securities at September 30, 1998 and 1997. Marketable securities consist
primarily of short-term municipal and commercial bonds.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using both the
straight-line and accelerated methods based on estimated useful lives not to
exceed 395 years for the Company buildings and between three and ten years
for office furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the lesser of their useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using
enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences
reverse.
Prior to its initial public offering, the Company and its shareholders
elected to be treated as an S corporation under the Internal Revenue Code. Under
the provisions of the tax code, the Company shareholders included their pro
rata share of the Company income in their personal income tax returns.
Accordingly, the Company was not subject to federal and most state income taxes
during the periods prior to the initial public offering. The completion of the
Company initial public offering during June 1997 resulted in the termination
of the Company S corporation status for income tax purposes. In connection
therewith, the Company recorded a deferred tax charge against income of $2,566
for the cumulative differences between the financial reporting and income tax
basis of certain assets and liabilities at June 12, 1997.
The Company merged with two companies during 1998 and one company during
1999 that had elected to be treated as S corporations. The merger resulted in
the termination of the S corporation status for those companies and a deferred
tax charge against income of $325 in 1998 and $1,109 in 1999 for cumulative
differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company considers the recorded value of its financial assets and
liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable, to approximate the fair
value of the respective assets and liabilities at September 30, 1998 and 1999.
3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On March 16, 1998, the Company issued 840,000 shares of its common stock in
exchange for all of the common stock of Spectrum Consulting Group, Inc. and an
affiliated company Spectrum. This merger was accounted for as an immaterial
pooling of interests and accordingly, the Company financial statements,
including earnings per share, were not restated for periods prior to January 1,
1998.
On May 12, 1998, the Company issued 1,166,179 shares of its common stock in
exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of DMG. This merger was
accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly, the Company financial
statements, including earnings per share, have been restated for all periods
presented to include the financial position and results of operations of DMG.
DMG operations for the year ended December 31, 1997 were combined with the
Company operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1997. This resulted
in inclusion of DMG operating results for the three months ended December 31,
1997 in the Company operating results for both fiscal 1997 and 1998. DMG
revenues and net income for the three months ended December 31, 1997 were
$11,450 and $156, respectively.
On August 31, 1998, the Company issued 1,137,420 shares of its common stock
in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of Carrera Consulting Group
Carrera. This merger was accounted for as an immaterial pooling of interests
and accordingly, the Company financial statements, including earnings per
share, were not restated for periods prior to July 1, 1998.
On August 31, 1998, the Company issued 254,545 shares of its common stock in
exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of Phoenix Planning &
Evaluation, Ltd. Phoenix. This merger was accounted for as an immaterial
pooling of interests and accordingly, the Company financial statements,
including earnings per share, were not restated for periods prior to July 1,
1998.
On February 26, 1999, the Company issued 700,210 shares of its common stock
in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of Control Software. This
merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly, the
Company financial statements, including earnings per share, have been restated
for all periods presented to include the financial position and results of
operations of Control Software. Control Software operations for the years
ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 were combined with the Company operations for
the fiscal years ended September 30, 1997 and 1998. This resulted in inclusion
of Control Software operating results for the three months ended December 31,
1998 in the Company operating results for both fiscal 1998 and 1999. Control
Software revenues and net income for the three months ended December 31, 1998
were $2,170 and $114, respectively.

Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over periods
ranging from two to fifteen years. The accumulated amortization related to
intangible assets at September 30, 1998 and 1999 was $0 and $260.

billing rates on cost-based contracts.
6. CREDIT FACILITIES
The Company had a $10 million revolving line of credit with a bank. The
Company had never borrowed under the line and management allowed the line to
expire on March 31, 1999.
Certain companies that merged into the Company during 1998 and 1999 had
various arrangements for short and long-term borrowings. These credit
arrangements generally were repaid following the related merger and do not
significantly affect the Company financial statements.
7. LEASES
The Company leases office space under various operating leases, the majority
of which contain clauses permitting cancellation upon certain conditions. The
terms of these leases provide for certain minimum

charged to operations for the plan were $897 and $394, respectively.
Prior to its merger with the Company, DMG had deferred compensation
arrangements with certain officers and employees and had granted stock

S CORPORATION DISTRIBUTIONS
During fiscal year 1997, the Company made cash distributions to its S
corporation shareholders prior to the IPO totaling $1,212. In connection with
the IPO, the Company made an additional distribution of $20,500 to its S
corporation shareholders and accrued an additional distribution at
September 30, 1997 in the amount of $5,748, such aggregate amount representing
the undistributed earnings of the Company taxed or taxable to shareholders
through the date of the IPO.
Consistent with their past practices, Spectrum, Phoenix, and Control
Software paid S corporation distributions totaling $1,917 during 1998, and
Control Software paid S corporation distributions totaling $756 during 1999,
based upon pre-merger taxable income.
REDEEMABLE COMMON STOCK
Prior to the IPO, a shareholders' agreement obligated the Company to
purchase all shares offered for sale by the Company shareholders at a formula
price based on the book value of the Company. In addition, shareholders were
obligated to sell and the Company was obligated to purchase at the formula price
all of the shares owned by the shareholders upon the shareholder death,
disability or termination of employment. DMG had agreements with certain of its
shareholders to repurchase its shares under certain circumstances at fair value.
The Company obligation to purchase common shares from shareholders terminated
upon completion of the IPO. Accordingly, amounts classified previously as
redeemable common stock, including amounts related to DMG, were reclassified
into shareholder equity.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
During fiscal 1998, the Company implemented a plan which permits employees
to purchase shares of the Company common stock each quarter at 85% of the
market value on the last day of the quarter. The initial sale of shares under
the plan occurred during fiscal 1998.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company Board of Directors established stock option plans during 1997
pursuant to which the Company may grant incentive and non-qualified stock
options to officers, employees and directors of the Company. Such plans also
provide for stock awards and direct purchases of the Company common stock.
The vesting period and share price for awards are determined by the
Company Board of Directors at the date of grant. Options granted during 1997
include those which were fully vested on issuance and others which vest over
periods from two to four years. The Company Board of Directors has reserved
31 million shares of common stock for issuance under the Company stock option
plans. At September 30, 1999, 13 million shares remained available for grants
under the Company option plans.
In January 1997, the Company issued options to various employees to purchase
403,975 shares of the Company common stock at a formula price based on book
value. During 1997, the Company recorded a non-recurring charge against income
of $5,874 for the difference between the IPO price and the formula price for all
options outstanding. The Company recorded a deferred tax benefit relating to the
charge in the amount of $2,055.
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 123, Accounting and Disclosure for
Stock-Based Compensation, which provides for
43
MAXIMUS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
10. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY CONTINUED
STOCK OPTION PLANS CONTINUED
a fair value based methodology of accounting for all stock option plans.
Under SFAS 123, companies may account for stock options under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
25 and related Interpretations and provide pro forma disclosure of net income,
as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in SFAS 123 had been
applied. The Company has elected to follow APB 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock options and provide pro forma fair value
disclosure under SFAS 123.
Pro forma information regarding net income has been determined as if the
Company had accounted for its stock options under the fair value method of
SFAS 123. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant
using a minimal valuation method in 1997 and the Black-Scholes method in 1998
and 1999 with the following assumptions: volatility 42% for 1998 and 56% for
1999; risk free interest rate of 65% for 1997, 55% for 1998 and 65% for 1999;
dividend yield 0%; and an expected life of the option of 4 years. The grant-date
fair value of options granted was $358 for 1997, $961 for 1998 and $1445 for
1999.
For purposes of the pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to reflect such expense over the options' vesting period.
The effects of applying FAS 123 for providing proforma disclosures are not
likely to be representative of the effects on reported net income for future
years. For the years ended September 30, 1997, 1998 and 1999 pro forma net
income and pro forma net income per share resulting from the adjustment for
stock option compensation was as follows                            YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LITIGATION
On February 3, 1997, the Company was named as a third-party defendant by
Network Six, Inc. Network Six in a legal action brought by the State of
Hawaii against Network Six. Network Six alleged that the Company was liable to
Network Six on various grounds. In October 1999, the Company paid Network Six
$50 in full settlement of all claims. The settlement was made without admission
of fault or liability on the part of the Company.
On November 28, 1997, an individual who is a former officer, director and
shareholder of the Company, filed a complaint in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that at the time he resigned
from the Company in 1996, thereby triggering the repurchase of his shares, the
45

Company and certain of its officers and directors had failed to disclose
material information to him relating to the potential value of the shares. He
further alleges that the Company and its officers and directors violated
Sections 10b and 20a of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and breached
various fiduciary duties owed to him and claims damages in excess of $10,000.
The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend the
matter vigorously. Although there is no assurance of a favorable outcome, the
Company does not believe that this action will have a material adverse effect on
the Company financial condition or results of operations, and has not accrued
for any loss related to this action.
In January 1997, a lawsuit was filed against a number of defendants,
including DMG, by a purchaser of municipal bonds. DMG had prepared two reports
rendering an opinion on the anticipated debt service coverage of the revenue
bonds for the first five years of operation of a sewer project by Superstition
Mountain Community Facilities District No. 1 the District. The District was
unable to meet its debt service obligations and filed bankruptcy. The purchaser
of the revenue bonds, Allstate Insurance Company, has sued a number of
defendants, including DMG, for damages of $32,100 which is the face value of the
revenue bonds, plus interest. The District has also filed a lawsuit against DMG
seeking damages, which suit has been consolidated with the purchaser actions.
DMG-MAXIMUS believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend
against these claims vigorously. Although there is no assurance of a favorable
outcome, the Company does not believe that this action will have a material
adverse effect on the Company financial condition or results of operations and
has not accrued for any loss related to these claims.
The Company also is involved in various other legal proceedings in the
ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, these proceedings
involve amounts that would not have a material effect on the financial position
or results of operations of the Company if such proceedings were disposed of
unfavorably.
DCAA AUDITS
A substantial portion of payments to the Company from United States
Government agencies is subject to adjustments upon audit by the Defense Contract
Audit Agency. Audits through 1993 have been completed with no material
adjustments. In the opinion of management, the audits of subsequent years are
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
The Company has employment agreements with 25 of its executives and other
employees that provide for aggregate base salaries of approximately
$58 million per year. The terms of the employment obligations end between 2000
and 2003.
12. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable and costs
and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. To date,
these financial instruments have been derived from contract revenues earned
primarily from federal, state and local government agencies located in the
United States.

At September 30, 1998, $1,004 of the Company accounts receivable were due
from the United States Government. Revenues under contracts with various
agencies of the United States Government were $35,802 and $3,738 for the years
ended September 30, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Of these amounts, $31,611 and
$0 for the years ended September 30, 1997 and 1998, respectively, were revenues
of the Government Operations segment. A minimal amount of the Company accounts
receivable were due from the United States Government at September 30, 1999 and
a minimal amount of revenue was derived from the United States Government during
the year ended September 30, 1999.
As a result of legislation that eliminated certain Social Security
Administration program benefits, a contract with the United States Government
that contributed substantially all of the revenues of the government operations
segment for 1997 was terminated by the United States Government. This contract
concluded during the second quarter of 1997.
At September 30, 1998 and 1999, $9,706 and $12,640 of the Company accounts
receivable were due from one state government. Revenues from contracts with this
state, principally by the government operations segment, were $26,189, $30,934
