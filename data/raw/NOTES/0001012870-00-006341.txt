The Board of Directors
Keynote Systems, Inc.   We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Keynote Systems,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as listed in the accompanying index. In
connection with our audits of the financial statements, we also have audited
the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Keynote
Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 30, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1 The Company
Keynote Systems, Inc. was incorporated on June 15, 1995 in California and
reincorporated in Delaware on March 31, 2000. Keynote Systems, Inc. and its
subsidiaries the Company provide Internet performance measurement,
diagnostic and consulting services to companies that operate e-business web
sites.
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. The accounts
of the Company are included in the consolidated financial statements.
Significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
A Revenue Recognition
Subscription services revenue consists of fees from subscriptions to the
Company Internet measurement and diagnostic services. The Company
subscription revenues are deferred upon invoicing and are recognized ratably
over the service period, generally ranging from one to twelve months. Deferred
revenue is comprised entirely of deferred subscription revenue. A portion of
subscription revenues is invoiced monthly upon completion of measurement
services. We do not generally grant refunds during our three-month initial
subscription term. All discounts granted during the initial term are netted
against revenue. No revenue is recognized during the free trial periods.
Revenue from consulting services is recognized as the services are performed,
typically a period of one month. All of the revenue related to the Company
recently acquired load-testing services is also included in consulting revenue.
For consulting projects that span multiple months, the Company recognizes
revenue on a percentage of completion basis.
In March 2000, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF No. 00-3, Application
of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, to
Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entity
Hardware. Adoption of this EITF did not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.
Cost of subscription revenues consists of connection fees to Internet
service providers for bandwidth usage of the Company computer measurement
agents around the world, depreciation, maintenance and other equipment charges
for the Company measurement infrastructure. Cost of consulting services
consists of compensation for consulting personnel and related costs, and all
load-testing bandwidth costs and related infrastructure costs. Operations
expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for management
personnel, and technical support employees who manage and maintain the
Company measurement data and headquarter infrastructure and support the
Company customer base.
B Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
C Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all cash and highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
is exposed to credit risk in the event of default of the financial institutions
to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
41           Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued D Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three
years. Equipment under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the
useful life of the equipment or the lease term. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
lease term.
E Comprehensive Loss
The Company has no components of other comprehensive loss for any period
presented.
F Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk
The carrying value of the Company financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash and equipment notes
payable approximates fair market value. Cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable approximate fair market value due to their short-term nature.
Equipment notes and approximate fair market value as interest rates on these
notes approximate market rates. Financial instruments that subject the Company
to concentrations of credit risk consists primarily of cash and cash
equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
Credit risk is concentrated in North America. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and, generally,
requires no collateral from its customers. The Company has had immaterial
write-offs of accounts receivable to date. Based on its ongoing credit
evaluations, the Company has adequately reserved for doubtful accounts as of
the date of each balance sheet presented herein.
G Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The excess of the purchase price of companies acquired over the fair value
of the net assets acquired is classified as goodwill. Goodwill and other
intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over a
three-year period.
H Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock option grants under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
which permits the use of the intrinsic-value method in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and related interpretations. Expense associated with stock-based
compensation is being amortized ratably over the vesting period of the
individual award.
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation FIN 44, an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. The application of this interpretation is effective
July 1, 2000. Adoption of this FIN did not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.
I Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit
42           Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is
established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts the
Company expects to realize.
J Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, including goodwill and other
intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the
carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated
by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
K Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred until technological
feasibility has been established. To date, the Company service offerings have
been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of
technological feasibility and, accordingly, no development costs have been
capitalized.
In March 2000, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a
consensus on EITF No. 00-2, Accounting for the Costs of Developing a Web Site.
EITF No. 00-2 provides guidance on accounting for web site development costs
and is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after June 30, 2000. Adoption of
this EITF did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.
L Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
The Company classifies its investments in debt and equity securities as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market
value. As of September 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company had no investments in
debt or equity securities.
M Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of
outstanding shares of common stock excluding shares of restricted stock subject
to repurchase summarized below. Diluted net loss per share is computed using
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and, when
dilutive, potential common shares from options and warrants to purchase common
stock using the treasury stock method and from convertible securities using the
as-if-converted basis.
The following potential common shares have been excluded from the
computation of diluted net loss per share because the effect would have been
antidilutive in thousands                                  Year Ended

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued   The weighted-average exercise price of outstanding stock options was
$3335, $616, and $021 for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The weighted-average purchase price of restricted stock was
$025, $025, and $016, for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The weighted-average exercise price of the convertible preferred
stock warrants was $126 for the year ended September 30, 1998. The weighted-
average exercise price of common stock warrants was $005 for fiscal 1999 and
fiscal 1998.
N Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, as amended by SAB 101A and SAB 101B, which provides guidance on the
recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements
filed with the SEC. SAB 101 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to
recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue
recognition policies. In June 2000, the SEC issued SAB 101B, which delays the
implementation of SAB 101. The Company must adopt SAB 101 no later than the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001. The Company does not believe that the
impact of this staff accounting bulletin will have a material effect on the
financial position or results of operations upon its adoption.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, and in July 1999 issued Financial Accounting
Standard No. 137, Accounting For Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, an
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 SFAS 137. SFAS 137 delayed the effective
date for SFAS 133 by one year. SFAS No. 133 was further amended by Financial
Accounting Standard No138, Accounting for certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities SFAS 138 which was issued in June 2000. The
Company adopted SFAS 133 on October 1, 2000. Adoption of this statement did not
have a material effect financial position or results of operations.
O Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
fiscal 1999 and 1998 have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2000
financial presentation.
3 Stockholder Notes Receivable and Loans to Related Parties
In April 1998, the Company issued a stockholder note to an officer for

7 Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
In fiscal 1999, the Company raised $148 million by selling 6,734,545
shares of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock. The issuance costs
associated with issuing Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock were
approximately $82,000. In September 1999, the Company completed its initial
public offering of common stock. Upon completion of the Company initial
public offering, each share of Series A preferred stock, Series B preferred
stock, and Series D preferred stock was converted into 050 shares of common
stock and each share of Series C preferred stock was converted into 053 shares
of common stock.
8 Stockholders' Equity Deficit
A 1999 Equity Incentive Plan
In September 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan
Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan provides for the award of incentive stock
options, nonqualified stock options restricted stock awards and stock bonuses.
Options may be exercisable only as they vest or may be immediately exercisable
with the shares issued subject to the Company right of repurchase that lapses
as the shares vest. In general, options will vest over a four-year period. As
of September 30, 2000, the Company was authorized to issue up to 78 million
shares of common stock in connection with its 1999 Equity Incentive Plan the
Plan to employees, directors, and consultants, which includes options reserved
for issuance under the Company 1996 and 1997 stock option plans, which plans
terminated upon the completion of the Company initial public offering. The
number of shares reserved under the Incentive Plan will increase automatically
on January 1 of each calendar year by a number of shares equal to 5% of the
Company outstanding shares on the preceding December 31.
Stock options granted prior to April 1999 were generally immediately
exercisable subject to a restricted stock purchase agreement whereby the
Company has the right to repurchase the unvested portion of the shares upon the
voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser employment with the
Company at the original issuance cost. The Company right of repurchase lapses
with respect to 25% of the shares after one year and ratably on a monthly basis
over the following three years. Through September 30, 2000, 282,000 shares of
common stock issued upon exercise of stock options are subject to repurchase at
a weighted-average price of $025 per share. Certain of these restricted shares
were issued to officers and employees of the Company for full recourse
promissory notes with interest rates ranging from 6% to 7% and terms of 5
years. As of September 30, 2000, these notes were paid in full.
Under the Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options is at least
100% of the stock fair market value on the date of the grant for employees
owning less than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock, and at least
110% of the fair market value on the date of grant for employees owning more
than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock. For nonqualified stock
options, the exercise price is also at least 110% of the fair market value on
the date of grant for employees owning more than 10% of the voting power of all
classes of stock and no less than 85% for employees owning less than 10% of the
voting power of all classes of stock. Options expire 10 years after the date of
grant.
46           Keynote Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued B 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In September 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan Purchase Plan and reserved 400,000 shares of common stock for issuance
under this plan. The number of shares reserved under the Purchase Plan will
increase automatically on January 1 of each calendar year by a number of shares
equal to 1% of the Company outstanding shares on the preceding December 31.
Under the Purchase Plan, eligible employees may defer an amount not to exceed
10% of the employee compensation, as defined in the Purchase Plan, to
purchase common stock of the Company. The purchase price per share will be 85%
of the lesser of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of
the applicable offering period or the last day of each purchase period. The
Purchase Plan will be intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan
under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Through September 30, 2000,
73,256 shares had been issued under this plan, and 562,831 shares had been
reserved for future issuance.
C Stock-Based Compensation
The Company uses the intrinsic-value method in accounting for its employee
stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for any of its stock options granted because the exercise price of
each option equaled or exceeded the fair value of the underlying common stock
as of the grant date for each stock option, except for certain stock options
granted in fiscal 1999. For those option grants, the Company recorded deferred
stock compensation of $19 million for the difference at the grant date between
the exercise price of each stock option granted and the fair value of the
underlying common stock. This amount is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, generally four years.
Had the Company determined compensation costs based on the fair value at
the grant date for its stock options under SFAS No. 123 for all of the
Company stock-based compensation plans, net loss and basic and diluted net
loss per share would have been as follows                            Years Ended September 30,

Basic and diluted net loss per share:
As    011 $ 154 $ 110
Pro    048 $ 158 $ 111
The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The calculation includes the following
weighted-average assumptions: no dividends, expected volatility of 100% risk
free interest rate of 618%, 545%, and 555% for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, and expected life of 247, 250, and 284 years for fiscal 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.
The fair value of purchase rights granted under the Purchase Plan is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions for the grants in fiscal 1999:
no expected dividends, expected volatility of 100%, risk-free rate of 618% and
expected life of six months. The weighted-average fair value of the purchase
rights granted under the Purchase Plan during fiscal 1999 was $3483 per share.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued 9 Acquisitions
On June 2, 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of Velogic, Inc., a
California corporation Velogic, through a merger of a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company with and into Velogic the Velogic Merger, with
Velogic surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Velogic is a
provider of load-testing services for e-businesses. The Velogic Merger is
intended to be a tax-free reorganization and is accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting.
In connection with the Velogic Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of
830,684 shares of its common stock for all of the outstanding capital stock of
Velogic and assumed all stock options and warrants of Velogic, of which 166,137
shares are subject to an escrow to ensure certain indemnification obligations
of the former Velogic shareholders. The value of shares issued and stock
options assumed the purchase consideration was approximately $392 million.
In addition, if Velogic achieves certain revenue targets attributed to Velogic
products and services in 2000, the Company will be obligated to issue to the
former Velogic shareholders additional shares of Keynote common stock or cash
having an aggregate value of up to approximately $39 million. The Company will
be obligated to issue an additional $39 million of Keynote common stock or
cash to the former Velogic shareholders if Velogic achieves certain revenue
targets in 2001. If these revenue goals are met, the Company could be obligated
to issue additional shares of its common stock, or cash, having an aggregate
value of up to approximately $78 million. The determination as to whether cash
or stock will be paid, if performance targets are met is at the sole discretion
of the Company.
The purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The
primary purchase adjustments related to recording goodwill of approximately
$364 million and other intangible assets of approximately $41 million.
Goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over thirty-six months. Amortization of goodwill and other intangible
assets related to the Velogic acquisition, for the year ended September 30,
2000 was $45 million. The consolidated statement of operations includes
activity of Velogic subsequent to the acquisition. As a result of the purchase,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued   The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999 was an increase of $46 million and $25 million,
respectively. The Company accounting for deferred taxes under SFAS No. 109
involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of
the Company deferred tax assets. To support the Company conclusion that a
100% valuation allowance was required, management primarily considered such
factors as the Company history of operating losses, the nature of the
Company deferred tax assets and the absence of taxable income in prior
carryback years. Although management operating plans assume taxable and
operating income in future periods, management evaluation of all the
available evidence in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets
indicates that such plans are not considered sufficient to overcome the
available negative evidence.
Approximately $38 million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets is attributable to employee stock option deductions, the benefit from
which will be allocated to additional paid-in capital when and if subsequently
realized.
The Company has net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. and France income
tax purposes of approximately $20,967,000 and $1,179,000, respectively,
available to reduce future income subject to income taxes. The U.S. net
operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire, if not utilized, in the year
2010. The France net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the
year 2005. In addition, the Company had $12,761,000 of net operating loss
carryforwards against taxable income in future years, for California state
income tax purposes. The state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to
expire, if not utilized, in the year 2003.
As of September 30, 2000, the Company had research credit carryforwards for
federal and California income tax purposes of approximately $489,000 and
$433,000, respectively, available to reduce future income taxes. The federal
research credit carryforwards begins to expire in the year 2010. The California
research credit carryforwards expire indefinitely.
Federal and California tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the
utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an
ownership change for tax purposes, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company has not yet determined whether an ownership change
occurred due to significant stock transactions in each of the reporting years
disclosed. If an ownership change occurred, utilization of the net operating
loss carryforwards could be reduced significantly.
12 Leases
The Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under noncancelable

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements--Continued   Rent expense for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998 was
approximately $1,356,000, $551,000 and $115,000, respectively.
On July 11, 2000, the Company entered into a lease agreement for an 188,000
square foot office building in San Mateo, California. Payments under this
operating lease are based on LIBOR, which covers a one to six month interest
term. Future minimum payments under this operating lease as of September 30,
2000, assume an average interest rate of 7% over a five-year period. In
connection with this operating lease, $850 million has been deposited in an
interest-bearing escrow account and is included in the balance sheet as
restricted cash at September 30, 2000.
13 Geographic, Segment, and Significant Customer Information
In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes
standards for the manner in which public companies report information about
operating segments in annual and interim financial statements. It also
establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,
geographic areas, and major customers. The method for determining what
information to report is based on the way management organizes the operating
segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing
financial performance. The Company chief operating decision-maker is
considered to be the chief executive officer CEO. The financial information
the CEO reviews is identical to that presented in the accompanying statements
of operations. Therefore, the Company has determined that it operates in a
single operating segment: developing and selling services to measure, assure
and improve the quality of service of web sites.
The Company markets its products primarily from its operations in the
United States. International sales are primarily to customers in Europe. These
sales and foreign-owned assets are not significant.
