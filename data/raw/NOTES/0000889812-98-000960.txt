Sterling Vision, Inc. and Subsidiaries
East Meadow, New York
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sterling
Vision, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1997 and
December 1996 and the related statements of operations, shareholders' equity,
and cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 1997. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Sterling Vision, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996 and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 1997,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

lease for any such location on or before December 6, 1995; provided that any
such rejection would not result in any purchase price adjustment. As of
December 6, 1995, BOS rejected the leases for 66 of such locations and assumed
the leases for the remaining 32 locations. Payment of the purchase price
consisted of approximately $1,570,000 in cash, as well as the forgiveness of
all sums then due by Benson to Benson Eyecare Corporation BEC, which the
Company purchased from BEC in exchange for a Subordinated Debenture see
Footnote 15 Shareholders Equity in the original principal amount of
$5,900,000 and then having a discounted present value of approximately
$826,000. The sums forgiven represent the notes receivable and accounts
receivable in favor of BEC and acquired by the Company from BEC in exchange
for said Convertible Debenture. On November 15, 1995, the Company entered into
a one year non-compete and consulting agreement with one of the principals of
Benson for aggregate consideration of $150,000 which was included in the
purchase price. This transaction has been accounted for as a purchase, in
accordance with APB 16 and 17, with allocations made based upon the estimated
fair market value of the assets acquired.
On May 30, 1996, SVI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sterling
Vision DKM, Inc. DKM, acquired all of the retail optical assets, other
than leases which leases were assigned to the Company in three separate
agreements, of Vision Centers of America, Ltd., D & K Optical, Inc., Monfried
Corporation and Duling Finance Corporation collectively, VCA, which assets
were subject to a lien in favor of Norwest Investment Services, Inc.
Norwest the VCA Transaction. Norwest was entitled to exercise its
rights as a secured creditor of VCA as a result of VCA default with respect
to its obligations to Norwest. The assets acquired consisted primarily of
inventory, the fixed assets of 13 company-owned and operated retail optical
stores, the fixed assets of an ophthalmic lens manufacturing facility and the
assets located at several warehouses, general intangibles other than store
leases including franchise agreements, promissory notes and accounts
receivable related to approximately 75 franchised retail optical storses.
DKM purchased the assets at a private foreclosure sale subject to certain
liens, claims and encumbrances; however, Norwest indemnified DKM for certain
of such liens, claims and encumbrances. In addition, VCA assigned to DKM all
of its right, title and interest in and to each of the store leases in
exchange for DKM payment to VCA of $50,000 and the assumption of all of the
obligations under such store leases, subject to DKM right, in its sole
discretion, to reject the lease for any such locations on or before September
30, 1996. DKM also subsequently purchased from a bank, for the approximate sum
of $111,000, all of such bank right, title and interest in and to certain
additional prior liens, held by such bank, against VCA inventory, accounts
receivable and franchise agreements. This transaction has been accounted for
as a purchase in accordance with APB 16 and 17, with allocations made based
upon the estimated fair market value of the assets acquired.
On April 1, 1997, SVI acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares
of the capital stock of Singer Specs, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and
certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries collectively, Singer, pursuant to
the terms of a certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated February
19, 1997 the Singer Agreement, between the Company and the owners
collectively, the Singer
33 Shareholders of all of such capital stock of Singer Specs, Inc. As of the
closing, Singer was the: i operator of four retail optical stores
collectively, the Singer Company Stores; ii franchisor of an additional,
approximately27 other retail optical stores, all of which company operated and
franchised stores are located in the States of Pennsylvania, Delaware, New
Jersey and Virginia, and a store that opened in the U.S. Virgin Islands in
July 1997; and iii owner of a commercial building the Building located
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania collectively, the Singer Transaction.
The Singer Agreement provided for the Singer Shareholders to convey all
of said capital stock to the Company, free and clear of any and all claims,
liens and/or encumbrances, in exchange for shares of the Company Common
Stock, subject to certain post closing adjustments.
The Singer Agreement provided: i that the assets of each of the
Singer Company Stores be conveyed to corporations owned by one or more of the
Singer Shareholders, which entities, simultaneously with the closing, each
entered into a Sterling Optical Center Franchise Agreement; ii for the
pledge, by the Singer Shareholders, of all of their shares of Common Stock, to
secure their obligations under the Singer Agreement; iii that the Singer
Shareholders be restricted from selling a portion of their shares of said
Common Stock, all as more particularly set forth in the Singer Agreement; iv
for the requirement that the Company, under certain circumstances, pay to the
Singer Shareholders the difference between the market price of its Common
Stock upon which the purchase price was calculated and the selling price
net of 50% of commissions of any such shares sold by the Singer
Shareholders; and v the possible recapture, by the Company, of up to 12,192
shares of the Common Stock issued to the Singer Shareholders in the event all
of the Singer franchisees did not, within a specified period of time after the
closing, convert their existing Singer Franchise Agreement to the Company
then current form of Franchise Agreement. This transaction has been accounted
for as a purchase, effective April 1, 1997, in accordance with APB 16 and 17,
with allocations made based upon the estimated, fair market value of the
assets acquired. Franchise agreements are being amortized over a period of ten
years.
The Company, under the terms of the Singer Agreement, paid to the
Singer Shareholders approximately $143,000, which represented the difference
between the market price of its Common Stock upon which the purchase price
for the capital stock of Singer was calculated and the selling price net of
50% of commissions generated from their sale of approximately 100,000 shares
of the Company Common Stock.
The following table reflects the unaudited pro forma combined results
of operations of the Company, assuming that the
acquisition of Singer had taken place on January 1, 1996.

NOTE 2 - INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING      Reorganization      In December 1995, SVI issued 2,200,000 shares of its Common Stock at
$750 per share in an initial public offering the Offering. Proceeds from
the Offering as of December 31, 1995, net of commissions and other related
expenses totaling
34 1,855,000, were $14,791,000.
Immediately prior to the Offering, the Company effected a
4,50633:1 stock split subject to rounding upward in the case of any
fractional shares held by any shareholder in the form of a Common Stock
dividend. In addition, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment
to SVI Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized
shares of Common Stock from 5,000, no par value, to 33,000,000 shares, of
which 28,000,000 are Common Stock, par value $01 per share, and 5,000,000
shares are Preferred Stock, par value $01 per share. All share and per share
data included in these financial statements have been restated to reflect the
stock split.
As part of the Offering, the Company issued 44,000 shares of Common
Stock to certain legal consultants to the Company in consideration for past
services rendered to the Company in connection with the Company 1992
acquisition of IPCO Corporation IPCO. The Company capitalized the sums not
previously expressed, in the amount of $175,000, which sum is being amortized
over seven years.
The Company issued 4,002 and 80,040 shares of its Common Stock
during the calendar years ended December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996,
respectively, to the franchisees of those franchised stores in existence on
the date of the consummation of the Offering, in consideration of future
performance in accordance with the terms of their respective Franchise
Agreements. The fair value of such shares is being amortized over the vesting
period of three years.
NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES      Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SVI
and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Revenue recognition
Except in limited circumstances, the Company charges each
franchisee a nonrefundable initial franchise fee. This fee is used, in part to defray certain costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection
with its franchising activities. Initial franchise fees are recognized at the
time all material services required to be provided by the Company have been
substantially performed. Franchise royalties are based upon the gross revenues
of each location and are recorded as earned.
Interest earned on franchise notes receivable is recorded as earned
and is included in other income. Gains or losses from the conveyance of
Company-owned store assets to franchisees are recognized upon closing, net of
applicable reserves for collectibility.
Allowance for possible losses
The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 114 SFAS 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan. SFAS 114 defines impairment as the probability that all amounts due
under a loan agreement will not be collected according to the contractual
terms, and requires the valuation of impaired loans based on either the
present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan
effective interest rate, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is
collateral dependent. The Company measures the impairment of its notes
receivable based upon the fair market value of the underlying collateral,
which is determined on an individual note basis. In arriving at the fair
market value of the collateral, numerous factors are considered, including
market evaluations of the underlying collateral and franchise fees collected
from the franchisee, less selling costs, discounted at market discount rates.
If, upon completion of the valuations, the fair market value of the underlying
collateral securing the impaired note is less than the recorded investment in
the note, an allowance is created with a corresponding charge to expense. The
adequacy of the allowance is predicated on the assumption that the Company
will be able to hold these assets, dispose of them, and realize the fair
market value of these assets in the ordinary course of business. Adjustments
may be necessary in the event that effective interest rates, future
performance, economic conditions or other relevant factors vary significantly
from those assumed in estimating the allowance for possible losses. The
existing allowances will be either increased or decreased based upon future
valuations, with a corresponding
35 increase or reduction in the provision for note losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and any investment with a
maturity of 90 days or less.
Fair value of financial instruments      At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the carrying value of financial
instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables and
credit facilities, approximated their fair value, based on the short-term
maturities of these instruments.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a
first-in, first-out basis or market value, and consist primarily of contact
lenses, ophthalmic lenses, eyeglass frames and sunglasses.
Earnings per share
Effective December 15, 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share. Statement No. 128
replaced the previously reported primary and fully diluted earnings per share
with basic and diluted earnings per share. Under the new requirements for
calculating earnings per share, the dilutive effect of stock options will be
excluded from basic earnings per share but included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share. All earnings per share amounts have been restated
so as to comply with Statement No. 128.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment acquired in an acquisition are recorded
at their fair market value as of the date of acquisition. Other fixed asset
acquisitions are carried at cost. Stores reacquired by the Company are
recorded at the lower of their fair market value or the book value of the
assets exchanged for the store in question. Depreciation is provided on a
straight-line basis over the estimated life of the respective classes of
assets.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS
109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS 109, a deferred tax liability
or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements, and their respective tax bases.
Accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as
well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Amortization of debt discount
At the March 13, 1997 meeting of the Emerging Issues Task Force,
the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC issued an
announcement regarding accounting for the issuance of convertible debt
securities. The announcement dealt with, among other things, the belief, by
the SEC, that any beneficial conversion features on future conversions of debt
securities increase the effective interest rate of the securities and should,
therefor, be reflected as a charge to earnings. During the quarter ended March
31, 1997, the Company issued $8 million principal amount of its Convertible
Debentures Due August 25, 1998 the Debentures, which Debentures provide
for conversion features that permit the holders thereof to convert their
Debentures to shares of the Company Common Stock at a discount from the
market price at the time the Debentures were issued see Note 15. Although
the date of this pronouncement was subsequent to the Company issuance of the
Debentures, it is the Company opinion that the SEC intended this
announcement to apply retroactively.
36      Amortization of intangibles
Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the applicable
financing agreement. Excess of cost over net assets acquired, in the
approximate amount of $2,500,000, is being amortized over ten years. Deferred
leasing costs are amortized over the remaining life of the lease. Excess of
fair value of assets acquired over cost is being amortized over five years.
All amortization is on a straight line basis.
Pro forma tax provision unaudited
The unaudited pro forma income tax provision presented for the year
ended December 31, 1995 was prepared assuming an effective combined federal
and state tax rate of 40%.
Accounting for long-lived assets
Effective for the calendar year ended December 31, 1996, the Company
adopted SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121. The Company has recorded an
asset impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 1997 see Note 6 -
Property and Equipment.
Recent Accounting Requirements
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for
periods beginning after December 15, 1997. Management is presently evaluating
the effect on the Company financial reporting requirements from the adoption
of this statement, and does not expect that it will have any material effect.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information, SFAS No. 131 requires the reporting
of profit and loss, specific revenue and expense items, and assets for
reportable segments. It also requires the reconciliation of total segment
revenues, total segment profit or loss, total segment assets, and other
amounts disclosed for segments to the corresponding amounts in the general
purpose financial statements. SFAS No. 131 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1997. Management is presently evaluating the
impact on the Company financial reporting requirements from the adoption of
this statement.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial
statements in order to maintain consistency for comparative purposes. These
reclassifications had no effect on the net income for any period.
NOTE 4 - INCOME TAXES    For periods prior to the Offering, the Company was an S Corporation for
federal tax purposes and in certain state tax jurisdictions. The Company
income for such periods was included in the individual income tax returns of
the Company shareholders. Accordingly, the tax provisions for such periods
reflect only state and local taxes in those jurisdictions not recognizing S
Corporation status.
The Company status as an S Corporation was terminated as a result of
the Offering. Consequently, in accordance with SFAS 109, a deferred tax
liability was recognized for the estimated future tax effect of temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying values of assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Such taxes, which prior to the
Offering would have been paid by such shareholders, became a future obligation
of the Company. Substantially all of the tax provision for the calendar year
ended December 31, 1995 is attributable to this deferred tax liability.
37    A reconciliation of the income tax expense benefit is as follows                                     1997        1996        1995

Total                      $  0        $2,001      $2,129
The appropriate tax effect of each type of temporary difference and
carryforward that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax
assets and liabilities are as follows                                     1997        1996
Deferred tax asset:
Net operating loss                        $ 6,322      $ 2,856
Other temporary differences                      585        481
Subtotal                               6,907       3,337

2,712       2,432
Net deferred tax asset / liability                 $  0       $   0
Under SFAS 109, the Company cannot recognize a deferred tax asset for
the future benefit of its net operating loss carryfowards unless it concludes
that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be
realized. Although the Company believes it has taken measures to improve the
financial performance of the Company in 1998, the Company has recorded a full
valuation allowance against its otherwise recognizable deferred tax asset
until such time that the Company demonstrates profitability, which would
enable it to realize such deferred tax asset.    At December 31, 1997 the Company had a net operating loss carryforward
of approximately $16,500,000 available to offset future taxable income. The
net operating loss carryforward expires in varying amounts through 2,012 and
may be limited in certain circumstances.
38    A reconciliation between the statutory Federal income tax rate and the
effective income tax rate based on continuing operations is as follows                                       1997     1996    1995

Company held franchise notes receivable consist primarily of purchase
money notes relating to Company-financed conveyances of Company store asset,
to franchisees, as well as certain franchise notes receivable acquired by the
Company, and are secured by the underlying assets of the franchised store in
question, as well as, in most instances, personal guarantees of the principal
owners of the franchise. Interest is charged at various rates, commensurate
with the year of issue. Complete collection of these receivables is expected
by September 2004.
39    The residual value of franchise notes receivable represent notes
acquired from IPCO and are currently being held as collateral by Sanwa
Business Credit Corporation Sanwa and The CIT Group/Equipment Financing
Inc. CIT securing obligations incurred by IPCO, which obligations the
Company did not assume. The collateral held by CIT was scheduled to be
returned to the Company on or about July 2000. However, the Company residual
value of the cash collateral and franchise notes pledged to CIT have been
reduced due to the application, by CIT, of such collateral to offset certain
franchise note forgiveness. The collateral held by Sanwa is the subject of
litigation between Sanwa and the Company. The Company maintains that it is
entitled to the residual value of such franchise notes pledged to Sanwa by
IPCO, and that the carrying amount thereof is collectible. However, such
litigation makes the Company unable to estimate the date that such residual
value will be returned to it.
Franchise Notes Receivable of approximately $12,400,000, at December 31,
1997, are pledged in connection with the STI Credit Agreement see Note 9 -
Debt.

Effective for the calendar year ended December 31, 1996, the Company
adopted SFAS 121, which requires that long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the Company, be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of the assets exceeds the expected cash flows associated with
such assets and may not be recoverable.
As of December 31, 1997, the Company identified certain long-lived
assets, principally Company-owned stores, where there has been, or there is
expected to be, a change in circumstances which would affect the
recoverability of such long-lived assets. The Company has closed or will be
closing certain of its Company-owned stores; and, as such, the Company has
recorded a provision for closed stores of $1,336,000. Such amount includes
$564,000 in asset impairment costs in accordance with SFAS 121, and $772,000
in lease termination costs, of which $452,000 in lease termination costs are
included in current liabilities, and $320,000 is included in non- current
liabilities. In 1996 and 1995 costs related to closed stores were not
significant.

On November 6, 1997, the Company entered into a Master Grid Note
Grid Note with Chase Manhattan Bank the Bank that provided the Company
with a short-term loan of up to $1,000,000. The maturity date of the Grid Note
was February 6, 1998; however, such maturity date was extended, by the Bank,
to March 9, 1998 and was paid by the Company on such date see Note 19 -
Subsequent Events. Interest was calculated on the outstanding principal
balance at 3/4 of one percent over the prime rate approximately 8 1/2 % at
December 31, 1997 then in effect from time to time. As of December 31, 1997,
the outstanding principal balance of the Grid Note was $1,000,000.
On June 30, 1997, the Company entered into a loan agreement the
Loan Agreement with STI Credit Corporation STI that: i established,
in favor of the Company, a $20,000,000 credit facility to finance a portion of
the Company currently existing and future franchise promissory notes
receivable; and, ii funded $10,000,000, although $1,000,000 [the Additional
Funds] of the funded amount was withheld pending the Company satisfaction
of a required collateral ratio with respect to such credit facility less a
facility fee equal to two percent of the amount of the loan. Sixty-five
percent 65% of the funded amount is to be repaid by the Company over a term
of 60 months, with a final balloon payment at the expiration of the
sixty-first month of the term of said loan. The Company granted to STI a first
priority, continuing security interest in a substantial portion of its
franchise notes and the proceeds related to such notes. A portion of the net
proceeds approximately $6,100,000 of the loan was used to satisfy, pay and
discharge, in full, all amounts then due by the Company to: i the Bank
$5,035,000, together with accrued interest thereon, in the approximate amount
of $37,000; and ii certain principal shareholders of the Company
$1,000,000, together with accrued interest thereon, in the approximate amount
of $9,000. As a result of the foregoing: i the Bank lien upon, and
security interest in, substantially all of the Company assets previously
securing the Bank various loans to the Company was discharged; and ii
restrictions previously imposed upon the Company pursuant to the Company
Credit Agreement with the Bank are no longer applicable.
On October 9, 1997, STI amended the Loan Agreement and disbursed a
portion of the Additional Funds to the Company. As of December 31, 1997, the
outstanding principal balance of such loan was approximately $8,600,000.
Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company must comply with the
following financial covenants: i the maintenance of positive, annual net
income for each of its calendar years; ii working capital of not less than
$2 million; iii shareholders' equity of not less than $26 million; and iv
from and after June 30, 1998, a collateral ratio of 12 to 10. As of December
31, 1997, the Company was not in compliance with the financial covenants
described in clauses i and iii above, although STI subsequently waived
such non-compliance in exchange for the Company agreement to, which Waiver
amended the Loan Agreement so as to: i waive the Company compliance with
all of its financial covenants until December 31, 1998; ii reduced such
shareholders' equity requirement to $25 million; iii provide for a
prepayment penalty of $500,000; and iv require the Company to provide
certain additional documents to STI, as well as pay certain fees to STI, in
the aggregate amount of $70,000.      As of December 31, 1997, the Company was the lessee of six excimer
lasers and ancillary equipment under capital leases expiring in various years
through 2001. The assets and liabilities under capital leases are recorded at
the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value
of the asset.
On April 21, 1997, the Company entered in a Note Amendment and
Conversion Agreement the BEC Agreement with BEC, the holder of two
promissory notes each having an original term of 25 months and in the
original principal amounts of $1,050,000 and $200,000, respectively issued by
the Company in connection with its acquisition the Pembridge Transaction,
on August 26, 1994, from Pembridge Optical Partners, Inc. Pembridge, of
the assets of eight retail optical stores. Pursuant to the BEC Agreement: i
the Company, on June 9, 1997, prepaid the principal balance of but not
accrued interest on each of said promissory
42 notes in registered shares of its Common Stock; and ii the Company, was
required to pay to BEC the difference between the market price of its Common
Stock upon which the number of shares issued to BEC was calculated and the
selling price of any such shares sold by BEC.
The Company, under the terms of the BEC Agreement, paid to BEC
approximately $167,000, which represents the difference between the market
price of its Common Stock upon which the number of shares issued to BEC, in
prepayment of the promissory notes discussed above, was calculated and the
selling price of a portion of such shares issued to BEC.
As part of the Benson Transaction, the Company issued a non-negotiable,
subordinated convertible debenture the Benson Debenture in the principal
amount of $5,900,000, subject to reduction and payable, without interest, on
September 15, 2015. The Benson Debenture is subordinated to all existing and
future indebtedness, debts and obligations of the Company. The Company had a
right of offset against the principal amount of the Benson Debenture in the
event the Company did not retain at least 40 of the 98 Benson stores acquired
by the Company in the Benson Transaction, which right of offset was equal to
$147,000 for each store less than 40 that the Company retained. In December
1995, the Company elected to assume the leases for 32 stores and,
consequently, was entitled to reduce the principal amount of the Benson
Debenture by the sum of $1,176,000 from $5,900,000 to $4,724000. The Benson
Debenture is included in long-term debt is recorded at its present value of
$1,053,000 using an imputed internal interest rate of 85% see Footnote 15 -
Shareholders' Equity.

depreciation of $1,448,000 and $729,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997
and 1996, respectively.
NOTE 10 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    The Company is, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the
ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, there are no
significant claims outstanding that are likely to have a material adverse
effect upon the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
The Company leases locations for the majority of both its operated and
franchised stores. Minimum future rental payments as of December 31, 1997 for
Company operated stores and stores subleased to franchisees, for five years
and thereafter, in the aggregate, are approximately    For the

43    The Company holds the master lease on substantially all franchised
locations and, as part of the franchise agreement, sublets the subject
premises to the franchisee. Most master leases are subject to common area
charges and additional rent based upon sales volume. As required by SFAS 13
Accounting for Leases, the Company amortizes its rent expense on a
straight-line basis over the life of the related lease. Rent expense was
$5,554,000, $5,185,000 and $3,810,000, net of sublease rentals of
approximately $8,190,000, $9,279,000 and $8,052,000, for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Such rent expense includes
additional rent expense, based upon sales volumes of $52,000, $108,000 and
$117,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
The Company is a guarantor of indebtedness of two separate loans by two
franchisees to third party lenders in the principal amounts of $425,000 and
$250,000, respectively.
NOTE 11 - CONCENTRATION OF RISK    The Company operates retail optical stores in North America,
predominantly in the United States. Profitability of the Company and
collectibility of all receivables from franchisees is contingent upon the
financial condition of the industry, as well as the overall economic
environment.
In addition, as of December 31, 1997, the Company had deposits in banks
that are in excess of the $100,000 of depository insurance provided by the
Federal Depository Insurance Corporation.
NOTE 12 - SYSTEMWIDE SALES UNAUDITED    Systemwide sales represent the combined retail sales of Company owned
and franchised stores, as well as revenues generated by the Company health
maintenance organization, Vision Care of California.
NOTE 13 - RETAIL OUTLET COMPOSITION UNAUDITED    The number of Company-owned and franchised stores was as follows                           As of December 31,
1997     1996     1995
Company-owned                  50      62      71

313     319     221
The Company has an option, but not an obligation, to reacquire a
franchised store upon the occurrence of a default under the applicable
Franchise Agreement. The Company reacquired the assets of four, eight and four
franchised stores in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Losses of
approximately $453,000, 101,000 and $98,000 were recognized in 1997, 1996 and
1995, respectively, on these reacquired stores due to the write-off of
accounts receivable from the franchisees thereunder. In addition, as of
December 31, 1997, the Company is managing six franchised stores on behalf of
certain of its franchisees.
NOTE 14 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    Included in indebtedness from related parties are $110,000 and
$124,000, in loans to a former officer of the Company at December 31, 1997 and
1996, respectively, bearing interest at the prime rate.
On October 31, 1995, as a condition of the contemplated Offering, the
Company agreed to require three related party franchisees to reconvey their
franchises to independent franchisees, which related party franchisees agreed
to do. During 1996, two stores were sold by the related party franchisees
thereof, and the Company continues to manage the remaining store for an
officer of the Company. The franchisees of this Company managed store have
agreed to be liable for any cash losses up to their equity, if any, in the
franchise as of the date such franchise may be sold by the Company to an
independent franchisee.
In November 1996, certain of the Company principal shareholders
provided short-term financing to the Company of approximately $2,000,000,
which was repaid by the Company see Note 9 - Debt and Note 15 - Shareholders'
Equity. In partial consideration thereof, such principal shareholders
received options, under the Company Stock Incentive Plan, to purchase an
aggregate of 200,001 shares of the Company Common Stock at an exercise price
of $64375, which options expire on December 31, 2000.
44    In March, 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with a director
of the Company pursuant to which he agreed to serve as an advisor to, and as
the Chairman of the Board of Directors of, Insight, in exchange for annual
compensation of $75,000. In connection therewith, the Company granted to such
director, under its Stock Incentive Plan, options to purchase up to an
aggregate of 310,000 shares of the Company Common Stock at an exercise price
of $600, which options have a term of ten years. As of December 31, 1997,
160,000 of such options had vested and, in February, 1998, the balance of such
options were cancelled.
On April 7, 1997, the Company entered into an Option and Consulting
Agreement with Meadows Management, LLC, a limited liability company owned by
two of the Company principal shareholders and directors Meadows. Said
agreement provided for the Company payment, to Meadows, of consulting fees
of $25,000 per month through the expiration date thereof, December 31, 1997.
As additional consideration, the Company also granted to such principal
shareholders, under its Stock Incentive Plan, an aggregate of 300,000
qualified stock options, which options have a term of five years and are
exercisable at $89375.
On December 12, 1997, the Company granted, under its Stock Incentive
Plan, an aggregate of 200,000 options to a director of the Company in exchange
for his providing and continuing to provide assistance to the Company with
respect to its third party, managed care programs. One third of such options
immediately vested, with the balance to vest in November, 1998. The options
have a term of five years and are exercisable at $64375.
The Company shares an office building with a retail optical company,
both of which are owned by certain of the principal shareholders and directors
of the Company. Occupancy costs are appropriately allocated based upon the
applicable square footage leased by the respective tenants.
NOTE 15 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY    On February 26, 1997, the Company entered into Convertible Debentures
and Warrants Subscription Agreements with certain investors in connection with
the private placement the Private Placement of units collectively, the
Units consisting of an aggregate of $8,000,000 principal amount of the
Company Debentures and an aggregate of 800,000 warrants collectively, the
Warrants, each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share
of SVI Common Stock, at a price to be determined in accordance with a
specified formula and, for each two Warrants exercised within a specified
period of time, an additional warrant collectively, the Bonus Warrants to
purchase one additional share of Common Stock at a price of $750 per share.
The Company used the net proceeds approximately $7,500,000 of the Private
Placement to: i repay a portion of the loans made to it by certain principal
shareholders of the Company $1,000,000, together with interest thereon, in
the approximate amount of $50,000, and ii pay down the Company revolving
line of credit $1,000,000 with the Bank.
The Debentures bear no interest and mature on August 25, 1998, at which
time, subject to certain conditions, all Debentures not previously converted
or redeemed, shall automatically be converted into registered shares of Common
Stock.
In July 1997, the Company elected, in connection with its Private
Placement, to pay one of the holders of its 1997 Debentures the sum of
$460,000, which represented the redemption price for the conversion of
$400,000 principal amount of Debentures.
The Debentures are convertible at a price per share the
Conversion Price equal to the lesser of $650 or 85% of the average closing
bid price of the Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market System
Nasdaq for the 5 trading days immediately preceding the date of
conversion; provided, however, that the Company has the right to redeem that
portion of the Debentures requested to be converted in the event the
Conversion Price is $600 or less. In such event, the redemption price will be
equal to 115% of the face amount of that portion of the Debentures requested
to be converted. As of December 31, 1997, all of the Debentures, except those
with a carrying amount of $1,652,000, were converted by the holders thereof;
and, as of March 31, 1998, the remaining balance of such Debentures had been
converted.
The Warrants are exercisable until February 26, 2000. If a holder
of a Warrant exercises a Warrant at any time during the 2 year period
following the effectiveness of the Company registration statement with
respect thereto, which registration statement was declared effective by the
SEC on May 30, 1997, such holder will receive, for each two Warrants exercised
within such time, an additional Bonus Warrant entitling the holder thereof to
purchase one additional share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $750
per share, which Bonus Warrants have a term of 3 years from the date of grant
and the Company has agreed to maintain the
45 effectiveness of such registration statement until the earlier of: i 3
years; and ii the date all of the shares underlying the Debentures have been
sold and the Warrants and the Bonus Warrants have been exercised.
Utilizing the conversion terms most beneficial to the purchasers of
the Units, the Company has recorded in the accompanying financial statements
amortization of debt discount of approximately $5,916,000, which charge is
being credited to the Company paid-in-capital Shareholders' Equity over
the period of time that the holders of the Debentures actually convert the
same into shares of the Company Common Stock. The non-cash portion of the
discount is $5,436,000. Accordingly, once all of the Debentures have been so
converted by the holders thereof March, 1998 such discount will have no
effect on the Company Shareholders' Equity. This amount represents the 
intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature which is inherent in the 
conversion term of the Debenture, and the fair value of the Warrants with an 
assumed exercise price of $650 and the Bonus Warrants with an assumed 
exercise price of $750, issued with the debentures and the issuance cost of 
the Units. This discount was amortized, as additional interest expense, over 
the minimum period the debentures became convertible.
On May 9, 1997, the Company filed, with the SEC, a registration
statement on Form S-3 seeking registration, under the Act, of an aggregate of
3,213,464 shares of its Common Stock, 2,477,506 shares being registered on
behalf of the investors in the Private Placement see Note 4 and the balance
being registered on behalf of the holders of the warrants issued to the
underwriters of the Offering and to the Company former president.
In April 1995, the Company adopted a Stock Incentive Plan the
Plan which permits the issuance of options to selected employees of, and
consultants to, the Company. The Plan, as amended in 1996 and 1997, reserves
35 million shares, of Common Stock for grant and provides that the term of
each award be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors the Committee charged with administering the Plan. Under the
terms of the Plan, options may be qualified or non-qualified and granted at
exercise prices and for terms to be determined by the Committee.

46       All outstanding options, except for 300,000, were non-qualified
options. During 1997, the Company recognized $755,000 of expense related to
its issuance of stock options to certain consultants to the Company and in
consideration of certain loans made to the Company by certain of its principal
shareholders.
In addition to stock options, the following outstanding item may
effect the number of common shares outstanding in future periods: 800,000
warrants and 400,000 bonus warrants which were issued in connection with the
Company issuance and sale of $8,000,000 principal amount of its Debentures
see Note 15-Shareholders' Equity and, upon exercise, would result in the
issuance of 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock.
At any time prior to the maturity date of the Benson Debenture,
the Company may, upon 30 days' prior written notice to Benson, exchange the
Benson Debenture for shares of its Common Stock at a ratio equal to the then
principal amount of the Benson Debenture, which, as of December 31, 1997, was
$1,054,000, divided by the average of the previous 20 days trading price of
the Common Stock. In the event that the average trading price of the Common
Stock is 350% or greater than $750, for a period in excess of 60 consecutive
business days, Benson may, upon 30 days prior written notice to the Company,
thereafter convert the Benson Debenture into Common Stock of the Company based
upon the above described ratios. In addition, the Benson Debenture affords
Benson certain piggyback registration rights covering the Common Stock into
which the Benson Debenture may be convertible, see Note 9 - Debt.
Additional Stock Plan Information
The Company continues to account for its stock-based awards using
the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees and it related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized in the financial statements for
employee stock arrangements.
SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires the
disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share had the Company
adopted the fair value method as of January 1, 1996. Under SFAS 123, the fair
value of stock-based awards to employees is calculated through the use of
option pricing models, even though such models were developed to estimate the
fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable options without vesting
restrictions, which significantly differ from the Company stock option
awards. These models also require subjective assumptions, including future
stock price volatility and expected time to exercise, which greatly affect the
calculated values. The Company calculations were made using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: expected life, varying between 36 and 60 months following
vesting; stock volatility, 32% and 21% in 1997 and 1996, respectively, risk
free interest rates, 6% and no dividends during the expected term. The
Company calculations are based on a multiple option valuation approach and
forfeitures are recognized as they occur. If the computed fair values of the
award had been amortized to expense over the vesting period of the awards, the
pro forma net incomeloss and earnings loss for common shares for the
calendar years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, would have been $15,510,000
or $112 per share, basic and diluted, and $5,229,000 or $42 per share,
basic and diluted, respectively. NOTE 16 - 401K EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS       On December 28, 1994, by unanimous written consent of the Board of
Directors of each of Sterling Vision, Inc., Sterling Vision of California,
Inc. and VisionCare of California, each such Company separately approved and
adopted, effective January 1, 1995, a 401k Employee Savings Plan the
401k Plan to provide all qualified employees of these entities with
retirement benefits. Presently, each such company pays the administrative
costs of each such 401k Plan, but does not provide any matching
contributions to any participants in any of the 401k Plans. It is the

NOTE 19 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    On February 17, 1998, the Company entered into Convertible Debentures
and Warrants Subscription Agreements with certain investors in connection with
the private placement of units consisting of an aggregate of $35 million
principal amount of convertible debentures as amended on March 25, 1998,
collectively, the 1998 Debentures and an aggregate of 700,000 warrants
collectively, the 1998 Warrants, which 1998 Warrants entitled the holders
thereof to purchase up to 700,000 shares of the Company Common Stock, at a
price of $500 per share. The Company used the net proceeds approximately
$33 million of the private placement: i to repay certain loans previously
made to it $1,700,000, together with interest thereon; and ii the balance
for general corporate purposes.
Subsequent to the date of the Company issuance and sale of the 1998
Debentures and 1998 Warrants, the Company and the Holders thereof
collectively, the Original Holders, determined that the issuance and sale
of such 1998 Debentures and 1998 Warrants was based upon a certain mutual
mistake of the Company and the Original Holders. Accordingly, on April 14,
1998, the Company and Original Holders entered into an Exchange Agreement,
effective as of February 17, 1998, pursuant to which the 1998 Debentures were
exchanged for $35 million Stated Value of a series of the Company Preferred
Stock, par value $01 per share, the Preferred Stock and the 1998 Warrants
were exchanged for new warrants the Warrants, entitling the holders
thereof to purchase up to 700,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $500
per share the Conversion Price', until February 17, 2001.
The Preferred Stock: i requires the Company to pay quarterly
dividends thereon, commencing May 17, 1998, calculated at the rate of ten
10% percent per annum; ii permits the Company to pay such dividends in
registered shares of its Common Stock; iii permits the holders thereof, at
any time prior to redemption by the Company, to convert all or a portion of
the same into shares of Common Stock based upon the Conversion Price; iv
requires the Company to redeem in either cash or registered shares of its Common
Stock, at the company option, all but not less than all of the Debentures, 
all of the sameat 105% of the then, outstanding Stated Value thereof, based
upon the Conversion Price; hereinafter, the Redemption Amount at any time
from and after February 17, 1999 that a registration statement pursuant to
which the Common Stock [into which the Preferred Stock may be converted] has
been registered is effective; v permits the Company to redeem all but not
less than all of the Debentures, in cash and at the Redemption Amount, at any
time from and after February 17, 1999; and viprovides that from and after
February 18, 1999, the Company will be required to pay dividends thereon, until
the same are redeemed by the Company, at the rate of twenty-four 24% percent
per annum.
49    The Company is required to file with the SEC a Registration Statement
on behalf of the holders of the Preferred Stock with respect to all of the
shares of Common Stock into which the same may be converted, as well as all of
the Common Stock underlying the Warrants;; and the Company has agreed to
maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement until the earlier
of: i three years; and ii the date that all of the shares of Common Stock
into which the Preferred Stock may be converted are sold and the Warrants
have been exercised.
On March 9, 1998, the Company paid, in full, the entire amount
$1,000,000 of the Grid Note due by the Company to the Bank. NOTE 20 - RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT PLANS    For the calendar year ended December 31, 1997, the Company incurred a
loss of approximately $14,162,000, which was primarily due to the following
eleven factors: i a charge against earnings, in the approximate amount of
$5,916,000, as a result of the Company issuance, in February, 1997, of the
Debentures, the non-cash portion of which charge $5,436,000 which discount
is being credited to the Company paid-in-capital Shareholders' Equity over
the period of time that the holders of the Company Debentures actually
convert the same to shares of the Company Common Stock see Note 15; ii a
loss of approximately $1,400,000 from the operations of Insight which the
Company believes will be substantially reduced in 1998; iii approximately
$772,000 in lease termination costs related to planned store closings; iv
approximately $564,00 in asset impairment costs; v approximately $850,000 in
the writedown of the carrying value of slow moving inventory; vi
approximately $550,000 in operating losses relating to the Company
management of six stores, previously operated by the franchisees of such
stores; vii approximately $755,000 in costs related to stock options granted
to certain consultants to the Company and in consideration of certain loans
made to the Company by certain of its principal shareholders; viii
approximately $200,000 in costs related to severance compensation paid to
three former executives; ix approximately $188,000 in consulting fees paid
to Meadows; x approximately $188,000 in costs related to compensation paid
to the Company new President and Chief Operating Officer; and xi
approximately $270,000, representing an increase in the Company provision
for doubtful accounts.
The Company has taken the following measures which it believes will
improve its operations and cash flow in 1998: i closed five Company-owned
underperforming stores and planned to close an additional six Company-owned
underperforming stores in the first quarter of 1998; and ii reduced or
eliminated certain administrative overhead expenses.
In 1997, the Company formulated a new business strategy for Insight
operations, which the Company believes: i will continue to reduce the
Company losses attributable to Insight; and ii is consistent with the
Company plan to become a full-service eyecare company. Accordingly, the
Company has developed affiliations with refractive laser surgeons, whereby
such surgeons pay to the Company a laser access fee to utilize the Company
excimer laser, as well as a fee to utilize the Company existing Insight
Laser Center facility located in New York City. Notwithstanding such changes,
the Company anticipates that Insight will continue to operate at a loss for
the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, however at an amount substantially
below that for the year ended December 31, 1997.
Although the Company believes that its financial condition will improve
for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, and anticipates that it will
generate a positive cash flow for such period, the Company, as of December 31,
1997, was not in compliance with certain of its existing financial covenants
as contained in its Loan Agreement with STI, which defaults were subsequently
waived by STI see Note 9 - Debt.
In February 1998, the Company entered into a Convertible Preferred
Stock and Warrants Subscription Agreement which provided net proceeds of
approximately $3,300,000 to the Company see Note 19 - Subsequent Events.
