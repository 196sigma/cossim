The Judge Group, Inc.
Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Judge Group,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and of cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Judge Group,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. RUDOLPH PALITZ, LLP

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996
NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The Judge Group, Inc. the Company formerly Judge Inc., a
Pennsylvania corporation founded in 1970, provides i information technology
IT and engineering professionals to its clients on both a temporary basis
through its Contract Placement business and a permanent basis through its
Permanent Placement business, ii computer network and document management
system integration, implementation, maintenance and training through its
Information Management Solutions business see Note 13 and iii information
technology training through its IT Training business on a range of software
and network applications to corporate, governmental and individual clients. At
December 31, 1998, the Company, headquartered in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania,
operated regional offices in sixteen states throughout the United States. A
substantial portion of the Company revenues are derived from customers located
in the Mid-Atlantic corridor of the United States.
The Contract Placement business includes the operations of two of the
Company wholly-owned subsidiaries, Judge Technical Services, Inc. JTS and
Judge Technical Services of N.J., Inc. JTNJ.
The Permanent Placement business includes the operations of three of the
Company wholly-owned subsidiaries, Judge, Inc., Judge Electronic Services of
Florida, Inc. JESF and Judge Inc. of New Jersey JINJ.
The IT Training business is comprised of the operations of The Berkeley
Associates Corp. Berkeley.
The Information Management Solutions business of the Company includes the
operations of Judge Imaging Systems, Inc. JIS which became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company at the closing of the Company initial public
offering in 1997. Prior to that time JIS was a public company, a majority of
whose shares was owned by the Company and certain officers and directors of the
Company, and which was consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
On September 4, 1996, The Boards of Directors of the Company and JIS
approved the merger of JIS into a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company the Merger. The terms of the Merger called for the conversion of
each share of JIS common stock not already owned by the Company and Series A
preferred stock into $250 of value based on the public offering price of The
Judge Group, Inc. common stock. Based upon the offering price of $750 per
share, the Company issued 1,194,230 shares of The Judge Group, Inc. common stock
to the shareholders of JIS at the closing of its initial public offering in
1997. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 and related
literature, the acquisition by the Company in the Merger of the majority of the
shares of JIS, which were owned by the Company, Martin E. Judge, Jr. or other
owners of the Company securities, was accounted for as a corporate
reorganization of entities under common control, at historical cost, similar to
pooling accounting. However, the acquisition by the Company in the Merger of the
remaining JIS shares the Minority Shares was accounted for in accordance
with purchase accounting whereby the pro rata portion of JIS assets and
liabilities were recorded at their fair values. The excess of the value of the
Company shares issued in exchange for the Minority Shares over the fair value of
the net assets attributable to the minority interest was recorded as goodwill.
During 1996, the Company engaged an investment banking firm to assist it
in an initial public offering of its common stock. On September 30, 1996, the
Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Effective
February 20, 1997 the Company successfully completed its initial public offering
of common shares. The Company sold 3,000,000 common shares at a price of $750
per share, realizing approximately $20,906,000 in proceeds net of underwriting
discounts and commissions. Immediately

notes exchanged them for 526,000 Company common shares. The Company issued
40,000 common shares in lieu of $300,000 of notes payable to Berkeley, in
accordance with the purchase agreement with Berkeley. In connection with the
initial public offering, the Company incurred approximately $1,694,000 of
accounting, legal, printing and other costs as of December 31, 1997 and such
costs have been charged to additional paid-in capital as a reduction of the
proceeds from the initial public offering.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, and the
Company wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
Risks and Uncertainties. The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Revenue Recognition in Contract Placement and Permanent Placement
Businesses. The Company recognizes permanent placement revenues at the date
employment of the placed professional commences, subject to reversal and
adjustments if such employment is terminated during a guarantee period. Revenues
related to temporary placement services are recognized on a weekly basis as the
services are performed.
Revenue Recognition in Information Management Services Business. Revenues
from the sales of network, imaging and document management systems is recognized
at the date of shipment of the system, provided that any work to complete
installation of the system is routine in nature and related costs, which are
accrued at the time revenue is recognized, are not significant. However, in
instances in which installation and development costs are significant to the
completion of the contract, revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion
basis. Revenues recorded on a percentage-of-completion basis are based upon
management estimates for which it is reasonably possible that such estimates
may change in the near term. Revenues billed in advance for computer sales,
warranties and maintenance contracts are deferred and recorded as income in the
period in which the merchandise is shipped or the services are rendered.
Deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December
31, 1998 and 1997 includes approximately $190,000 and $184,000, respectively, of
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on contracts-in-progress.
Revenue Recognition in IT Training Business. Tuition and fee revenues are
recognized generally when the classes are held. Payments received prior to the
class commencing are recorded as deferred revenues.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in
bank and other short-term investments with original maturities of three months
or less.
The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions. These
balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $100,000
at each institution.
Short-Term Investments. The Company records short-term trading
investments at fair market value which generally equals the cost of such
investments. These securities represent investments in municipal mutual funds
$1 par value and/or investments in municipal bonds with floating interest
rates and which allow the Company to redeem its investment on a weekly basis at
its original cost plus accrued interest. There were no realized gains or losses
on these investments in 1998 or 1997.

Inventories. Inventories of computer and related supplies and equipment
held for resale are valued at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market.
Inventories at December 31, 1998 and 1997 include approximately $614,000 and
$619,000, respectively, of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on
contracts-in-progress.
Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable. Accounts receivable at December
31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 were net of allowances for doubtful accounts of
$511,000, $465,000, and $661,000, respectively.
Included in accounts receivable was unbilled work-in-process of
approximately $1,134,000, $584,000 and $524,000 at December 31, 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively. Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses was
approximately $867,000, $442,000 and $283,000 of accrued employee and contractor
payroll principally relating to unbilled work-in-process at December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively.
The allowance for doubtful accounts is established through charges to
earnings in the form of a charge to bad debt expense. Accounts which are
determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance account.
Management makes periodic assessments of the adequacy of the allowance which
requires the Company to recognize additions or reductions to the allowance. It
is reasonably possible that factors may change significantly and, therefore,
affect management determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts in the
near term. An analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts follows                       Additions Reversals

Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Amortization. Property and
equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed on the
straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets, principally five to ten years for furniture, office and computer
equipment and five years for automotive equipment.
Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over
the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives of the improvements,
principally five to ten years.
Depreciation and amortization related to property and equipment, including
property under capital leases, amounted to $1,105,352 in 1998, $653,278 in 1997,
and $451,322 in 1996.
Property Under Capital Leases and Amortization. Property under capital
leases is stated at the lower of fair market value or net present value of the
minimum lease payments at inception of the leases. Property under capital leases
consists of furniture and office equipment and is included in property and
equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization is
provided over the shorter of the related lease terms or the estimated useful
lives of the related assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- Continued
Income Taxes. Deferred taxes are accounted for in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Statement No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. The Statement requires the use of the liability method to
account for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for the difference
between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the
financial statements and at the tax rates that are expected to be in effect when
the taxes are actually paid or recovered.
Deferred income taxes arise principally from differences between financial
and income tax reporting, including amounts recorded for workers' compensation
funding, amounts recorded for the allowance for doubtful accounts, the
availability of net operating loss carryforwards and certain other temporary
differences.
Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when,
based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
determination of the requirement for a valuation allowance is an estimate which
is reasonably possible to change in the near term.
Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of companies
acquired over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition and
is being amortized on the straight-line method over terms ranging from ten years
to twenty five years. Amortization of goodwill is based upon management
estimates, for which it is reasonably possible that such estimates may change in
the near term. Amortization of goodwill for the periods ended December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996 was approximately $704,744, $343,000 and $63,000 respectively, and
is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations.
The covenant not to compete is being amortized on a straight-line method
over the life of the covenant twenty-four months. Amortization expense related
to the covenant was approximately $37,000 for 1998.
Deferred Rent Obligation. The Company is party to operating lease
agreements for certain of its office facilities, which contain provisions for
free rent for a certain period, with subsequent rent increases. In accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company records monthly rent
expense equal to the total of the payments due over the lease terms, divided by
the number of months of the lease terms. The difference between rent expense
recorded and the amount paid is credited or charged to deferred rent obligation
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Deferred rent at December 31,
1998 also includes a liability of $400,000 with respect to the closing of the
Company New York City office see Non-recurring Charges below.
Non-recurring Charges. In 1998 the Company recorded pretax non-recurring
charges related to the impairment of purchased goodwill and an estimated loss
related to its lease commitment on the closing of its New York City office.
These charges are comprised of the following    Impairment of purchased goodwill:
Information Management Services           $2,914,099
IT Training                      707,000
Closing of New York City office              400,000
Total charges                  $4,021,099

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- Continued
Non-recurring Charges Continued
The impairment of purchased goodwill was a non-cash charge determined in
accordance with SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, due to continuing losses in those
segments. The SFAS 121 charge had no impact on the Company 1998 cash flow or
its ability to generate cash flow in the future. As a result of the SFAS 121
charge, amortization expense related to goodwill will decrease in future
periods. During the fourth quarter of 1998 the Company decided to cease
operations in its New York City office and recorded a charge to reserve for
future losses, primarily related to its lease commitment which has been recorded
at the net present value of the difference between the lease obligation and
related sublease income.
The effect of these non-recurring charges, net of tax effect, was $026
per common share.
Advertising Expenses. The Company participates in various advertising
programs. All costs related to advertising are expensed in the period incurred.
Advertising expense amounted to approximately $1,143,000, $696,000, and $532,000
in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards. In June 1997, the FASB issued
Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. This Statement establishes standards for the way that public
business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual
financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected
information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to
shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about
products and services, geographic areas and major customers. This Statement was
adopted for the year ended December 31, 1998.
Earnings Loss Per Share. The Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128 FAS 128, Earnings Per Share, beginning in the
fourth quarter of 1997. All prior period earnings per common share were
recomputed to conform to the provisions of FAS 128. The recomputations did not
result in any restatements in earnings per share previously reported.
The number of shares used in the earnings loss per share calculation and
convertible note share conversion see Note 6 has been adjusted for the 526
for 10 stock split which occurred in September 1996.
Basic earnings loss per share amounts are computed based on net income
loss, reduced increased by dividends earned on preferred stock outstanding
on JIS through February 1997 $6,700 and $45,000 for 1997 and 1996,
respectively, and divided by the weighted average number of shares actually
outstanding, reduced by Treasury Shares. The number of shares used in the
computation were approximately 13,458,000 in 1998, 12,761,000 in 1997, and
8,473,000 in 1996.
Diluted earnings loss per share amounts for years 1998, 1997 and 1996
are based on the weighted average number of shares calculated for basic earnings
loss per share purposes increased by the number of shares that would be
outstanding assuming exercise of outstanding stock warrants and assumed
conversion of convertible debt for 1997 and 1996. The number of shares used in
the computation were approximately 13,458,000 in 1998, 12,826,000 in 1997, and
9,114,000 in 1996. Outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock in
1998 and in 1997 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings loss
per share because the assumed exercise of the options would be anti-dilutive.
On February 26, 1998 the Company repurchased 40,000 shares of its common
stock at a price of $550 per share, which shares are held as Treasury Stock.
Reclassifications. Certain items in the 1997 financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the 1998 financial statement presentation.

NOTE 3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
In the year ended December 31, 1998 the Company, through its subsidiaries,
consummated several acquisitions which were accounted for as purchase
transactions, with the results of their operations included in the accompanying
financial statements since each of their respective purchase dates. In each
acquisition, the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired is
considered goodwill and is being amortized over terms ranging from fifteen years
to twenty-five years, beginning with the month following the acquisition. In
some instances, a portion of the related acquisition cost is included in other
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the payment
terms of which are dependent on the Company common stock price on future

In 1994, the Company received $500,000 from a group of investors in the
form of 10% convertible senior subordinated promissory notes. The notes were
exchanged for 526,000 Company common shares, immediately prior to the offering
see Note 1. The notes bear 10% interest per annum and were scheduled to mature
in July 1997. Since the Company effected a successful initial public offering
before July 31, 1997, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement, the
financial advisor who arranged such financing was paid a fee equal to 1% of the
proceeds of the initial public offering approximately $225,000 in February

NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES
The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return with all of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Prior to February 20, 1997, JIS was not included in
the Company consolidated Federal income tax return, as the Company owned less
than 80% of JIS outstanding common shares. Under Internal Revenue regulations,
JIS was not part of the consolidated group for tax purposes and filed their own
Federal income tax returns. Effective February 20, 1997, JIS began filing as
part of the consolidated group. State income taxes are determined on the basis
of filing separate returns for each company as required by the applicable state
regulations.
The net deferred tax asset at December 31, 1998 and 1997 included the

The effective tax rate for all periods presented was higher than the
applicable statutory tax rate, due to certain expenses that were not deductible
for tax purposes, Federal and state provisions at the maximum rates and net
operating losses for JIS, which was consolidated for financial reporting but not
tax reporting purposes prior to the merger of the Company and JIS in February
1997. A reconciliation of the Company effective income tax rate with the

As a result of operating losses, no provision for income taxes was
required for all periods prior to February 20, 1997 for JIS. JIS operating
losses subsequent to February 20, 1997 have been used in the consolidated tax
accrual. For income tax reporting purposes, as of December 31, 1998, JIS had an
unused operating loss carryforward of approximately $4,200,000, which may be
applied against future taxable income of JIS, subject to certain Federal income
tax limitations. These carryforwards expire between 2002 and 2012.
NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company and its subsidiaries lease office facilities under operating
lease agreements that expire at various times through the year 2008. Certain of
these leases contain optional provisions for additional periods of time. Rent
expense was approximately $2,480,000, $1,437,000 and $897,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Minimum annual future
rental commitments, net of subleases rents see Note 2, at December 31, 1998,
and exclusive of common area maintenance costs and utilities, are as follows    Year Ending December 31,            Amount

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued

NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES -- Continued
The Company is partially self-insured for health care claims for eligible
active employees. The Company is currently liable for aggregate claims up to
approximately $1,009,000 annually. Self-insurance costs are accrued based upon
the aggregate of the liability for reported claims and an estimated liability
for claims incurred but not reported.
The Company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in
existing computer systems as the Year 2000 approaches. The Year 2000 problem
is pervasive and complex, as many computer systems will be affected in some way
by the rollover of the two-digit year value to 00. Systems that do not properly
recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to
fail. The Year 2000 issue creates risk for the Company from unforeseen
problems in its own computer systems and from third parties for whom the Company
implements Year 2000 solutions on their computer systems.
The Company believes its recently implemented financial information system
is Year 2000 compliant. Further, the Company is currently in the process of
replacing its candidate and client databases utilized in its Contract Placement
and Permanent Placement businesses with software systems that are represeented
to be Year 2000 compliant. The Company is analyzing its remaining computer
systems to identify any potential Year 2000 issues and will take appropriate
corrective action based on the results of such analysis. Management has not yet
determined the cost related to achieving Year 2000 compliance. Management
believes, based on its available information, that it will be able to manage its
total Year 2000 transition without any material adverse effects on its
business operations or financial condition.
NOTE 9. RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company had various 401k retirement plans the Plans covering
substantially all employees through June 30, 1996. Employees were able to
contribute a percentage of their pre-tax salary to the Plans. Company
contributions to the Plans were at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
There were no Company contributions charged to operations related to the Plans
in 1996. Effective July 1, 1996, all the Plans were merged into one Plan. The
new Plan has no Company contribution provision, although employees may continue
to contribute a percentage of their pre-tax salary to the Plan.
NOTE 10. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE
Dividends. In accordance with the provisions of its line of credit, the
Company is not permitted to declare or pay any cash dividends on its common
stock.
Additional Paid-In Capital. During 1996, additional paid-in capital
decreased due to the JCC/DI merger which was accounted for as a reverse
acquisition.
Capital Structure. On September 4, 1996, the Company Board of Directors
voted to i modify the Company capital structure to increase the number of
authorized common shares to 50,000,000, ii adjust the par value per share from
$005 to $01, iii authorize the issuance of 10,000,000 preferred shares with
a par value of $01 per share, iv authorize a 526 for 10 split of the
outstanding common shares for shareholders of record on September 23, 1996, v
authorize a change in the Company name from Judge, Inc. to The Judge Group,
Inc. and vi authorize the formation of a new subsidiary, Judge, Inc., and the
contribution of substantially all the assets related to the Permanent Placement
business to this new subsidiary.
Common Shares -- Warrants. During 1993, the Company issued to a financial
advisor warrants to purchase 171,739 split-adjusted common shares of the
Company. During September 1996, such warrants were exercised.

Stock Option Plan. On September 4, 1996 the Company adopted an Incentive
Stock Option and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan the Incentive Plan for key
employees and non-employee directors. Options may be granted under the Incentive
Plan to purchase up to a maximum of 3,500,000 of the Company common shares,
subject to certain adjustments and restrictions. The price of each option shall
be the fair market value of the shares on the date of the grant. The options
granted are subject to a four year vesting schedule in equal increments
annually, and are exercisable any time after vesting up to 10 years from grant
date.
During 1998 and 1997, the Company granted two non-employee directors
options to purchase 10,000 common shares each at an exercise price of $4938 and
$325, respectively, under the Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan.
A summary of the Company Incentive Stock Option Plan activity for common
shares for the year ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 there were no options
granted in 1996 follows                                 Weighted Average

The Company accounts for its Incentive Plan in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized for the Incentive Plan. Had
compensation cost been determined in accordance with the fair value method of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123, the Company pro forma net income loss and net
income loss per share for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 would be
as follows:
1998        1997
Net Income loss:
As reported           $5,116,993    $2,711,940
Pro forma            $6,898,814    $2,117,278
Basic earnings loss per share:
As reported             $038       $021
Pro forma              $051       $017
The resulting pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of
that to be expected in future years.
The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions used for grants in 1998: risk-free interest rate of 510 expected dividend yields of 0%, expected life of five years from date of grant,
and expected price volatility of 131%. The weighted average fair value of the
options granted in 1998 was $359.
