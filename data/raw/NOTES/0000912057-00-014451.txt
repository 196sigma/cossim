To Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Sanchez Computer
Associates, Inc. a Pennsylvania corporation and subsidiaries as of December
31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial

responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Sanchez Computer Associates,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with

2  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
USE OF MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to continuously make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses at the date of the financial
statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. The most significant estimate is the
percentage-of-completion method for revenue recognition.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company generally recognizes product revenue, which includes software
license fees and product enhancement fees, using the
percentage-of-completion method over a period of time that commences with
the execution of the license and ends with the completion of the
enhancements or implementation. If the customer does not request
enhancements and implementation, the Company generally recognizes the
license fee from these products upon delivery, provided that the other
services are not essential to the functionality of the software. The
Company does not recognize any license fees unless persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, the license amount is fixed and determinable and
collectability is probable. The Company software licensing agreements
provide for a warranty period. The portion of the license fee associated
with the warranty period is unbundled from the license fee and is
recognized ratably over the warranty period.
Service revenues, which include client implementation and consulting fees,
are recognized when the services are performed or on the
percentage-of-completion method, depending on the contract terms. Revenue
from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of
the maintenance contract.
Contracts in process in the accompanying balance sheets represent revenues
recognized in excess of amounts collected or invoiced and deferred
revenues represent amounts collected from or invoiced to customers in
excess of revenue recognized.                     32             Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments
with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase and
whose carrying amount approximates market value due to the short maturity
of the investments. The Company maintains a centralized cash management
program whereby its excess cash balances are invested in high quality
short-term money market instruments. At times, cash balances in the
Company accounts may exceed federally insured limits. Cash and cash
equivalents at December 31, 1999 and 1998 include $0 and $12 million on
deposit with Safeguard Scientifics, Inc. Safeguard, a shareholder of

straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the
product. Generally, an original estimated economic life of four years is
assigned to capitalized software development costs. Costs of software
program maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Total costs capitalized in 1999, 1998 and 1997 were approximately $1,081,
$353, and $668 respectively. Accumulated amortization was $1,359 and $921
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Amortization of
capitalized software costs amounted to $551, $413, and $321 in 1999, 1998
and 1997, respectively. All capitalized software costs are written down to
net realizable value when the carrying amount is in excess thereof. No
write-downs were required for 1999, 1998 or 1997.
INCOME TAXES

the tax and financial reporting bases of the Company assets and

Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be
realized in future periods.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
Depreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives
of the related assets using a combination of accelerated and straight line
depreciation methods. Equipment and furniture and fixtures typically have
useful lives of three and five years, respectively. The useful life of

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Effective December 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which
simplifies the requirements for computing earnings per share and requires

weighted average common shares outstanding, while diluted earnings per

and diluted shares outstanding which includes the dilutive effect of stock
options and warrants. The following table provides a reconciliation of

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 137,
which deferred the effective date for SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000. The Company does not believe the effect of adopting
this standard will be material. In December 1999, the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB No. 101
expresses the views of the SEC in applying generally accepted accounting
principles to certain transactions. The Company is still in the process
of analyzing the impact of SAB No. 101 on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.
