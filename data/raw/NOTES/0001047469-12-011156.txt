Keynote Systems,Inc. and Subsidiaries      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Keynote Systems,Inc. was incorporated in June 1995 in California and reincorporated in Delaware in March 2000. Keynote Systems,Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company
develop and sell software, hardware and services to measure, test, assure and improve Internet and mobile communications quality of service. Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany account balances and transactions
have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements relate to revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing
reserve, the fair value of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in a business combination, useful lives of property, equipment, software and identifiable intangible assets, asset impairments, the fair value of awards granted under the
Company stock-based compensation plans and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial
statements. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments held at major banks, money market funds and other investments with
original maturities of three months or less. 
The
Company classifies all its investments as available-for-sale at the time of purchase since it is management intent that these investments be available for
current operations, and as such, includes these investments as short-term investments on its balance sheets. These investments consist of fixed-term deposits with original
maturities longer than three months and investments with original maturities longer than three months, including commercial paper and investment-grade corporate and government debt securities with
Moody ratings of A3 or better. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and
losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations based on
specific identification. 
Financial Instruments 
The carrying value of the Company financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair market value due to their short-term nature. Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. 
Fair Value Measurements 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair 
57 
Table of Contents Keynote Systems,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
value,
the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The fair values may therefore be determined using model-based valuation techniques such as option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. 
The
Company applies the following fair value hierarchy to determine fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization
within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement Level1 inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level2 inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market
data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
Level3 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect the use of model-based valuation techniques and
management estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Fair
value was determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible impairment and if an
other-than-temporary impairment does exist, the charge would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company considers factors such as the length of time
an investment fair value has been below cost, the financial condition of the investee, and the Company ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for
anticipated recovery in market value. The Company evaluates whether an impairment of a debt security is other-than-temporary each reporting period using the following
guidance If management intends to sell an impaired debt security, the impairment is considered
other-than-temporary. If the entity does not intend to sell the impaired debt security, it must still assess whether it is
more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell the security. 
If management determines that it is more-likely-than-not that it will be required to
sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis of the security, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary. 
If management determines that it does not intend to sell an impaired debt security and that it is not
more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell such a security before recovery of the security amortized cost basis, the entity must assess whether it
expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. There
was no impairment charge for any of the years presented. The Company has the intent and ability to hold securities until their value recovers. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Billing Reserve 
The Company generally requires no collateral from customers; however, throughout the collection process, it conducts an ongoing
evaluation of its customers' ability to pay. The Company allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical trends, experience
and current market and industry conditions. Management regularly evaluates the adequacy of the Company allowance for doubtful 
58 
Table of Contents Keynote Systems,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
accounts
by considering the age of outstanding invoices, customers' ability to pay and the Company collection history with each customer. Management reviews customer invoices greater than
60days past due to determine whether a specific allowance is appropriate. In addition, the Company maintains a reserve for all other invoices that is calculated as a percentage of the
outstanding accounts receivable balance based on historical collection trends. In
addition to the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company maintains a billing reserve that represents a reserve for potential billing adjustments that will be recorded as a
reduction of revenue. The Company billing reserve is calculated as a percentage of revenue based on historical trends. 
The
allowance for doubtful accounts and billing reserve represent management best estimates as of each balance sheet date, however, changes in circumstances, including unforeseen
declines in market conditions, actual collection rates and the number of billing adjustments, may result in additional allowances or recoveries in the future. Inventories 
Inventories represent the material and labor costs for system hardware to be installed as part of a system license arrangement and are
stated at the lower of cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, a provision is made for the
difference between the cost and the market value. The Company evaluates inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis. This evaluation includes analysis of historical and
forecasted product sales. Obsolescence is determined considering several factors, including competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions, and product life cycles. Any adjustment for market
value decreases, inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand or obsolete inventories are charged to direct cost of revenuesystem licenses in the period in which any such adjustment
is identified. 
Property, Equipment and Software 
Property, equipment and software are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally between 30months and 60months. Leasehold and building improvements are
amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets, which ranges from five to thirty years, or the lease term. The cost of the Company headquarters building is being depreciated
over thirty years. 
Business Combinations 
The Company recognizes assets acquired including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed at fair value on
the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of such assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized in earnings, after the expiration of the measurement period, a period not to
exceed 12months from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related expenses and acquisition-related restructuring costs are recognized in earnings in the period in which they are incurred. 
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired
less liabilities assumed. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are 
59 
Table of Contents Keynote Systems,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued reviewed
annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are generally amortized on a
straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally three to eight years. 
The
Company tests for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. These tests are performed at the reporting unit level using a two-step, fair-value based approach. The
Company has determined that it has one reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. The
first step determines the fair value of the reporting unit using the market capitalization value and compares it to the reporting unit carrying value. The Company determines its
market capitalization value based on the number of shares outstanding, its average stock price and other relevant market factors, such as merger and acquisition multiples and control premiums. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step allocates the fair value of the
reporting unit to the Company tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. This derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. Based
on the results of the first step of the Company impairment test performed at September30, 2012, the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more
than 10% and the Company determined that its goodwill had not been impaired. The Company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in
determining fair value, including long-term revenue growth projections, discount rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company
market capitalization and general industry, market and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that changes in such circumstances, or in the variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and
estimates used in assessing the fair value of its reporting unit, would require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. The
Company assesses long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company
assesses the fair value of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flow that the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when such fair value plus net proceeds
expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When the Company identifies an impairment, it reduces the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated
fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. Revenue Recognition 
Subscriptions revenue consists primarily of revenue from the sale of products and services sold through a cloud-based model on a
subscription basis also referred to as Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS. Subscription arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take
possession of the software supporting the on-demand application service at any time. Subscription revenue consists
of Web Measurement Subscriptions which consists of Application Perspective, Transaction Perspective, Streaming Perspective and Web Site Perspective products and services, Other Subscriptions which
consists of all other Internet subscription product and services and Mobile Subscriptions which consists 
60 
Table of Contents Keynote Systems,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued  1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
of
GlobalRoamer, Mobile Device Perspective, Mobile Web Perspective, Test Center Enterprise TCE Interactive and Test Center Developer products and services. 
The
Company also sells monitoring systems to mobile network operators and monitoring and testing systems to enterprise mobile customers under licensing arrangements. Licensing
arrangements with mobile customers typically include software licenses, hardware, consulting services to configure the systems installation services, post contract support maintenance services,
training services and other consulting services associated with the Company System Integrated Test Environment SITE system, TCE Automation and TCE Monitoring products and services. Licensing
arrangements consist of Ratable Licenses which consists of SITE, TCE Automation and TCE Monitoring arrangements entered into prior to fiscal year 2011, Systems Licenses which consists of the
hardware and software elements of SITE, TCE Automation and TCE Monitoring arrangements and Maintenance and Support which consists of all other elements of SITE, TCE Automation and TCE Monitoring
arrangements, stand-alone mobile consulting services agreements and maintenance agreement renewals. 
The
Company supplements its cloud-based subscriptions and licensing arrangements with engagement services. Revenue
is recognized in accordance with appropriate accounting guidance when all of the following criteria have been met: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.The Company
considers a customer signed quote, contract, or purchase order to be evidence of an arrangement.  
Delivery of the product or service.Subscription based
services are considered delivered when the customer has been provided with access to the subscription services. Subscription services are generally delivered on a consistent basis over the period of
the subscription with the customer having flexibility to define and change measurements with respect to the type, frequency, location and complexity of each measurement. Engagement services are
considered delivered when the services are performed or the contractual milestones are completed. System licensing arrangements, excluding maintenance, are considered delivered when all elements of
the arrangement have either been delivered or accepted, if acceptance language exists.  
Fee is fixed or determinable.The Company considers the
fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and payment terms are standard.  
Collection is deemed reasonably assured.Collection is
deemed reasonably assured if it is expected that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due. If it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured,
then revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash collection. The
Company does not generally grant refunds. All discounts granted reduce revenue. Free trials are typically stand-alone transactions occasionally provided to prospective customers, for
which no revenue is recognized. 
Subscription
based services can either be billed in advance or in arrears. For customers that are billed in advance of providing measurements, revenue is deferred upon invoicing and is
recognized over the service period, generally ranging from one to twelve months, commencing on the day service is first provided. For customers that are billed in arrears, revenue is recognized based
upon actual usage of the 
61 
Table of Contents Keynote Systems,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
subscription
services and typically invoiced on a monthly basis. Regardless of when billing occurs, the Company recognizes revenue as services are provided and defers any revenue that is unearned. Revenue
associated with licensing system hardware, software essential to the functionality of the system essential software, installation services and training is deferred until the
later of delivery of the complete system or acceptance, in accordance with the arrangement contractual terms. Revenue associated with system maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the
maintenance term, usually one year. Non-essential software purchased by customers in bundled arrangements is deemed to be a software element that does not qualify for treatment as a
separate unit of accounting as the Company does not have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, typically maintenance.
Accordingly, non-essential software revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Engagements
revenue consists of fees generated from our professional consulting services and includes services such as Performance Insights, Customer Research Products and DemoAnywhere.
Revenue from these services is recognized as the services are performed, typically over a period of one to three months. For engagement service projects that contain project milestones, as defined in
the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenue based on input measures once the services or milestones have been delivered. 
Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables 
The Company enters into multiple element arrangements that generally consist of 1systems combined with maintenance,
installation and other consulting services, 2subscription services combined with engagement services, which include LoadPro and WebEffective, and 3multiple engagement services.  For Arrangements Entered into Prior to Adoption of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 prior to October1, 2010  Prior to the adoption of the amended accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, the Company was not able
to establish VSOE for all of the undelivered elements associated with SITE systems, primarily maintenance. Therefore, the Company recognized the entire arrangement fee into revenue ratably over the
maintenance period, historically ranging from twelve to thirty-six months, once the implementation and integration services are completed, usually within two to three months following the
delivery of the hardware and software. Ratable recognition of revenue began when evidence of customer acceptance of the software and hardware had occurred as intended under the respective
arrangement contractual terms. 
Ratable
licenses revenue consists of fees from the sale of mobile automated test equipment, related software and maintenance, and engineering and consulting services associated with SITE
systems. The
hardware component of a monitoring system arrangement is deemed to include an essential software related element. Customers do not purchase the hardware without also purchasing the software. None of
the SITE services are considered to be essential to the functionality of the licensed hardware and software products. This assessment is due to the implementation/integration services being performed
during a relatively short period compared to the length of the arrangement. Additionally, the implementation/integration services are general in nature and the Company has a history of successfully
gaining customer acceptance. SITE orders received prior to the beginning of fiscal year 2011 continue to be recognized ratably and are reported as Ratable license revenue.

Subscription
arrangements are treated as a single unit of accounting given that the elements within the subscription arrangements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of
accounting because sufficient objective evidence of fair value did not exist for the allocation of revenue. As a result the entire arrangement fee was recognized as revenue either ratably over the
service period, generally over twelve months, or based upon actual monthly usage.  For Arrangements Entered into Subsequent to Adoption of ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 subsequent to September30, 2010  Current accounting guidance for revenue recognition excludes tangible products containing software components and
non-software components that function together to deliver the product essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance. Accounting
guidance also requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using the relative fair value method based upon the best estimated selling prices BESP of each deliverable if a vendor does
not have VSOE or third-party-evidence TPE of selling price. 
The
Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it
has standalone value and there are no customer-negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered elements. Allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of
each unit relative selling price. 
When
applying the relative fair value method, the Company determines the selling price for each deliverable using its BESP, as the Company has determined it is unable to establish VSOE
or TPE of selling price for the deliverables. BESP reflects the Company best estimates of what the selling prices
of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company determines BESP for a deliverable by considering multiple factors including analyzing historical prices for
standalone and bundled arrangements against price lists, market conditions, competitive landscape and internal costs.  Effects of Adoption  The Company adopted the amended accounting guidance and prospectively applied its provisions to arrangements entered into or materially
modified on or after October1, 2010 the beginning of fiscal year 2011. The adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance had the primary effect of recognizing SITE systems revenue,
excluding maintenance, at the time of customer acceptance rather than ratably over the contract term. SITE orders received after September30, 2010 are reported as System licenses for the
hardware and software and as Maintenance and Support for the remaining elements. SITE orders received prior to the beginning of fiscal year 2011 continue to be recognized ratably and are reported as
Ratable license revenue because VSOE does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, typically maintenance. 
As
a result of adopting the new accounting guidance, the Company recognized $78million of net revenue and $07million of related direct costs of revenue for the year
ended September30, 2011, that would otherwise have been recognized in subsequent periods under the previous accounting guidance. If the new accounting guidance had not been adopted, the
Company would have reported $272million of ratable license revenue, no system license revenue, no maintenance and support revenue and net revenue of $952million for the year ended
September30, 2011. Revenue recognized related to multiple-element

arrangements
entered into prior to October1, 2010 was $143million for the year ended September30, 2011 and $35million for the year ended September30, 2012
see Note4. 
Direct Costs of Revenue and Deferred Revenue 
Direct Costs of RevenueSubscriptions and Services is comprised of
telecommunication and network fees for our measurement and data collection network,
costs for employees and consultants assigned to consulting engagements and to install monitoring and testing systems, depreciation of equipment related to our measurement and data collection network,
and costs of supplies. 
Direct Costs of RevenueSystem Licenses includes the material and labor costs of system hardware to be installed as part of a
system license arrangement. 
Deferred Revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected in advance and is recorded as deferred revenue on the
balance sheets until the revenue is earned. Any accounts receivable with associated deferred revenue reduces the balance of both accounts receivable and deferred revenue. Short-term
deferred revenue represents the unearned revenue that has been collected in advance that will be earned within twelve months of the balance sheet date. Correspondingly, long-term deferred
revenue represents the unearned revenue that will be earned after twelve months from the balance sheet date. 
Development 
Development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility, defined as a working prototype. The Company products and
service offerings have been available for general release shortly after the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, no development costs have been capitalized in fiscal years
ended September30, 2012, 2011 and 2010. 
Accounting
guidance for development costs incurred to develop internal use software requires companies to capitalize qualifying costs that are incurred during the application development
stage and amortize them over the software estimated useful life. There were no capitalized costs to develop internal use software for the years ended September30, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Advertising Costs 
All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses included in sales and marketing in the consolidated statements of
operations were $23million, $26million and $24million for the years ended September30, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 
Share-Based Compensation 
The Company issues stock-based compensation awards to employees, directors and contractors in the form of stock options, restricted
stock units RSUs and employee stock purchase plan ESPP awards, collectively awards. The
Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on the awards' fair value. Share-based compensation for RSUs is measured based on the value of
the Company common stock on the grant date, reduced by the present value of the dividend yield expected to be paid on the Company common stock. Share-based compensation for employee stock options
and ESPP awards are measured estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Awards
vest either on a graded schedule or in a lump sum. The Company determines the fair value of each award as a single award and recognizes the expense on a straight-line basis over the
service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period. The exercise price of stock options granted is equal to the fair market value of the Company common stock on the date of grant.
Stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Any incremental tax benefit on share-based awards is recognized as additional paid-in-capital in the
consolidated balance sheets when realized. 
The
Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods
to establish the beginning balance of additional paid-in-capital APIC pool related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation and to determine the subsequent
impact on the APIC pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding. The increase to the APIC pool is limited to the
tax benefits related to an employee award that is fully vested and outstanding. 
Income Taxes 
The provision for income taxes is accounted for under the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that the Company expects to realize. These calculations are performed on a separate tax jurisdiction
basis. 
The
Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest
benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. 
Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement 
The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-United States dollar functional currency subsidiaries into
United States dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Gains and losses from these translations
are credited or charged to foreign currency translation included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders' equity. The Company subsidiaries that use the United States dollar
as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, equipment, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at
historical rates. Gains and losses from these remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the Company results of operations.

1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Concentrations of Risk 
Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and accounts receivable. Credit risk is concentrated in North America and Europe, but also exists in other regions of the world such as Asia, the Middle East and
South America. 
No
customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenue for either of the years ended September30, 2012 or 2010. One customer accounted for 11% of net revenue for the year ended
September30, 2011. One customer accounted for 12% and 14% of the Company net accounts receivable as of September30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 
Recently Accounting Pronouncements 
In December 2011, FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU No2011-11, Balance Sheet
Topic 210Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ASU 2011-11, that requires entities to disclose additional information about
offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on the financial position. ASU 2011-11 will be effective for
the Company beginning October1, 2013. The adoption of ASU 2011-11 could impact future disclosures but would not impact the Company consolidated financial statements. 
In
September 2011, the FASB approved a revised accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. The amendment allows an entity to first assess
qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of
a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying
amount. The adoption of this accounting standard update in fiscal year 2012 did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In
June 2011, the FASB issued new accounting guidance, which eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders'
equity. Instead, an entity will be required to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. The standard is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011. We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. 
In
May 2011, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update, which amends the fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements. The most significant
change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for Level3 measurements based on unobservable inputs. The adoption of this accounting standard update in the second quarter of
fiscal year 2012 did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
2 Net Income Loss Per Share  Basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially
dilutive securities include 
66

2 Net Income Loss Per Share Continued 
outstanding
options, purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plan and unvested restricted stock units RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted
earnings per common share by application of the Treasury Stock Method. Under the Treasury Stock Method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company common stock can result in a greater
dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. 
The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share in thousands, except per share amounts: 
2012 
2011 
2010  Numerator Net income 4,708 50,862 1,686 Denominator Weighted average shares outstanding 17,504 16,096 14,708 Effect of dilutive securities 919 1,404 261 Weighted average sharesdiluted 18,423 17,500 14,969 Net Income per share Basic 027 316 011 Diluted 026 291 011 
Potentially
dilutive securities representing 03million, 00million, and 40million shares of common stock for the years ended September30, 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share because their effect would be antidilutive.  3 Business Combination  On October18, 2011, the Company acquired Mobile Complete,Inc., doing business as DeviceAnywhere DeviceAnywhere. DeviceAnywhere developed an enterprise-class,
cloud-based mobile application lifecycle management testing and quality assurance platform. DeviceAnywhere products and services complement and expand the Company market for testing and monitoring
the functionality, usability, performance and availability of mobile applications and mobile Web sites. The estimated acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred, assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are presented below and represent our best estimates. Fair Value of Consideration Transferred 
Pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company made cash payments totaling $600million for all of the outstanding securities of
DeviceAnywhere on October18, 2011. Under the terms of the merger agreement, the former stockholders of DeviceAnywhere potentially could have received additional payments acquisition-related
contingent consideration totaling up to $300million in cash. The 2011 earnout of up to $150million in cash was based on achievement of certain DeviceAnywhere revenue and EBITDA
targets for the period from January1, 2011 through December31, 2011. The 2012 earnout of up to $150million in cash required achievement of 1certain booking targets
for the period from September1, 2011 through December31, 2011 and 2revenue and
EBITDA targets for the period from January1, 2012 through December31, 2012. The 2011 earnout and the 2012 earnout collectively represent the acquisition-related contingent
consideration. The fair value of the acquisition-related contingent 
67  Table of Contents Keynote Systems,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
3 Business Combination Continued 
consideration
was based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represented a level3 measurement. Level3 instruments are valued based on unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and reflect the Company own assumptions to estimate fair value. In
preparing the preliminary purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date, management estimated the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the
estimated level of achievement of the 2011 earnout and 2012 earnout. As a result, a $20million liability was recorded at the acquisition date for the fair value of the acquisition-related
contingent consideration. Any change in the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date, including changes from events after the acquisition date,
such as changes in the estimate of revenues and EBITDA that are expected to be achieved, are recognized in earnings in the period the estimated fair value changes. In the quarter ended
December31, 2011, the Company concluded that the targets for both the 2011 earnout and the 2012 earnout would not be met and the former stockholders of DeviceAnywhere would not receive any
acquisition-related contingent consideration. Accordingly, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, the Company reversed the previously estimated liability and recorded a $20million
benefit in its operating results due to the change in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration. 
The
total acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred was $600million, inclusive of $60million in cash allocated to an escrow fund to satisfy
indemnification obligations pursuant to the merger agreement and the settlement of various debt and transaction related liabilities of DeviceAnywhere totaling $45million. 
Allocation of Consideration Transferred 
The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized and measured as of the acquisition date based on their
estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. The
following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed based on the purchase price allocation in thousands: 
Accounts receivable 2,758 Other assets, including deferred tax assets 1,009 Fixed assets 1,208 Identifiable intangible assets 13,170 Total identifiable assets acquired 18,145 Accounts payable and other liabilities 2,334 Contingent consideration 2,000 Deferred revenue 3,126 Total liabilities assumed 7,460 Net identifiable assets acquired 10,685 Goodwill 49,315 Amount paid 60,000 
68

3 Business Combination Continued 
Identifiable Intangible Assets 
Management engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets.
In determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets, the Company considered, among other factors, the best use of acquired assets, analyses of historical financial performance and
estimates of future performance of DeviceAnywhere products. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets were calculated considering market participant expectations and using an income
approach. The rates utilized to discount estimated net cash flows to their present values were based on a weighted average cost of capital of 125%. This discount rate was determined after
consideration of the rate of return on debt capital and equity that typical investors would require from an investment in companies similar in size and operating in similar markets as DeviceAnywhere.
The following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets associated with the DeviceAnywhere acquisition, as of the acquisition date, and their estimated useful lives in
thousands, except useful life: 
Useful life Years 
Fair Value  Technology 3-6 6,470 Backlog 1 2,700 Customer relationships 6 2,600 Trademarks 8 1,100 Non-compete agreements 3 300 Total identifiable intangible assets 13,170 
The
Company determined the useful lives of the identifiable intangible assets based on the expected future cash flows associated with the respective asset. Technology is comprised of
products that have reached technological feasibility and are part of DeviceAnywhere product line. There were no in-process research and development assets as of the acquisition date.
Backlog represents the fair value of firm orders for products and services to be delivered to customers. Customer relationships represent the underlying relationships and agreements with
DeviceAnywhere installed customer base. Trademarks represent the fair value of the brand and name recognition associated with the marketing of DeviceAnywhere products and services. Noncompete
agreements represent the fair value of employee knowledge in the development of products and services. Amortization expense for technology is included in costs of revenue, and amortization expense for
backlog, customer relationships, trademarks, and noncompete agreements are included in operating expenses. 
Deferred Revenue 
In connection with the allocation of consideration transferred, the Company estimated the fair value of the service obligations assumed
from DeviceAnywhere as a consequence of the acquisition. The estimated fair value of the service obligations was determined using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up
approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the amount
that the Company would be required to pay a third party to assume the service obligations. The estimated costs to fulfill the service obligations were based on the historical direct costs engaged in
providing service and support activities. The estimated research and development costs associated with support contracts have not been included in the fair value determination, as these costs were not
deemed to represent a legal 
69 
Table of Contents Keynote Systems,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued  3 Business Combination Continued 
obligation
at the time of acquisition. Based on this approach, the Company recorded approximately $31million of deferred revenue to reflect the estimate of the fair value of DeviceAnywhere
service obligations assumed. 
Results of Operations  The amount of net revenue and net loss of DeviceAnywhere included in the Company consolidated statements of operations were as
follows during the fiscal year in thousands: 
2012  Net revenue 16,489 Net loss 6,871 
Included
in the net loss of DeviceAnywhere for the year ended September30, 2012 is $44million of amortization of identifiable intangibles, $09million of
stock-based compensation and $03million of transaction and integration expenses. The $20million one-time benefit from reversing the previously estimated contingent
consideration liability in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 is excluded from net loss above. Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information 
The following table presents the Company pro forma results as if the DeviceAnywhere acquisition had occurred as of the first day of
each period presented. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had

for issuance under the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan Incentive Plan and approved an extension of its term until December31, 2015. As of September30, 2012, the Company was authorized
to issue up to approximately 38million shares of common stock under its Incentive Plan. Vesting periods are determined by the Board of Directors and generally, in the case of stock options,
provide for shares to vest over a period of four years with 25% of the shares vesting one year from the date of grant and the remainder vesting monthly over the next three years. RSUs generally vest
in full either three years or four years from the date of grant. Options expire ten years after the date of grant. Approximately 14million shares were available for future grants under the
Incentive Plan as of September30, 2012. 
Under
the Incentive Plan, the exercise price for incentive stock options must be at least 100% of the common stock fair market value on the date of grant for employees owning less than
10% of the voting power of all classes of stock, and at least 110% of the common stock fair market value on the date of grant for employees owning more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of
stock. For nonqualified stock options, the exercise price must be at least 110% of the common stock fair market value on the date of grant for employees owning more than 10% of the voting power of
all classes of stock and no less than 85% of the stock fair market value on the date of grant for employees owning less than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock. 
1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In September 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan, which will expire on June28,
2019. As of September30, 2012, the Company had reserved a total of approximately 03million shares of common stock for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. Under the Purchase Plan,
eligible employees may defer an amount not to exceed 10% of the employee compensation, as defined in the Purchase Plan, to purchase common stock of the Company. The purchase price per share is 85%
of the lesser of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the

applicable
offering period or the last day of each purchase period. The Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Restricted Stock Units 
Stock-based compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the value of the Company stock on the grant date, reduced by the present
value of the dividend yield expected to be paid on the Company common stock. Upon vesting, the RSUs are generally net share-settled to cover the required withholding tax and the remaining amount is
converted into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. 
Recipients
of RSU awards generally must remain employed by the Company on a continuous basis through the end of the applicable performance period in order to receive any portion of the
shares subject to that award. RSUs do not have dividend equivalent rights and do not have the voting rights of common stock until earned and issued following the end of the applicable performance
period. The expense for these awards, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period based on the number of awards that are expected to be earned. The
fair value of each RSU was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to reflect the impact of dividends on the fair value of each RSU granted.
Weighted-average assumptions for RSUs granted under the Incentive Plan during the fiscal years were as follows:

Stockholder Rights Plan 
On October28, 2002, the Company announced that its Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan. The plan was amended
on December15, 2003. The plan is designed to protect the long-term value of the Company for its stockholders during any future unsolicited acquisition attempt. The rights become
exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the plan, including the acquisition of 20% of the Company outstanding common stock by a person or group. The Company Board of
Directors adopted a policy under which a committee consisting solely of independent directors of the Board will review the Rights Agreement at least once every three years to consider whether
maintaining the Rights Agreement continues to be in the best interests of Keynote and its stockholders. The Board may amend the terms of the rights without the approval of the holders of the rights.

11 Comprehensive Income Loss and Foreign Currency Translation  Comprehensive income loss consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that are
recorded as an element of stockholders' equity rather than in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company other comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation adjustments
related to those subsidiaries not using the United States Dollar as their functional currency and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale. 
The
components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the balance sheets are as follows in thousands: 
September30, 2012 
2011  Net unrealized gain loss on available-for-sale investments 6 131 Cumulative foreign currency translation gain loss 1,063 1,314 Accumulated other comprehensive income loss 1,057 1,183 
The
Company did not record deferred taxes on unrealized losses on its investments due to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for capital losses in the United States. There is
no tax effect on the foreign currency translation because it is management intent to reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries indefinitely. 
Gains
losses from foreign currency transactions are reflected in other income expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred and were $00million 03 million and $01 million for the years ended September30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively 
12 Excess Occupancy Income  Excess occupancy income consists of rental income from the leasing of space not occupied by the Company in its headquarters building, net of related fixed costs, which consists of
property taxes, insurance, building depreciation, leasing broker fees and tenant improvement amortization. Property taxes, insurance and building depreciation are based upon actual square footage
available to lease to third parties, which was approximately 75% prior to January1, 2012 and 65% subsequent to that date. Rental income was $32million, $26million, and
$30million for the years ended September30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of September30, 2012, the Company had leased space to 16 tenants, of which 15 had
non-cancellable operating leases, which expire on various dates through 2018. At September30, 2012, future minimum rents receivable under the leases were as follows in thousands:

tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the Company deferred taxes are as follows in thousands:

Management
has established a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets for which it is not more-likely-than-not to be realized. The
net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended September30, 2012 and 2011 was a decrease of $70 million and $434 million, respectively. 
The
Company accounting for deferred taxes involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of the Company deferred tax assets. Assessing the realizability
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon several factors, including the likelihood and amount, if any, of future taxable income in relevant jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary
differences become deductible. The Company forecasts taxable income by considering all available positive and negative evidence including its history of operating income or losses and its financial
plans and estimates which are used to manage the business. These assumptions require significant judgment about future taxable income. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is
subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. 
In
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company determined, based on its recent history of earnings coupled with its forecasted profitability, that it is
more-likely-than-not that $415million of deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future and a valuation allowance should be maintained
against the remaining deferred tax assets. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company released $373million of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets,
primarily related to its federal deferred tax assets. The Company remaining deferred tax assets subject to valuation

allowance
because management does not believe that it is more-likely-than-not that they will be realized primarily consist of foreign net operating losses in
certain jurisdictions, net operating losses resulting from windfall stock option deductions which when realized will be credited to additional paid in capital and certain state deferred tax assets. 
Any
subsequent increases in the valuation allowance will be recognized as an increase in deferred tax expense. Any decreases in the valuation allowance will be recorded either as a
reduction of the income tax provision or as a credit to paid-in-capital if the associated deferred tax asset relates to windfall stock option deductions. 
At
September30, 2012, deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for approximately $86million of undistributed earnings of the Company foreign subsidiaries as
it is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings. It is management intention to reinvest such undistributed earnings indefinitely in its foreign
subsidiaries. In connection with the merger of the Company United Kingdom subsidiary into the Company Netherlands subsidiary in fiscal year 2011, the United Kingdom subsidiary declared a dividend
to the parent in the amount of the excess cash held by the subsidiary at the date of its dissolution. As of September30, 2011, a deferred tax liability was provided for the undistributed
earnings associated with the dividend from the Company foreign subsidiary in the United Kingdom. The dividend was paid during the year ended September30, 2012. If the Company distributes the
remaining undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, in the form of dividends or otherwise, it would be subject to both United States income taxes net of applicable foreign tax credits and
withholding taxes payable to the foreign jurisdiction. 
The
Company had net operating loss carryforwards as of September30, 2012 for federal income tax purposes of $704million, available to reduce future income subject to
income taxes. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, in tax years 2017 through 2030. In addition, the Company had $392million of net operating loss
carryforwards as of September30, 2012 available to reduce future taxable income for state income tax purposes. The state net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, in tax
years 2012 through 2030. As of September30, 2012, federal and state
net operating loss carryforwards of $255million and $101million, respectively, resulted from exercises of employee stock options, for which the related deferred tax asset has a full
valuation allowance recorded against it on the Company consolidated balance sheet. When realized, the benefit of the tax deduction related to these options will be accounted for as a credit to
stockholders' equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision. 
As
of September30, 2012, the Company had research credit carryforwards of $38million for federal and $49million for state income tax purposes, individually
available to reduce future income taxes. The federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in tax year 2019. The California research credit carryforwards do not expire. As of
September30, 2012, state research credit carryforwards of $06million resulted from exercises of employee stock options and were not recorded on the Company consolidated balance
sheet. When realized, the benefit of the tax deduction related to these options will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders' equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision. 
Federal
and state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes, as
defined in Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has determined that the net operating losses and research and development credits acquired through the acquisition of three of
its subsidiaries are subject to Section382 limitations, and the effects of the limitations have been reflected in the loss and credit carryforwards. If an 
85 
Table of Contents Keynote Systems,Inc. and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
13 Income Taxes Continued 
additional
ownership change occurs, the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced. 
In
December 2007, the Company entered into an agreement whereby it purchased certain intangible assets from its German subsidiary. This transaction was treated as an intercompany sale
and, as such, tax is not recognized on the sale until the Company no longer benefits from the underlying asset. Accordingly, the Company recorded a long-term prepaid tax asset that was
amortized through tax expense over the estimated life of the underlying asset. Amortization expense on the prepaid tax asset was $01million, $08million and $08million for
the years ended September30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of September30, 2012, the prepaid tax asset is fully amortized. 
The
Company has unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax
benefits during the fiscal years were as follows in thousands: 
September30, 2010 balance 7,023 Increases related to prior year tax positions 1,402 Decreases related to prior year tax positions 626 Increases related to current year tax positions 137 September30, 2011 balance 7,936 Increases related to prior year tax positions 563 Decreases related to prior year tax positions 182 Decreases related to lapse of statute of limitations 91 Increases related to current year tax positions 103 September30, 2012 balance 8,329 
If
the ending balance of approximately $83million of unrecognized tax benefits at September30, 2012 were recognized, $67million would affect the effective
income tax rate. In accordance with the Company accounting policy, it recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. The Company
had accrued interest and penalties of $07million at September30, 2012. The
Company 2006 through 2009 German income tax returns are being audited by the German tax authorities. The Company believes it has made adequate tax payments and accrued adequate
amounts such that the outcome of this audit will have no material adverse effects on its results of operations or financial condition. 
It
is possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including the unrecognized tax benefits related to the audit in Germany, may change within the next
12months. However, an estimate of the range of possible changes cannot be made at this time. In addition, over the next twelve months, the Company existing tax positions will continue to
generate an increase in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.

Commitments 
As of September30, 2012, the Company had $17million of contingent commitments to bandwidth and co-location
providers. These contingent commitments have a remaining term ranging from one to twenty-seven months and become due if the Company terminates any of these agreements prior to their expiration. As
of September30, 2012, the Company, through one of its foreign subsidiaries, had outstanding guarantees totaling $03million to customers and vendors as a form of
security. The guarantees can only be executed upon agreement by both the customer or vendor and the Company. The guarantees are secured by an unsecured line of credit in the amount of
$13million. 
Legal Proceedings 
The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of
these matters is currently not determinable, management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these mattersconsisting of the fees and costs that are required for a

litigation
matter from its commencement to final disposition or settlementwill have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows. No amount has been accrued as of September30, 2012 since management believes that the Company liability, if any, is not probable and cannot be reasonably estimated. Warranties 
The Company products are generally warranted to perform for a period of one year. In the event there is a failure of such products,
the Company generally is obliged to correct or replace the product. No amount has been accrued for warranty obligations as of September30, 2012 or 2011, as costs to replace or correct are
generally reimbursable under the manufacturer warranty. 
Indemnification 
The Company does not generally indemnify its customers against legal claims that its services infringe third-party intellectual
property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions that could subject the Company to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third party. However, the Company has never been a party to an infringement claim and its management is not aware of any liability related to any infringement
claims subject to indemnification. As such, no amount is accrued for infringement claims as of September30, 2012.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Keynote Systems,Inc.
San Mateo, California 
We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Keynote Systems,Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of September30, 2012, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As
described in Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Mobile
CompleteInc., doing business as DeviceAnywhere DeviceAnywhere, which was acquired on October18, 2011 and whose financial statements constitute 13% of the Company consolidated
revenue for the year ended September30, 2012. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at DeviceAnywhere. The Company management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2012, based on the criteria established
in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
