32 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of WESCO International, Inc. We have completed integrated audits of WESCO International, Inc.s 2005 and 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005
and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of WESCO International,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under a2
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 33 Table of Contents As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has
excluded Carlton-Bates Company and Fastec Industrial Corp. from its assessment of internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 because they were acquired by the Company in
purchase business combinations during 2005. We have also excluded Carlton-Bates Company and Fastec
Industrial Corp. from our audit of internal controls over financial
reporting. Carlton-Bates
Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total
revenues represent $2917 million and $768 million,
respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
December31, 2005. Fastec Industrial Corp. is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and
total revenues represent $448 million and $277 million, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement
amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2005. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. 38 Table of Contents WESCO INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION WESCO International, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively, WESCO, headquartered in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a full-line distributor of electrical supplies and equipment and is a
provider of integrated supply procurement services with operations in the United States, Canada,
Mexico, Puerto Rico, Guam, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, United Arab Emirates and Singapore. WESCO
currently operates approximately 370 branch locations and eight distribution centers six in the
United States and two in Canada. 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of WESCO International, Inc. and
all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
disclosures. Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current events
and actions WESCO may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from the
estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized for product sales when title, ownership and risk of loss pass to the
customer, or for services when the service is rendered or evidence of a customer arrangement
exists. In the case of stock sales and special orders, a sale occurs at the time of shipment from
our distribution point, as the terms of WESCOs sales are FOB shipping point. In cases where we
process customer orders but ship directly from our suppliers, revenue is recognized once product is
shipped and title has passed. For some of our customers, we provide services such as inventory
management or other specific support. Revenues are recognized upon evidence of fulfillment of the
agreed upon services. In all cases, revenue is recognized once the sales price to our customer is
fixed or is determinable and WESCO has reasonable assurance as to the collectibility in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin No104. Gross Profit Our calculation of gross profit is net sales less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold
includes our cost of the products sold and excludes cost for selling, general and administrative
expenses and depreciation and amortization, which are reported separately in the statement of
income. Supplier Volume Rebates WESCO receives rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with such
suppliers. An asset, included within other accounts receivable on the balance sheet, represents
the estimated amounts due to WESCO under the rebate provisions of such contracts. The
corresponding rebate income is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold. The appropriate
level of such income is derived from the level of actual purchases made by WESCO from suppliers, in
accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No02-16, Accounting
by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor. Receivables under the supplier rebate
program are within other accounts receivable and were $306million at December31, 2005 and $268
million at December31, 2004. The total amount recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold was
$472million, $445million and $293million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 39 Table of Contents Shipping and Handling Costs and Fees WESCO records the majority of costs and fees associated with transporting its products to
customers as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs totaled
$445million, $366million and $362million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The remaining shipping and handling costs relate to costs that are billed to our customers.
These costs and the related revenue are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of
operations. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are defined as highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90days
or less when purchased. As of December31, 2005, cash and cash equivalents were $221million, a
decrease of $124million from December31, 2004. Asset Securitization WESCO accounts for the securitization of accounts receivable in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. At the time the receivables are sold, the
balances are removed from the balance sheet. SFAS No140 also requires retained interests in the
transferred assets to be measured by allocating the previous carrying amount between the assets
sold and retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer. WESCO
estimates fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risks involved. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts WESCO maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. WESCO has a systematic procedure using
estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectibility made at the local
branch level and on a consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful
accounts. If the financial condition of WESCOs customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The allowance
for doubtful accounts was $126million at December31, 2005 and $125million at December31,
2004, respectively. The total amount recorded as selling, general and administrative expense
related to bad debts was $86million, $58million and $102million for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Inventories Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are stated at the lower
of cost or market. Cost is determined principally under the average cost method. WESCO makes
provisions for obsolete or slow-moving inventories as necessary to reflect reduction in inventory
value. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were $125million and $101million at
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total expense related to excess and obsolete
inventories, included in cost of goods sold, was $41million, $55million and $50million for
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. WESCO absorbs into the cost of inventory the general and
administrative expenses related to inventory such as purchasing, receiving and storage and at
December31, 2005 and 2004 $302million and $271, respectively, of these costs were included in
the ending inventory. Other Assets WESCO amortizes deferred financing fees over the term of the various debt instruments.
Deferred financing fees in the amount of $96million related to
new and amended financing was incurred during
the year ending December31, 2005. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the amount of other assets
related to unamortized deferred financing fees was $127million and $46million, respectively. Property, Buildings and Equipment Property, buildings and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is determined
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over either their respective lease terms or their estimated lives,
whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives range from five to forty years for buildings and
leasehold improvements and three to seven years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. 40 Table of Contents Computer software is accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Capitalized computer
software costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life,
typically two to five years, and are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable
value. Expenditures for new facilities and improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are
capitalized. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property is retired
or otherwise disposed of, the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any related gains or losses are recorded and reported as selling, general and
administrative expenses. The Company assesses its long-lived assets for impairment by reviewing periodically the
Companys operating performance by branch and respective utilization of real and tangible assets at
such sites; by evaluating utilization of computer hardware and software, which is amortized over 3
to 5years; utilization and serviceability of all other assets; and by comparing fair values of
real properties against market values of similar properties. Upon closure of any branch, asset
usefulness and remaining life are evaluated and any charges taken as appropriate. Of our $1031
million net book value of long-lived assets as of December31,
2005, of which $71million was the net book value of assets
acquired through acquisitions in 2005, $646
million consists of land, buildings and leasehold improvements and are geographically dispersed
among our 370 branches and eight distribution centers, mitigating the risk of impairment.
Approximately $19million of assets consist of computer equipment and capitalized software and are
evaluated for use and serviceability relative to carrying value. The remaining fixed assets,
mainly of furniture and fixtures, warehousing equipment and transportation equipment, are similarly
evaluated for serviceability and use. As of December31,2005 the net book value of long-lived
assets was estimated to approximate the fair value of fixed assets. Goodwill Effective January1, 2002, WESCO adopted SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Under SFAS No142, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is reduced if impaired. Goodwill is
tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or
circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. This process involves estimating
fair value using discounted cash flow analyses. Considerable management judgment is necessary to
estimate discounted future cash flows. Assumptions used for these estimated cash flows were based
on a combination of historical results and current internal forecasts. Two primary assumptions
were an average long-term revenue growth rate of between 3% and 13% and a discount rate of 8%.
Goodwill totaled $5422million at December31, 2005 and $4016million at December31, 2004. Intangible Assets Intangible
assets are capitalized and amortized over 5 to 19years when the life is
determinable. For intangible assets that have an indefinite life, no amortization is recorded.
Intangible assets related to customer relationships are amortized using an accelerated method
whereas all other intangible assets subject to amortization use a straight-line method which
reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the respective assets are consumed or
otherwise used. Intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events
of circumstances occur indicating that the respective asset might be impaired. Insurance Programs WESCO uses commercial insurance for auto, workers compensation, casualty and health claims as
a risk-reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses. Our strategy involves large deductibles
where WESCO must pay all costs up to the deductible amount. WESCO estimates our reserve based on
historical incident rates and costs. The assumptions included in developing this accrual include
the period of time from incurrence of a medical claim until the claim is paid by the insurance
provider. Presently, this period is estimated to be eight weeks. The total liability related to
the insurance programs was $75million at December31, 2005 and $67million at December31, 2004. 41 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of
assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates
and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation
allowances, if any, are provided when a portion or all of a deferred tax asset may not be realized.
WESCO reviews uncertain tax positions and assesses the need and amount of contingency reserves
necessary to cover any probable audit adjustments. Foreign Currency The local currency is the functional currency for all of WESCOs operations outside the United
States. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange
rate in effect at the end of each period. Income statement accounts are translated at the average
exchange rate prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of
differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of other comprehensive
income within stockholders equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are
included in net income for the period. Treasury Stock Common stock purchased for treasury is recorded at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue,
the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock, with cost determined on a weighted
average basis. Stock-Based Compensation During the year ended December31, 2003, WESCO adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This change in accounting method was applied on a
prospective basis in accordance with SFAS No148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation 
Transition and Disclosure an amendment of SFAS No123. Stock options awarded prior to 2003 are
accounted for under the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. WESCO recognized $86million and $29million of
compensation expense related to equity awards in the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The following table presents the pro forma results as if the fair-value-based method of

42 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, a revolving line of credit, a mortgage financing
facility, notes payable, debentures and other long-term debt. The Companys 2017 Notes and
Debentures have a fair value in excess of carrying value based upon market price quotes for these
instruments including at December31, 2005. The carrying value of our mortgage facility and other
long-term debt are considered to approximate fair value, based upon market comparisons available
for instruments with similar terms and maturities. For all remaining WESCO financial instruments,
carrying values are considered to approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Environmental Expenditures WESCO has facilities and operations that distribute certain products that must comply with
environmental regulations and laws. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or
capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past
operations, and that do not contribute to future revenue, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded
when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which changes the
requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No154
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an
accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions. SFAS No154
eliminates the requirement to include the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in
the income statement and instead requires that changes in accounting principle be retroactively
applied. A change in accounting estimate continues to be accounted for in the period of change and
future periods if necessary. A correction of an error continues to be reported by restating prior
period financial statements. SFAS No154 is effective for WESCO for accounting changes and
correction of errors made on or after January1, 2006. In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123R, Share Based Payment. This statement is a
revision of SFAS Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance.
SFAS No123R addresses all forms of share-based payment SBP awards, including shares issued
under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights.
Under SFAS No123R, SBP awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards
grant date, based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest and will be reflected
as compensation expense in the financial statements. In addition, this statement will apply to
unvested options granted prior to the effective date. In March2005, the SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No107 regarding the SEC Staffs interpretation of SFAS No123R and provides
the Staffs view regarding interaction between SFAS No123R and certain SEC rules and regulations
and provides interpretation of the valuation of SBP for public companies. In April2005, the SEC
approved a rule that delays the effective date of SFAS No123R for annual, rather than interim,
reporting periods that begin after June15, 2005. In
January2006, the FASB approved the release of
FASB Staff Position FSP FAS No123 R-4, Clarification of Options and Similar Instruments
Issued as Employee Compensation That Allow for Cash Settlement Upon the Occurrence of a Contingent
Event. The FSP addresses certain contingencies we might have incurred related to our stock option
plans. We will adopt SFAS No123R utilizing a modified prospective method and beginning with the 2006
first quarter reporting period ending March31, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No123R and the
subsequently issued FSP will not produce a material impact on the Companys financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs an amendment of Accounting
Research Bulletin ARB No43, Chapter4. This Statement amends the guidance in ARB No43,
Chapter4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for normal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material spoilage. This statement becomes effective
for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. This statement will not have a material effect on
our financial statements. In May2004, the FASB issued FSP No.FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the
Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 FSP 109-2
which provides guidance under SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, with respect to recording
the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the
Jobs Act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was
enacted on October22, 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the
financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for
reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of
applying SFAS No109. In 2005, we elected to repatriate
earnings of approximately $230
million under the provisions of the Jobs Act, incurring only a $10million income tax charge 43 Table of Contents 3. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill During the fourth quarter of 2005, WESCO completed its annual impairment review required by
SFAS No142. Each of WESCOs seven reporting units was tested for impairment by comparing the
implied fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value using discounted cash flow
analyses. Assumptions used for these estimated cash flows were based on a combination of
historical results and current internal forecasts. No impairment losses were identified as a
result of this review. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows

44 Table of Contents 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY WESCO maintains
a Receivables Facility that had a total purchase commitment of $400million
as of December31, 2005. The Receivables Facility has a term of three years and is subject to
renewal in May2008. Under the Receivables Facility, WESCO sells, on a continuous basis, an
undivided interest in all domestic accounts receivable to WESCO Receivables Corporation, a wholly
owned, special-purpose entity SPE. The SPE sells, without recourse, to a third-party conduit
all the eligible receivables while maintaining a subordinated interest, in the form of over
collateralization, in a portion of the receivables. WESCO has agreed to continue servicing the
sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates; accordingly, no servicing asset or
liability has been recorded. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable eligible for securitization totaled
approximately $525million and $420million, respectively, of which the subordinated retained
interest was approximately $128million and $212million, respectively. Accordingly, $3970
million and $2080million of accounts receivable balances were removed from the consolidated
balance sheets at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Costs associated with the Receivables
Facility totaled $133million, $66million and $45million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
These amounts are recorded as other expenses in the consolidated statements of income and are
primarily related to the discount and loss on the sale of accounts receivables, partially offset by
related servicing revenue. The key economic assumptions used to measure the retained interest at the date of the
securitization completed in 2005 were a discount rate of 35% and an estimated life of 15months. 5. ACQUISITIONS The following table sets forth the consideration paid for acquisitions

with SFAS No141, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated based
on an independent appraisal of the fair value of intangible assets and managements estimate of the
fair value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the excess being
recorded primarily as goodwill as of the effective date of the acquisition. 45 Table of Contents The preliminary allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the 2005

Acquisition of Carlton-Bates Company On September29, 2005, WESCO acquired Carlton-Bates Company Carlton-Bates, headquartered
in Little Rock, Arkansas. The purchase price was $2485million, net of $18million cash
acquired, of which $250million of the purchase price was held in escrow to address up to $50
million of post-closing adjustments relating to working capital and up to $200million of
potential indemnification claims, with all distributions from the escrow to be made by March2008.
Distributions of $20million and $30million were made from the escrow in November2005 and
February2006, respectively in accordance with terms set forth in the purchase agreement. Carlton-Bates operates two business divisions: 1a traditional branch-based distributor and
2the LADD division, the sole U.S. distributor of engineered connecting devices for the
industrial products division of Deutsch Company ECD. Carlton-Bates is a regional distributor of
electrical and electronic components with a special emphasis on automation and electromechanical
applications and the original equipment manufacturer markets. Carlton-Bates also adds new product
categories, new supplier relationships, kitting and light assembly services, and provides
opportunities to penetrate further into specialty products and value-added services. The purchase price allocation resulted in intangible assets of $744million and goodwill of
$1296million, of which $559million is deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets
include customer relationships of $453million amortized over a range of 13 to 19years,
trademarks of $169million and distribution agreements of $120million and non-compete agreements
of $02million, both of which are amortized over five years. Trademarks have an indefinite life
and are not being amortized. The intangible assets were valued by American Appraisal Associates,
Inc., an independent appraiser. No residual value is estimated for these intangible assets. The operating results of Carlton-Bates have been included in WESCOs consolidated financial
statements since September29, 2005. Un-audited pro forma results of operations in thousands,
except per share data for the twelve months ended December31, 2005 and 2004 are included below as
if the acquisition occurred on the first day of the respective periods. This summary of the
un-audited pro forma results of operations is not necessarily indicative of what WESCOs
results of operations would have been had Carlton-Bates been acquired at the beginning of 2004, nor
does it purport to represent results of operations for any future periods. Seasonality of sales is
not a significant factor to these pro forma combined results of operations.

46 Table of Contents Acquisition of Fastec Industrial Corp. On July29, 2005, WESCO acquired the assets and business of Fastec Industrial Corp.
Fastec. Fastec is a nationwide importer and distributor of industrial fasteners, cabinet and
locking and latching products. WESCO paid $287million, net of $03million cash acquired, and
issued a $30million promissory note to consummate this acquisition. In
accordance with the terms of the purchase, a net working capital valuation was performed subsequent
to the closing date of the acquisition resulting in an increase to the purchase price and the note
payable in the amount of $03million. The purchase price allocation resulted in intangible assets of $111million and goodwill of
$54million, which is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets
include customer relationships of $94million, trademarks of $15million and non-compete
agreements of $02million. Trademarks have an indefinite life and are not being amortized.
Non-compete agreements are being amortized over 5years and customer relationships over 15years.
The intangible assets were valued by American Appraisal Associates, Inc., an independent appraiser.
No residual value is estimated for the intangible assets. The operating results of Fastec have been included in WESCOs operating results since July29,
2005. Pro forma comparative results of WESCO, assuming the acquisition of Fastec had been made at
the beginning of fiscal 2004, would not have been materially different from the reported results or
the pro forma results presented above. Acquisition of Bruckner Supply Company, Inc. In 1998, WESCO acquired substantially all the assets and assumed substantially all liabilities
and obligations relating to the operations of Bruckner Supply Company, Inc. Bruckner. The terms
of the purchase agreement provide for additional contingent consideration to be paid based on
achieving certain earnings targets. The amount of earnout proceeds payable in any single year
subsequent to achieving the earnings target is capped under this agreement at $30million per year.
As a result of Bruckners performance in 2003, WESCO recorded a liability of $80million as of
December31, 2003 for contingent consideration relating to the Bruckner agreement. In June2004,
WESCO paid $30million pursuant to this agreement, and the remaining $50million, including
interest at a fixed rate of 10% due under the agreement, was converted into a note payable. In June
2005 WESCO paid $30million pursuant to the note, and the remaining payment of $20million under
this note is due June2006. No additional amounts can be earned under this agreement. Other Acquisition Another acquisition agreement contains contingent consideration for the final acquisition
payment which management has estimated will be $50million and paid between 2006 and 2008 and is
reported as deferred acquisition payable. A net payment of $20million $30million mandatory
payment reduced for acquisition related expenses of $10million was paid in the fourth quarter
of 2004 related to this acquisition. 6. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND SIGNIFICANT SUPPLIERS WESCO distributes its products and services and extends credit to a large number of customers
in the industrial, construction, utility and manufactured structures markets. In addition, WESCOs
largest supplier accounted for approximately 12%, 12% and 13% of WESCOs purchases for each of the
three years, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and therefore, WESCO could potentially incur risk
due to supplier concentration. Based upon WESCOs broad customer base, the Company has concluded
that it has no credit risk due to customer concentration. 7. PROPERTY, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT The following table sets forth the components of property, buildings and equipment

Net of original issue discount of $4,934 and purchase discount of $3,914 in 2004, and
interest rate swaps of $2,669 in 2004. Revolving Credit Facility In March2002, WESCO entered into a revolving credit agreement Revolving Credit Facility
that is collateralized by substantially all personal property owned by WESCO Distribution and its
subsidiaries. In 2005, WESCO amended and restated the revolving credit agreement to, among other
things, amend the maturity date to June2010 and to create two separate sub-facilities: ia U.S.
sub-facility with a borrowing limit of up to $225million and iia Canadian sub-facility with a
borrowing limit of up to $50million. Availability under the facility is predicated upon the amount of U.S. and Canadian eligible
inventory and Canadian receivables applied against certain advance rates. Depending upon the
amount of excess availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, interest is calculated at LIBOR
plus a margin that ranges between 10% and 175% or at the Index Rate prime rate published by the
Wall Street Journal plus a margin that ranges between 025% and 050%. As long as the average
daily excess availability for both the preceding and projected succeeding 90-day period is greater
than $50million, we would be permitted to make acquisitions and repurchase outstanding public
stock and bonds. The above permitted transactions would also be allowed if such excess availability is between
$25million and $50million and our fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined by the revolving credit
agreement, is at least 125 to 10 after taking into consideration the permitted transaction.
Additionally, if excess availability under the agreement is less than $50million, then WESCO must
maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 11 to 10. At December31, 2005, the interest rate was
63%. WESCO was in compliance with all such covenants as of December31, 2005. During 2005, WESCO borrowed $343million in the aggregate under the Revolving Credit Facility
and made repayments in the aggregate amount of $314million. During 2004, aggregate borrowings and
repayments each were $3576million. At December31, 2005, WESCO had an outstanding balance under
the facility of $29million, of which $145 is classified as short-term debt. WESCO had
approximately $228million available under the facility at December31, 2005, after giving effect
to an outstanding letter of credit, as compared to approximately $172million at December31, 2004. 48 Table of Contents Mortgage Financing Facility In February2003, WESCO finalized a mortgage financing facility of $51million, $482million
of which was outstanding as of December31, 2005. Total borrowings under the mortgage financing
facility are subject to a 22-year amortization schedule, with a balloon payment due at the end of
the 10-year term. The interest rate on borrowings under this facility is fixed at 65%. Proceeds
from the borrowings were used primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under WESCOs revolving
credit facility. Bruckner Note Payable In 2004, WESCO finalized the remaining amount pursuant to the Bruckner purchase agreement.
This resulted in establishing a promissory note in favor of the sellers of $50million and in June
2005, we paid $30million in accordance with the terms of the promissory note. The remaining $20
million is due in June2006 and is classified as short-term debt. 9125% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 In June1998 and August2001, WESCO Distribution, Inc. completed offerings of $300million and
$100million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 9125% Senior Subordinated Notes due
2008 the 2008 Notes. The 2008 Notes were issued at an average issue price of 98% of par. The
net proceeds received from the 2008 Notes were approximately $376million. The net proceeds were
used to repay outstanding indebtedness. The 2008 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
WESCO International, Inc. During 2003 and 2004, WESCO repurchased $211million and $553million, respectively, in
aggregate principal amount 2008 Notes. WESCO recorded a net loss of $26million in 2004 and a net
gain of $06million in 2003. As of December31, 2004, WESCO had outstanding $3235million in
aggregate principal amount of 2008 Notes. During 2005, WESCO Distribution redeemed all of the remaining principal amount of the 2008
Notes, incurring a charge of $149million. The charge included the payment of a redemption price
at 101521% of par and the write-off of unamortized original issue discount and debt issue costs. Interest Rate Swap Agreements In September2003, WESCO entered into a $50million interest rate swap agreement and, in
December2003, WESCO entered into two additional $25million interest rate swap agreements as a
means to hedge its interest rate exposure and maintain certain amounts of variable rate and fixed
rate debt. Net amounts to be received or paid under the swap agreements were reflected as
adjustments to interest expense. These agreements had terms expiring concurrently with the
maturity of 2008 Notes and were entered into with the intent of effectively converting $100million
of the 2008 Notes from a fixed to a floating rate. Pursuant to these agreements, WESCO received
semi-annual fixed interest payments at the rate of 9125% commencing December1, 2003 and made
semi-annual variable interest rate payments at six-month LIBOR rates plus a premium in arrears. In October2005, in conjunction with the redemption of the 2008 Notes, WESCO terminated its
three interest rate swap agreements, resulting in termination fees of $23million. Upon
redemption of the 2008 Notes, the balance of the unamortized gain in the amount of $24million was
recognized as income. The net of the termination fees and interest rate swap resulted in income
before taxes of $01million in 2005. 750% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 At December31, 2005, $150million in aggregate principal amount of the 750% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2017 the 2017 Notes was outstanding. The 2017 Notes were issued by WESCO
Distribution under an indenture dated as of September27, 2005 with J.P. Morgan Trust Company,
National Association, as trustee, and are unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by WESCO
International, Inc. The 2017 Notes accrue interest at the rate of 750% per annum and are payable
in cash semi-annually in arrears on each April15 and October15, commencing April15, 2006. At any time on or after October15, 2010, WESCO Distribution may redeem all or a part of the
2017 Notes. Between October15, 2010 and October14, 2011, WESCO Distribution may redeem all or a
part of the 2017 Notes at a redemption price equal to 103750% of the principal amount. Between
October15, 2011 and October14, 2012, WESCO Distribution may
redeem all or a part of the 2017 Notes at a redemption price equal to 102500% of the principal
amount. On and after October15, 2013, WESCO Distribution may redeem all or a part of the 2017
Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount. 49 Table of Contents If WESCO Distribution undergoes a change of control prior to maturity, holders of 2017 Notes
will have the right, at their option, to require WESCO Distribution to repurchase for cash some or
all of their 2017 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2017
Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase
date. 2625% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2025 At December31, 2005, $150million in aggregate principle amount of 2625% Convertible Senior
Debentures due 2025 the Debentures was outstanding. The Debentures were issued by WESCO
International, Inc. under an indenture dated as of September27, 2005 with J.P. Morgan Trust
Company, National Association, as Trustee, and are unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior
subordinated basis by WESCO Distribution. The Debentures accrue interest at the rate of 2625% per
annum and are payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each April15 and October15, commencing
April15, 2006. Beginning with the six-month interest period commencing October15, 2010, WESCO
also will pay contingent interest in cash during any six-month interest period in which the trading
price of the Debentures for each of the five trading days ending on the second trading day
immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six-month interest period equals or exceeds
120% of the principal amount of the Debentures. During any interest period when contingent
interest shall be payable, the contingent interest payable per $1,000 principal amount of
Debentures will equal 025% of the average trading price of $1,000 principal amount of the
Debentures during the five trading days immediately preceding the first day of the applicable
six-month interest period. As defined in SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedge Activities the contingent interest feature of the Debentures is an embedded derivate that is
not considered clearly and closely related to the host contract. The contingent interest component
had no value at issuance or at December31, 2005. The Convertible Debentures are convertible into cash and, in certain circumstances, shares of
WESCO International, Inc.s common stock, $01 par value, at any time on or after October15, 2023,
or prior to October15, 2023 in certain circumstances. The Convertible Debentures will be
convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 238872 shares of common stock per $1,000
principal amount of the Debentures equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately
$4186 per share. The conversion rate and the conversion price may be adjusted under certain
circumstances. At any time on or after October15, 2010, WESCO may redeem all or a part of the Debentures at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures plus accrued and unpaid
interest including contingent interest and additional interest, if any to, but not including, the
redemption date. Holders of Debentures may require WESCO to repurchase all or a portion of their
Debentures on October15, 2010, October15, 2015 and October15, 2020 at a cash repurchase price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest
including contingent interest and additional interest, if any to, but not including, the
repurchase date. If WESCO undergoes certain fundamental changes prior to maturity, holders of
Debentures will have the right, at their option, to require WESCO to repurchase for cash some or
all of their Debentures at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Debentures being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and
additional interest, if any to, but not including, the repurchase date. Covenant Compliance WESCO was in compliance with all relevant covenants contained in our debt agreements as of
December31, 2005. The following table sets forth the aggregate principal repayment requirements for all
indebtedness for the next five years and thereafter in thousands

50 Table of Contents WESCOs credit agreements contain various restrictive covenants that, among other things,
impose limitations on idividend payments or certain other restricted payments or investments;
iithe incurrence of additional indebtedness and guarantees or issuance of additional stock;
iiicreation of liens; ivmergers, consolidation or sales of substantially all of WESCOs
assets; vcertain transactions among affiliates; vipayments by certain subsidiaries to WESCO;
and viicapital expenditures. In addition, the revolving credit agreement requires WESCO to meet
certain fixed charge coverage tests depending on availability. WESCO had $249million of outstanding letters of credit at December31, 2004 that were used
as collateral for interest rate swap agreements. In conjunction with the redemption of the 2008
Notes and the termination of the interest rate swap agreements in October2005, the letters of
credit were terminated, resulting in no outstanding letters of credit at December31, 2005. 9. CAPITAL STOCK Preferred Stock There are 20million shares of preferred stock authorized at a par value of $01 per share.
The Board of Directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue all
authorized preferred shares in one or more series and to fix the number of shares, designations,
voting powers, preferences, optional and other special rights and the restrictions or
qualifications thereof. The rights, preferences, privileges and powers of each series of preferred
stock may differ with respect to dividend rates, liquidation values, voting rights, conversion
rights, redemption provisions and other matters. Common Stock There are 210million shares of common stock and 20million shares of ClassB common stock
authorized at a par value of $01 per share. The ClassB common stock is identical to the common
stock, except for voting and conversion rights. The holders of ClassB common stock have no voting
rights. With certain exceptions, ClassB common stock may be converted, at the option of the
holder, into the same number of shares of common stock. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, WESCO is restricted from declaring or paying
dividends and as such, at December31, 2005 and 2004, no dividends had been declared, and therefore
no retained earnings were reserved for dividend payments. In November2003, WESCOs board of directors authorized a special repurchase of WESCOs
ClassB common stock. Pursuant to the authorization, 43million shares of ClassB common stock
were repurchased from an institutional holder, at a discount to market, for approximately $273
million. Prior to the repurchase, 03million ClassB shares were converted to 03million shares
of common stock when they were sold on the secondary markets by the institutional holder. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, all the shares of ClassB common stock were held in treasury or had
been converted to common stock. In December2004, WESCO completed a public offering of 40million shares of its common stock.
Certain selling stockholders offered an additional 71million shares of common stock. The net
proceeds to WESCO of approximately $999million after deducting the underwriting discounts and
offering expenses were used to repurchase a portion of WESCOs senior subordinated notes. 51 Table of Contents 10. INCOME TAXES The following table sets forth the components of the provision for income taxes

The Jobs Act was established on October22, 2004. One provision of the Jobs
Act effectively reduces the tax rate on qualifying repatriation of earnings held by
foreign-based subsidiaries to approximately 525percent. Normally, such repatriations would
be taxed at a rate of 35percent. In the fourth quarter of 2005, WESCO elected to repatriate
approximately $230million under the Jobs Act. This repatriation of earnings triggered a U.S.
federal tax payment of approximately $10million. This amount is reflected in the current
income tax expense. Prior to the Jobs Act, WESCO did not provide deferred taxes on
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as WESCO intended to utilize these earnings
through expansion of its business operations outside the United States for an indefinite
period of time.   4
Represents the recognition of a $06million benefit associated with the utilization

In 2005, represents a benefit of $12million from Research and Development credits. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, WESCO had state tax benefits derived from net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $157million $102million, net of federal income tax and
$134million $87million, net of federal income tax, respectively. The amounts will begin
expiring in 2006. The realization of these state deferred tax assets is dependent upon future
earnings, if any, and the timing and amount are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax
assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by
approximately $15million in 2005 and $04million in 2004. Utilization of WESCOs state net
operating loss carryforwards is subject to a substantial annual limitation imposed by
state statute. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards 52 Table of Contents before utilization. As of December31, 2005, WESCO had approximately $90million of undistributed earnings
related to its foreign subsidiaries. Management believes that these earnings will be indefinitely
reinvested in foreign jurisdiction; accordingly, WESCO has not provided for U.S. federal income
taxes related to these earnings. The following table sets forth deferred tax assets and liabilities

11. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common
shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the
periods. The dilutive effect of common share equivalents is considered in the diluted earnings per
share computation using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the details of basic and diluted earnings per share

Stock-settled stock appreciation rights of 17million and 09million at a weighted
average exercise price of $2800 and $2402 per share were outstanding as of December31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to
do so would have been antidilutive for the years ending December31, 2005 and 2004. In addition,
to the extent that the average share price during the three-month period ending December31, 2005
first three-month period subsequent to the offering of the Debentures exceeds the Debentures
conversion price of $4186 per share, an incremental number of up to 3,583,080 shares is included
in determining diluted earnings per share using the Treasury method of accounting as represented in
the table below. For the year ended December31, 2005, WESCOs average share price did not exceed
the conversion price and hence, there was no effect of the Debentures on diluted earnings per
share. The Debentures include a contingent conversion price provision and the option for a settlement
in shares, known as net share settlement. The FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No04-8,
The Effect of Contingently Convertible
Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share, requires WESCO to include the diluted earnings per
share calculation, regardless of whether the requirements at the conversion feature have been met.
Furthermore, the FASB is contemplating an amendment 53 Table of Contents to SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share, that would
require WESCO to assume net share settlement for the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per
share. Under EITF No04-8, and EITF 90-19 Convertible Bonds with Issuer Option to Settle for Cash
upon Conversion, and because of WESCOs obligation to settle the par value of the Debentures in
cash, WESCO is not required to include any shares underlying the Debentures in its diluted weighted
average shares outstanding until the average stock price per share for the quarter exceeds the
$4186 conversion price and only to the extent of the additional shares WESCO may be required to
issue in the event WESCOs conversion obligation exceeds the principal amount of the Debentures
converted. At such time, only the number of shares that would be issuable under the treasury
method of accounting for share dilution will be included, which is based upon the amount by which
the average stock price exceeds the conversion price. For the first $1 per share that WESCOs
average stock price exceeds the $4186 conversion price of the Debentures, WESCO will include
approximately 83,000 additional shares in WESCOs diluted share count. For the second $1 per share
that WESCOs average stock price exceeds the $4186 conversion price, WESCO will include
approximately 80,000 additional shares, for a total of approximately 163,000 shares, in WESCOs
diluted share count, and so on, with the additional shares dilution decreasing for each $1 per
share that WESCOs average stock price exceeds $4186 if the stock price rises further above $4186

for their service rendered subsequent to WESCOs formation. For U.S. participants, WESCO will make
contributions in an amount equal to 50% of the participants total monthly contributions up to a
maximum of 6% of eligible compensation. For Canadian participants, WESCO will make contributions
in an amount ranging from 1% to 7% of the participants eligible compensation based on years of
continuous service. In addition, employer contributions may be made at the discretion of the Board
of Directors and can be based on WESCOs financial performance. Discretionary employer
contributions were made in the amount of $104million, $88million and $42million in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, WESCO contributed to
all such plans $168million, $151million and $95million, respectively, which was charged to
expense. Contributions are made in cash to employee retirement savings plan accounts. Employees
then have the option to transfer into any of their investment options, including WESCO stock. 13. STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS Stock Purchase Plans In connection with the 1998 recapitalization, WESCO established a stock purchase plan 1998
Stock Purchase Plan
under which certain employees may be granted an opportunity to purchase WESCOs common stock.
The maximum number of shares available for purchase may not exceed 427,720. There were no shares
issued in 2005, 2004 or 2003. 54 Table of Contents Stock Option Plans WESCO has sponsored four stock option plans, the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the
1998 Stock Option Plan, the Stock Option Plan for Branch Employees and the 1994 Stock Option Plan.
The LTIP was designed to be the successor plan to all prior plans. Outstanding options under prior
plans will continue to be governed by their existing terms, which are substantially similar to the
LTIP. Any remaining shares reserved for future issuance under the prior plans are available for
issuance under the LTIP. The LTIP and predecessor plans are administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors. An initial reserve of 6,936,000 shares of common stock has been authorized for issuance under
the LTIP. This reserve automatically increases by ithe number of shares of common stock covered
by unexercised options granted under prior plans that are canceled or terminated after the
effective date of the LTIP, and iithe number of shares of common stock surrendered by employees
to pay the exercise price and/or minimum withholding taxes in connection with the exercise of stock
options granted under our prior plans. Options granted vest and become exercisable once criteria based on time or financial
performance are achieved. If the financial performance criteria are not met, all the options will
vest after nine years and nine months. All options vest immediately in the event of a change in
control. Each option terminates on the tenth anniversary of its grant date unless terminated
sooner under certain conditions. During December2003, in a privately negotiated transaction with 19 employees, WESCO redeemed
the net equity value of stock options originally granted in 1994 and 1995, representing
approximately 29million shares. The options held by the employees had a weighted average price
of $175. The options were redeemed at a price of $863 per share. The cash payment of $201
million was made in January2004. WESCO recognized a tax benefit of $73million as a result of
this transaction. From June2005 through December2005, WESCO granted 908,889 stock-settled stock appreciation
rights at an average exercise price of $3185. None of these awards
was cancelled in 2005 and
none was exercisable at December31, 2005. All awards under WESCOs stock incentive plans are designed to be issued at fair market value. As of December31, 2005, 46million shares of common stock were reserved under the LTIP for
future equity award grants. The following table sets forth a summary of both stock options and stock appreciation rights
and related information for the years indicated

Rental expense for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $332million 331million and $325million, respectively. From time to time, a number of lawsuits and claims have been or may be asserted against WESCO
relating to the conduct of its business, including routine litigation relating to commercial and
employment matters. The outcomes of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some
lawsuits may be determined adversely to WESCO. However, management does not believe that the
ultimate outcome is likely to have a material adverse effect on WESCOs financial condition or
liquidity, although the resolution in any fiscal quarter of one or more of these matters may have a
material adverse effect on WESCOs results of operations for that period. WESCO is a defendant in a lawsuit in a state court in Florida in which
a former supplier alleges that WESCO failed to fulfill its commercial obligations to purchase
product and seeks monetary damages in excess of $17 million. WESCO
believes that it has meritorious defenses. Neither the outcome nor
the monetary impact of this litigation can be predicted at this time.
A trial is scheduled for October2006. WESCO was a defendant in a suit filed in federal district court in
northern California alleging antitrust, contract and other claims. On August9, 2005, WESCO and
the plaintiff agreed to settle this lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement, both parties
agreed to release all claims against the other in exchange for cash and other consideration. On
October14, 2005, as stipulated by the settlement agreement, the majority of the cash settlement
amount was paid. The settlement plus related litigation expenses resulted in a charge of $69
million, net of income tax, in 2005. In 2003, WESCO reached a final settlement agreement related to an employment and wages claim
with the case being dismissed with prejudice. WESCO settled the case for $34million and received
a refund of approximately $300,000 of that amount. 15. SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION WESCO

million shares of common stock resulting in equity issuance costs of $51million. J
Stock option expense for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2004 was
$04million, $04million, $06million and $16million, respectively. K
Diluted earnings per share DEPSin each quarter is computed using the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during that quarter while DEPS for the full year is
computed by taking the average of the weighted average number of shares outstanding each
quarter. Thus, the sum of the four quarters DEPS may not equal the full-year DEPS. 18. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On March3, 2006, Dana Corporation, Dana and forty of its domestic subsidiaries filed

Item 5. Controls and Procedures. Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as such term is defined under Rule13a-15e promulgated under the Exchange
Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation
under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2005. Management has
excluded Carlton-Bates Company and Fastec Industrial Corp. from its assessment of internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 because they were acquired by the Company in
purchase business combinations during 2005. Carlton-Bates Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary
whose total assets and total revenues represent $2917million and $768million, respectively, of
the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31,
2005. Fastec Industrial Corp. is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues
represent $448million and $277million, respectively, of the related consolidated financial
statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2005. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the last fiscal quarter of 2005, there were no changes in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting identified in connection with managements evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Item9B. Other Information. None. 63 Table of Contents PART III
