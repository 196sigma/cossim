Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Forrester Research, Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December
31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

December31, 2013 
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Forrester Research, Inc.
Forrester or the Company is an independent research company that provides pragmatic and forward-thinking advice to global leaders in business and technology. Forresters products and services are targeted to specific
roles, including senior management in business strategy, marketing, and technology management principally at $1billion-plus revenue companies who collaborate with Forrester to accelerate achievement of their business goals. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Forrester considers the more
significant of these estimates to be revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, and valuation and impairment of marketable investments. On an ongoing basis, management
evaluates its estimates. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value Measurements 
The Company has certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level1, 2 or 3 within the fair value
hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements. Level1 Fair value based on
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level2 Fair value based on inputs other
than Level1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level3 Fair value based
on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and such inputs are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term
maturities. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Investments 
Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90days or less to
be cash equivalents. The Companys investments at December31, 2012 with an auction reset feature were classified as long-term investments at December31, 2012. The Companys investments are composed of securities of U.S.government agencies, municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, and money market funds. Forrester accounts for all marketable
investments as available-for-sale securities and as such, the marketable investments are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses not related to credit losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
F-7 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses on securities are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method. The Company conducts periodic reviews to
identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards. An unrealized loss
exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in
accumulated other comprehensive income. The determination of whether a loss is considered temporary is based in part on whether the Company intends to sell the security or whether the Company would more likely than not be required to sell the
security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges on its available-for-sale securities. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk Forrester has no significant off-balance sheet or concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements. Financial instruments that
potentially subject Forrester to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, marketable investments, and accounts receivable. Forrester places its investments in highly rated securities. No single customer accounted for
greater than 2% of revenues or accounts receivable in any of the periods presented. Deferred Commissions
Commissions incurred in acquiring new or renewing existing contracts, which are earned in the month that a contract is
booked, are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized. Forrester evaluates the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date. 
Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is required to be tested for impairment annually. Furthermore, testing for impairment is required on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it
is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred. An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist,
the Company has selected November30 as the date for performing the annual goodwill impairment test. Goodwill impairment charges have not been required for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. 
Impairment of Other Long-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets 
Forrester continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of
long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired. To compute whether assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value. To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset. Impairment
charges have not been required for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Non-Current Liabilities
The Company records certain liabilities that are expected to be settled over a period that exceeds one year as
non-current liabilities. The Company also records as a non-current liability the portion of the deferred rent liability that is expected to be recognized over a period greater than one year. Non-current deferred rent liability at December31,
2013 and 2012 was $67 million and $69 million, respectively, and primarily results from the difference between cash payments and the straight-line recognition of rent expense under the Companys facility leases.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Foreign Currency 
The functional currency of the majority of Forresters wholly-owned subsidiaries is their respective local currency. These subsidiary
financial statements are translated to U.S.dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the corresponding period for revenues and expenses, with translation gains and losses accumulated
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency are included in other income, net in
the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, Forrester recorded $04 million, $04million and $13million of foreign exchange losses, respectively, in other income, net. 
In addition, Forresters German holding companies, for which the functional currency was the U.S. dollar, recognized
$01million of remeasurement gains on its deferred tax liability in income tax expense for both the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011. Effective July7, 2012 the Companys German holding companies were merged with the
Companys German operating company creating one German entity for which the functional currency is the euro.

Revenue Recognition 
Effective January1, 2011 the Company adopted Update No2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a
consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ASU 2009-13 for contracts entered into or materially modified after that date. ASU 2009-13 updates the previous multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance. The revised guidance
primarily provides three significant changes: 1 it eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting; 2 it eliminates
the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration; and 3 it modifies the fair value requirements of EITF Issue 00-21 by providing best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and vendor
objective evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable. In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on the Companys
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Forrester generates revenues from licensing research including our
data subscription products, performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events. Forrester executes contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement. Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and
services. Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products and services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent
on future performance conditions. The Company obtains the selling prices of its products and services based on an analysis of standalone sales of these products and services during the year. Research services revenues are recognized ratably over the
term of the contract. Advisory services revenues, such as workshops, speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues, which are short-term in nature and based upon
fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided. Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services revenue. Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the event. 
Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and depending on the type of
license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Webinars, and the right to attend one event. Contracts for RoleView research entered into prior to
the adoption of ASU 2009-13 on January1, 2011 are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period. Contracts for RoleView research entered into or significantly modified
after January1, 2011 are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1 the event ticket and 2 the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period, based on the new guidance that permits alternative methods of
determining selling price as it relates to the components that we do not sell on a standalone basis, such as research services in this case. Arrangement consideration is allocated to each of these elements based upon their relative selling prices,
which is based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services. Annual subscriptions to our data subscription products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data
specialist, which are delivered throughout the year, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period. For all contracts entered into through January 2013, clients were
offered a service guarantee, which gives them the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services. As of February1, 2013 the Company discontinued its policy of offering
all clients a service guarantee. Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantee,
which generally equals the vesting period. Cash flows resulting from the tax 
F-10 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for stock-based awards are classified as financing cash flows. The Company is required to estimate future forfeitures
of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense. The Company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher
than estimated. The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. In addition, for performance-vested restricted stock units, the Company makes estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in
order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned. The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the following expense categories in
thousands:  Years Ended December31 2013 2012 2011 Cost of services and fulfillment 3,585 3,085 1,644 Selling and marketing 1,136 894 751 General and administrative 1,330 1,418 1,247 
Total 6,051 5,397 3,642 
The options granted under the equity incentive plans and shares subject to the employee stock purchase
plan were valued utilizing the Black Scholes model using the following assumptions and had the following fair values:  Years Ended December31 2013 2012 2011 EquityIncentivePlans EmployeeStockPurchase Plan EquityIncentivePlans EmployeeStockPurchase Plan EquityIncentivePlans EmployeeStockPurchase Plan Average risk-free interest rate 085 012 085 014 125 013 Expected dividend yield 21 19 17 17 None None Expected life 49Years 05Years 45Years 05Years 35Years 05Years Expected volatility 36 22 40 31 40 28 Weighted average fair value 921 602 964 690 1047 755
The dividend yield of zero for 2011 is based on the fact that Forrester had never paid cash dividends
until the board of directors approved a special dividend of $300 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Dividend yields beginning in 2012 are based on the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend program approved by the board of
directors in February 2012. Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of Forresters common stock as well as managements expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted. The
risk-free interest rate used is based on the U.S.Treasury Constant Maturity rate with an equivalent remaining term. Where the expected term of a stock-based award does not correspond with a term for which the interest rates are quoted,
Forrester uses the rate with the maturity closest to the awards expected term. The expected term calculation is based upon Forresters historical experience of exercise patterns. The unamortized fair value of stock-based awards as of
December31, 2013 was $125 million, with a weighted average remaining recognition period of 22 years. Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts Forrester maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make contractually obligated payments. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company makes judgments regarding the collectability of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing
historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, and changes in the customer payment terms. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in
F-11 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of the Companys customers were to improve, the allowances may be
reduced accordingly. Depreciation and Amortization 
Forrester provides for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, computed using the straight-line method, over estimated
useful lives of assets as follows:  Estimated

Income Taxes Forrester recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well
as operating loss carryforwards. Forresters provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred provision
for federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The current provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated as the net change during the year in
deferred tax assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
Forrester accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain
tax positions. The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters
subject to audit, new audit activity, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. The Company evaluates these tax positions on a quarterly basis. The Company also accrues for potential interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Net Income Per Common Share 
Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of common
equivalent shares outstanding has been determined in accordance with the treasury-stock method. Common stock equivalents consist of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.

For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, options to purchase approximately
07million, 08million and 03million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the diluted weighted average common share calculation as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
New Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No2013-02, Comprehensive Income: Reporting Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This accounting standard requires
companies to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, companies are required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the
notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. This ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December15, 2012. Other than requiring additional
disclosures, adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial results. In
July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No2013-11,Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward ExistsASU 2013-11. ASU 2013-11
addresses the balance sheet presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. ASU 2013-11 requires that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an
unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. ASU No2013-11 is effective for the
Companys fiscal quarter ending March31, 2014 and impacts balance sheet presentation only. The Company believes the balance sheet impact will not be material. 
2 Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements 
During the quarter ended September30, 2013, the Company identified certain prior period errors that affected the
years ended December31, 2012 and 2011. The Company has reflected in the financial information included in this Note the correction of all identified prior period errors in the years in which they originated. The prior period errors relate to:
Adjustments to the Companys share of operating results in one of the technology-related investment funds in which the Company holds an interest,
which adjustments are principally a result of information received by the Company from the fund after the applicable reporting periods. The Company records a portion of the funds operating results, based on the Companys ownership
interest in the fund, as investment gains losses. The adjustments to the gains losses on investments were $05 million and $14 million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effect of this error has been
reflected in other assets in the revised consolidated balance sheet and in net gains losses from investments in the revised consolidated statement of cash flows presented below.  Adjustments to revenue for historical insignificant variances in deferred revenue for reconciling items between the Companys general ledger and
sub-ledger system. The increase decrease to revenue was $01 million and $04million for the years ended December31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effect of this error has been reflected in deferred revenue in the revised
consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows presented below.
F-13 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  An adjustment of $01 million for the year ended December31, 2011 to increase the amount of research services revenue related to recognition of
revenue for the event ticket included in the Companys RoleView and Forrester Leadership Board subscription products. The effect of this error has been reflected in deferred revenue in the revised consolidated balance sheet and statement of
cash flows presented below. In addition, during the quarter ended December31, 2013, the Company
identified certain prior period errors related to income taxes that affected the year ended December31, 2012. The Company has reflected in the financial information included in this Note the correction of all identified prior period errors.
The prior period errors relate to:  Adjustment of $04 million to decrease income tax expense for the year ended December31, 2012 to correct the amount of net operating losses as a
result of a settlement of a tax audit at the Companys German subsidiary. The effect of this error has been reflected in other assets in the revised consolidated balance sheet and in deferred taxes in the revised consolidated statement of cash
flows presented below.  Adjustment of $01 million to increase income tax expense for the year ended December31, 2012 to correct for insignificant errors. The effect of
these errors has been reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets, other assets and non-current liabilities in the revised consolidated balance sheet and in the related accounts in the revised consolidated statement of cash flows
presented below. In evaluating whether the Companys previously issued consolidated financial
statements were materially misstated, the Company considered the guidance in ASC Topic 250,Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, ASC Topic 250-10-S99-1, Assessing Materiality, and ASC Topic 250-10-S99-2,Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. The Company concluded that these errors were not material individually or in the aggregate to any of the prior reporting periods, and therefore, amendments
of previously filed reports are not required. As such, the revisions for prior period corrections are reflected in the financial information for the applicable prior periods and are revised in the financial statements herein. See Note 14,
Summary Selected Quarterly Financial Data unaudited for the impact of the revision on each of the applicable prior periods. The effects of these prior period errors on the consolidated financial statements are as follows in thousands, except per share amounts:

Springboard Research On May12, 2011, Forrester acquired Springboard Research Springboard, a provider of research and advisory services focused on Asia Pacific and emerging markets. Springboard was a former
division of Knowledge Platform, Inc. The acquisition of the Springboard business further supports Forresters role-based strategy and expands Forresters coverage in the Asia Pacific region. The total purchase price was approximately
$90million, of which approximately $67million was paid on the acquisition date and $23million the

Holdback was payable at various times through June1, 2013, subject to possible reduction to satisfy indemnification claims. Of the $23million Holdback, up to
$09million was contingent on the retention of certain employees for a period of time and on the extension of a certain lease. As of May 2012 the two referenced contingency provisions had elapsed with the full amount payable to Knowledge
Platform. As of December31, 2013, the entire Holdback had been paid and, as of December31, 2012, $09 million of the Holdback remained in accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The results of Springboard Research, which were
not material to the consolidated financial statements, have been included in Forresters consolidated financial statements since May12, 2011 in the Business Technology segment. Pro forma financial information has not been provided as it

$62 million and $321 million included in cash and cash equivalents at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, as original maturities at the time of purchase
were 90 days or less. Level 2 assets consist of the Companys entire portfolio of federal, state, municipal
and corporate bonds, excluding those municipal bonds described below with an auction reset feature. Level 2 assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, typically utilizing
third party pricing services or other market observable data. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation methods, including both income and market based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value. These observable
market inputs include reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. At December31, 2013 the Company held no Level 3 assets. Prior to October30, 2013 the Company held state and municipal bonds with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or
ARS. In February2008, auctions began to fail for these securities and continued to fail throughout 2013. On October30, 2013 the Company sold its entire portfolio of ARS for net proceeds of $91 million and realized a loss on
the sale of $19million. Level 3 assets at December31, 2012 consisted entirely of ARS. While the Company received

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
interest income on its ARS investments at each interest reset date which occurred at either 7 or 35 day intervals for each security, these investments traded infrequently and therefore did not
have a readily determinable market value. Interest rates on the securities ranged from 01% to 04% and 01% to 05% during 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company valued the ARS using a discounted cash flow model that included unobservable inputs
including estimates of interest rates, discount rates and expected holding periods of the securities, which is considered a Level 3 valuation. Unobservable inputs included in the valuation as of December31, 2012 included a weighted average
interest rate of 09%, a weighted average discount rate of 39%, and a weighted average holding period of 87 years. The valuation resulted in an unrealized loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
of $20million at December31, 2012. The Company believed that the loss was temporary due to the strong underlying credit rating of the securities and the fact that the Company did not intend to sell the securities and was not likely to
be required to sell the securities. The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Companys

Non-Marketable Investments 
At December31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying value of the Companys non-marketable investments, which were
composed primarily of interests in technology-related private equity funds, were $57million and $66million, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
One of the Companys investments, with a book value of $09million and $12million at December31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, is being accounted for using the cost method and, accordingly, is valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in its value occurs. The other investments are being accounted for using the equity method as the investments
are limited partnerships and the Company has an ownership interest in excess of 5% and, accordingly, the Company records its share of the investees operating results each period. During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
the Company recorded gains losses from its non-marketable investments of approximately $06million, $01million and $04million, respectively, which are included in gains losses on investments, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, gross distributions of $04million, $05million and $05million, respectively, were received from the funds. 
In May 2013, the Company extended the expiration date of a cash bonus plan, originally adopted in 2000, that would pay a bonus, after the
return of invested capital from certain of the Companys investments, to certain key employees. To date, no bonuses have been paid under the plan. The plan will now automatically expire on June30, 2015, subject to earlier expiration as
provided in the plan in the event that prior to such date there are less than 10 participants in the plan or all of the Companys invested capital as defined in the plan has been returned to the Company.

In July 2012, one of the Companys non-U.S. subsidiaries licensed the intellectual property rights
for the territory outside of the U.S. from the Companys U.S. entity in order to align the Companys business with its global operations. The license of intellectual property occurred between two wholly owned legal entities within
Forrester that are based in different tax jurisdictions, creating a taxable gain reportable in the transferor entitys jurisdiction. The gain is recognized for income tax purposes only and not in the financial statements. As the gain was the
result of an intra-entity transaction, it was eliminated in consolidation for purposes of the consolidated financial statements. 
In accordance with GAAP, no gain or immediate tax impact should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements as a result of an
intra-entity transaction. The Company recognizes tax expense specifically associated with an intra-entity transfer of intangible property over a period equal to the expected economic lives of the underlying assets being licensed. An amortization
period of 95 years was determined based on the estimated economic lives of the intellectual property licensed. Current net
deferred tax assets and long-term net deferred tax assets were $22 and $37 million as of December31, 2013 and $04 and $13 million as of December31, 2012, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets,
respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current net deferred tax liabilities and long-term net deferred tax liabilities were $02 million and $09 million as of December31, 2013 and $05 and $02 million as of December31, 2012,
and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net
deferred income tax asset. Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. In arriving at these judgments, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the
extent to which it can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured, based upon the Companys historical taxable income and projections of the Companys future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax
assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, as discussed below. 
As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $22million and
$21million, respectively, primarily relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards from an acquisition and U.S.capital losses. 
F-22 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
As of December31, 2013, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $77million obtained from acquired businesses. These carryforwards are limited pursuant to section382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to changes in ownership as a result of the acquisitions. If unused,
these carryforwards would expire on various dates from 2019 through 2028. The Company also has foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $252million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. Approximately $56million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards relate to a prior acquisition, the utilization of which is subject to
limitation under the tax law of the United Kingdom. In the third quarter of 2012 the Company settled a tax audit at its German subsidiary resulting in the recognition of $59 million in deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses and
intangible assets at this subsidiary. As of December31, 2013, the Company had U.S.federal and state capital loss
carryforwards of $23million, of which $09million expires in 2014, $08 million expires in 2016 and $06 million expires in 2018. The following table provides a summary of the changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 in thousands: 2013 2012 2011 Deferred tax valuation allowance at January 1 2,086 3,077 2,676 Additions 801 11 508 Deductions 712 1,066 85 Translation adjustments 25 64 22 
Deferred tax valuation allowance at December 31 2,200 2,086 3,077 
During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized approximately
$04million, $03 million and $05million, respectively, of net tax benefits deficiencies from tax deductions in excess of or less than book deductions resulting from employee stock option exercises. The net tax benefits
deficiencies were recorded as an increase decrease to additional paid-in-capital. Excess tax benefits from share-based payments are recognized in the year that the deduction reduces the amount of cash payable for taxes. 
Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $107 million as of December31, 2013.
The Company has not provided any additional federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings as such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in the business. Due to the various methods by which such
earnings could be repatriated in the future, the amount of taxes attributable to the undistributed earnings is not practicably determinable. The Company utilizes a two-step process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on a tax return. The first step is a determination of whether the
tax position should be recognized in the financial statements. The second step determines the measurement of the tax

position. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as follows for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 in thousands:
2013 2012 2011 Unrecognized tax benefits at January 1 1,844 1,269 1,222 Additions for tax positions of prior years 414 112 107 Reductions for tax positions of prior years 256 37 Additions for tax positions of current year 19 1,444 17 Settlements 582 Lapse of statute of limitations 360 77 Translation adjustments 9 2 
Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31 2,012 1,844 1,269 
As of December31, 2013, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $20
million, all of which if recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate in a future period. It is not expected that a significant amount of unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized within the next 12 months. 
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense and such amounts were not material
in the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. At December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had approximately $01 million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. 
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S.and in foreign jurisdictions. Generally, the Company is no longer subject to U.S.,
state, local and foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions for years before 2006, except to the extent of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from those years. Major taxing jurisdictions include the
U.S., the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland. The Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service of the U.S. for tax year 2011 and currently anticipates the audit to conclude in mid-2014. 8

Stockholders Equity 
Preferred Stock Forrester has authorized 500,000shares of $01par value preferred stock. The Board of Directors has full authority to issue this stock and to fix the voting powers, preferences, rights,
qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or designation of such series. 
Treasury Stock Through 2013, Forresters Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate $3850million to purchase common stock under its stock repurchase program including $250 million authorized in July
2013 and $500million authorized in February 2013. The shares repurchased may be used, among other things, in connection with Forresters equity incentive and purchase plans. As of December31, 2013 the Company had repurchased
approximately 124million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $3291 million. On April3, 2013 the
Company commenced a modified Dutch auction self-tender offer to repurchase up to $130 million of its common stock at a price per share within the range of $3200 to $3600. A modified Dutch auction self-tender offer allows
stockholders to indicate how many shares and at what price within the companys specified range in increments of $025 per share they wish to tender. When the tender offer expired, based upon the number of shares tendered and the prices
specified by the tendering stockholders, the Company determined the purchase price, which was the lowest price per share within the range that enabled the Company to purchase up to $130 million of its common stock. The tender offer expired on
May1, 2013 and the Company purchased 2,054,732 shares of its common stock on May7, 2013 at a purchase price of $3600 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $740 million, plus approximately $11 million of expenses related to the
tender offer. For the year ended December31, 2013, the Company retired 117million shares of treasury stock. These
retired shares are now included in the Companys pool of authorized but unissued shares. The retired stock had a carrying value of approximately $3030 million. The Companys accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock
is to deduct the par value of the retired stock from Common Stock and to reflect the excess of cost over par value as a deduction from Additional Paid-in Capital. Dividends During the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012,
the Company declared and paid four quarterly dividends of $015 and $014 per share each quarter, respectively, amounting to $060 or $124 million and $056per share or $126 million per year, respectively. 
Equity Plans Forrester maintains the following four equity incentive plans: the Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Incentive Plan the 2006Plan, the Amended and Restated 1996 Equity Incentive Plan
the 1996 Plan, the 2006 Stock Option Plan for Directors, as amended the 2006Directors Plan and the 1996 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors the 1996Directors Plan. Upon
approval of the 2006 Plan and the 2006Directors Plan by stockholders, no future awards under the 1996 Plan and 1996Directors Plan could be granted or issued. In addition, upon approval of an amendment to the 2006 Plan by
stockholders in 2012, no future awards under the 2006 Directors Plan could be granted or issued. The 2006 Plan provides
for the issuance of stock-based awards, including incentive stock options ISOs, non-qualified stock options NSOs, and restricted stock units RSUs to purchase up to 4,350,000shares authorized in the
2006 Plan plus up to 2,500,000shares returned from the 1996 Plan and 80,000 shares returned

The 2006Directors Plan provided for the issuance of options to purchase up to 450,000shares of common stock. Prior to the 2012 annual stockholders meeting, each non-employee director was
entitled to receive an option to purchase 6,000shares of common stock, at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock upon his or her election as a director. These options vest in four equal annual installments, with
the first installment vested on the date of grant. In addition, prior to the 2010 annual stockholder meeting, each non-employee director was entitled to receive an option to purchase 12,500shares of common stock, at an exercise price equal to

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $61 million 35million and $41million, respectively. Restricted Stock Units 
Restricted stock units RSUs represent the right to receive one share of Forrester common stock when the restrictions lapse
and the vesting conditions are met, and are valued on the date of grant based upon the value of the Companys stock on the date of grant less the present value of dividends expected to be paid during the requisite service period. Shares of
Forresters common stock will be delivered to the grantee upon vesting, subject to a reduction of shares for payment of withholding taxes. The weighted average grant date fair value for RSUs granted in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $3458, $3388 and
$3315, respectively. The value of RSUs vested and converted to common stock, based on the value of Forresters common stock on the date of vesting, was $24 million, $16 million and $04 million during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
In 2009, the Company issued to its employees 95,496 performance-based RSUs. The vesting of the RSUs was subject to performance
criteria and would vest at 100% or 40% on April1, 2012, or the RSUs could be forfeited, depending on whether specified revenue growth and certain operating margin targets related to full year 2011 performance were achieved. Based on 2011
financial performance, 40% of the then outstanding RSUs vested on April1, 2012. Compensation expense in 2010 and 2009 was recognized based on an estimate of 100% vesting of the RSUs and in 2011 the Company modified it assessment of vesting to
the 40% level. In 2010, the Company issued to its employees approximately 63,000 performance-based RSUs. The vesting of the
RSUs was subject to performance criteria and would vest at 100% or 40% on April1, 2013, or the RSUs could be forfeited, depending on whether specified revenue growth and certain operating margin targets related to full year 2012 performance
were achieved. Based on 2012 financial performance the RSUs were forfeited as of April1, 2013. Compensation expense in 2010 was recognized based on an estimate of 100% vesting of the RSUs and in 2011 the Company modified its assessment of
vesting to a zero percent level. In 2011, the Company issued to its employees approximately 71,000 performance-based RSUs. The
vesting of the RSUs is subject to performance criteria and will vest at 100% or 40% on April1, 2014, or the RSUs could be forfeited, depending on whether specified revenue growth and certain operating margin targets related to full year 2013

Forrester sponsors several defined contribution plans for eligible employees. Generally, the defined contribution plans
have funding provisions which, in certain situations, require contributions based upon formulas relating to employee wages or the level of elective participant contributions, as well as allow for additional discretionary contributions. Further,
certain plans contain vesting provisions. Forresters contributions to these plans totaled approximately $36million, $32million and $30million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Reorganization 
During the year ended December31, 2013 the Company incurred $19 million of severance and related costs for the
elimination of 31 jobs or approximately 25% of its workforce worldwide to streamline operations. In the first quarter of 2012
the Company realigned its sales force to simplify the selling process to its customers and to increase the productivity of the sales organization. The Company incurred approximately $04 million of severance costs in the fourth quarter of 2011 for
three sales employees located outside of the U.S. based on statutory termination benefits in their country of employment and the fact that termination was considered probable at December31, 2011. The Company incurred an additional $14 million
of severance and related costs in 2012 for the termination of 17 additional employees related to the sales reorganization and other cost reduction initiatives.

Operating Segment and Enterprise Wide Reporting 
At the end of 2013 the Company reorganized its fulfillment organization into a single global research organization and
a single global product organization to better support its client base by facilitating better research collaboration and quality, promoting a more uniform client experience and improved customer satisfaction, and encouraging innovation. During 2013
the Company also established a dedicated consulting organization to provide research-based project consulting services to its clients, allowing the Companys analysts to spend additional time on writing research and providing shorter-term
advisory services. The Company anticipates reporting for 2014 fiscal periods segment information for the newly formed research, product, and consulting organizations, and to cease reporting on its historical client group organization. 
Throughout 2013 the Company evaluated its business operations based on its historical client group organization. Until October 2013 the
Company was organized into two client groups with each client group responsible for writing relevant research for the roles within the client organization on a worldwide basis. The two client groups, which were considered operating segments, were:
Business Technology BT and Marketing and Strategy MS. In addition, the Companys Events segment supported both client groups. Each client group generated revenue through sales of research, advisory and other
service offerings targeted at specific roles within their targeted clients. Each client group consisted of research personnel focused primarily on issues relevant to particular roles and to the day-to-day responsibilities of persons within the
roles. Amounts included in the Events segment relate to the operations of the events production department. Revenue reported in the Events segment consists primarily of sponsorships and sales of event tickets to Forrester events. 
The Company evaluates reportable segment performance and allocates resources based on direct margin. Direct margin, as presented below, is
defined as operating income excluding sales expenses, certain marketing and fulfillment

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
expenses, stock-based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets and reorganization costs. In the first quarter of 2013,
the Company modified segment direct margin for each of the BT and MS clients groups to reflect the transfer of revenue and direct costs related to one product line from BT to MS and to reallocate certain shared consulting costs between BT
and MS. Accordingly, the 2012 and 2011 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The accounting policies used by the segments are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company does not identify or allocate assets, including capital expenditures, by operating segment. Accordingly, assets are not being
reported by segment because the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of performance or making decisions in the allocation of resources.

December31, 2012 and 2011, as well as the interim periods in the six months ended June30, 2013. The Company has reflected in the financial information included in this Note the correction of all identified prior period errors in the
periods in which they originated. The prior period errors relate to:  An adjustment of $08 million for the three months ended June30, 2013 to increase the amount of research services revenue related to recognition
of revenue for the event ticket included in the Companys RoleView and Forrester Leadership Board subscription products. Based on the identification of this error, the Company reassessed its historical calculations and identified a required
change in its methodology for the accounting for an insignificant amount of contract modifications during this period that resulted in an increase decrease to revenue of $01 million and $01 million for the three months ended March31,
2012 and September30, 2012, respectively. The effect of this error has been reflected in deferred revenue in the revised consolidated statement of cash flows presented below.  Adjustments to the Companys share of operating results in one of the technology-related investment funds in which the Company holds an interest,
which adjustments are principally a result of information received by the Company from the fund after the applicable reporting periods. The Company records a portion of the funds operating results, based on the Companys ownership
interest in the fund, as investment gains losses. The adjustments to the gains losses on investments for each period is as follows: $01 million and $01 million for the three months ended March31, 2013 and June30, 2013,
respectively, and $06 million and $01 million for the three months ended September30, 2012 and December31, 2012, respectively. The effect of this error has been reflected in net gains losses from investments in the revised
consolidated statement of cash flows presented below.  Adjustments to revenue for historical insignificant variances in deferred revenue for reconciling items between the Companys general ledger and
sub-ledger system. The increase decrease to revenue for each of the periods is as follows: $01 million, $02 million, $02million and $01 million for the three months ended March31, 2013,June30,
2012,September30, 2012 and December31, 2012, respectively. The effect of this error has been reflected in deferred revenue in the revised consolidated statement of cash flows presented below. Adjustments within the year ended December31, 2012 for the improper capitalization of software development costs during the three months ended
June30, 2012 and September30, 2012. These errors

were corrected in the three months ended December31, 2012 in the previously filed financial statements. The increase decrease in general and administrative expense for each of the periods
is as follows: $02million, $03 million and $05 million for the three months ended June30, 2012,September30, 2012 and December31, 2012, respectively. 
In addition, during the quarter ended December31, 2013, the Company identified certain immaterial prior period errors related to
income taxes that affected the three months ended September30, 2012,December31, 2012 and September30, 2013, as well as the related year-to-date periods. The Company has reflected in the financial information included in this

losses as a result of a settlement of a tax audit at the Companys German subsidiary.  Adjustment of $01 million to increase income tax expense for the three months ended December31, 2012 and an adjustment of $01 million to
decrease income tax expense for the three months ended September30, 2013 to correct for insignificant errors in each of the periods. The effect of these errors has been reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the revised
consolidated statement of cash flows presented below. Revised Consolidated Statements of Income   AsPreviouslyReported Adjustments AsRevised AsPreviouslyReported Adjustments AsRevised Income tax provision 1,813 74 1,739 7,056 74 6,982 Net income 2,435 74

Unresolved Staff Comments We have not received written comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission that remain unresolved.  Item2.
Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule13a-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December31, 2013. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its
inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls
over financial reporting may vary over time. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2013. In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued 1992by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
COSO of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December31, 2013, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on pageF-1 of this Annual Report on Form10-K. Remediation Steps to Address Prior Material Weaknesses As of
September30, 2013, we reported that management had identified a material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting related to the recognition of revenue for event tickets that are included in certain of our
subscription products. In addition, as of December31, 2012, we reported that management had identified a material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting related to revenue for advisory services and consulting
projects. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
We have made the following changes to our internal controls over financial reporting to remediate the previously reported material
weaknesses.

Advisory Services and Consulting Projects 1.
Consulting Project Scoping: During the scoping phase of each project, we ensured that evidence was maintained of the review and approval of the allocation of the
project revenue to the services to be delivered to the client and that the project allocation is accurately entered into our accounting system.  2.
Advisory Services and Consulting Project Performance: Our project managers more closely monitored the performance of each advisory service and consulting project and
maintained evidence of their review and approval of the services performed.  3.
Training: We ensured that we conducted proper training so that the remedial actions identified above were understood and followed by applicable personnel.
Event Tickets Included In Subscription Products 1.
Additional procedures were implemented to reconcile the inputs in the manual calculation to additional data contained in our accounting system. New accounting system
reports were generated to facilitate the reconciliation.  2.
Analytical procedures were implemented and performed by our financial planning and analysis group this group is separate from the accounting group that prepares the
referenced calculations to assess the reasonableness of the amount of event revenue recognized. In the fourth
quarter of 2013, we completed our remediation activities, including the testing of the operating effectiveness of the enhanced controls. As a result, as of December31, 2013, we concluded that we have remediated the previously reported material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
As described above, we completed the remediation plans for the previously identified material weaknesses. These actions constitute changes
in our internal control over financial reporting which occurred during the quarter ended December31, 2013 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
