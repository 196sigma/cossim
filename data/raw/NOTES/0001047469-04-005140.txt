REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS    
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Exelixis,Inc. 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Exelixis,Inc. as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Exelixis,Inc. at December31,
2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. 
As
discussed in Note6 of notes to consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. s/ERNST YOUNG LLP Palo Alto, California

EXELIXIS,INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The Company 
Exelixis,Inc. Exelixis or the Company is a biotechnology company whose primary mission is to develop proprietary human therapeutics by leveraging
its integrated discovery platform to increase the speed, efficiency and quality of pharmaceutical product discovery and development. The Company uses comparative genomics and model system genetics to
find new drug targets that Exelixis believes would be difficult or impossible to uncover using other experimental approaches. The Company research is designed to identify novel genes and proteins
expressed by those genes, that, when changed, either decrease or increase the activity in a specific disease pathway in a therapeutically relevant manner. These genes and proteins represent either
potential product targets or drugs that may treat disease or prevent disease initiation or progression. The Company most advanced proprietary pharmaceutical program focuses on drug discovery and
development of small molecules in cancer. While the Company proprietary programs focus on drug discovery and development, Exelixis believes that its proprietary technologies are valuable to other
industries whose products can be enhanced by an understanding of DNA or proteins, including the agrochemical, agricultural and diagnostic industries. 
Basis of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. 
The
Company records its minority ownership interests in Genoptera LLC and Agrinomics LLC using the equity method of accounting. Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments and Restricted Cash and Investments 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company invests its
excess cash in high-grade, short-term commercial paper and money market funds, which invest in United States U.S. Treasury securities that are subject to minimal credit and
market risk. 
All
short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and therefore carried at fair value. The Company views its
available-for-sale portfolio as available for use in current operations. Accordingly, the Company has classified all investments as short-term, even though the
stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date. As of December31, 2003, approximately $700million in investments with stated maturities between one
and three years were classified as current. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices of the securities. Unrealized gains and
losses on such securities, when material, are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses, net, on available-for-sale securities are
included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale
are included in interest income.

investments in thousands: December31 2003

unrealized gains were $225,000 and $906,000 as of December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Gross unrealized gains and losses have not been shown separately as they were
immaterial. Realized gains amounted to none in 2003, $65,000 in 2002 and $84,000 in 2001. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally three to seven
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease. Equipment held under capital lease is stated at the lower of the cost of
the related asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Repairs and maintenance
costs are charged to expense as incurred. 
50  Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets have been amortized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Developed technology
3 - 5 years Patents/core technology
15 years Assembled workforce 2001
3 years Goodwill 2001
15 years Beginning
in 2002, the Company adopted the rules of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS142. Accordingly, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized and are subject to
annual impairment tests. 
Long-lived Assets 
The Company accounts for its long-lived assets under SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
SFAS144 adopted on January1, 2002. SFAS144 retains the requirements of SFAS121 to recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a
long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate fair
value due to their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans and capital lease obligations with similar terms, the carrying value of the Company debt
obligations approximates fair value. Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
investments in marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of money market funds, taxable commercial paper,
corporate bonds with high credit quality, U.S. government agency obligations and auction rate securities. All cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are maintained with financial
institutions that management believes are creditworthy. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are concentrated in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Accordingly, the Company
may be exposed to credit risk generally associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The Company has incurred no bad debt expense since inception. For
the year ended December31, 2003, revenue from three of the Company collaborators represented approximately 31%, 28% and 21% of total revenue. For the year ended
December31, 2002, revenue from two of the Company collaborators represented approximately 39% and 25% of total revenue. For the year ended December31, 2001, revenue from three of the
Company collaborators represented approximately 32%, 31% and 15% of total revenue. 
51  Revenue Recognition 
License, research commitment and other non-refundable payments received in connection with research collaboration agreements are deferred and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreements, generally the research term. Contract research revenues are recognized as services are performed
pursuant to the terms of the agreements. Any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue. Payments are not refundable if research is not successful. 
Milestone
payments are non-refundable and recognized as revenue over the period of the research arrangement. This typically results in a portion of the milestone being
recognized at the date the milestone is achieved, and the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement. 
Revenues
from chemistry collaborations are generally recognized upon the delivery of accepted compounds. 
Research and Development Expenses 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include costs associated with research performed pursuant to collaborative agreements. Research and
development costs consist of direct and
indirect internal costs related to specific projects as well as fees paid to other entities that conduct certain research activities on behalf of the Company. 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Company manages exposures to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates for its foreign operations through a program of risk management adopted in 2002
that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments solely to hedge identified exposures and by policy prohibits the use of derivative
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets or accrued expenses. The
Company enters into foreign currency exchange combination option contracts denominated in European Union Euro Euro to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on
the cash flows related to the Company payments to one of its German subsidiaries for services provided by the subsidiary. The Company has designated these derivatives as foreign currency cash flow
hedges. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period
during which the hedged transaction impacts earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of the future cash flows of the
hedged item, if any, is recognized in other income or expense in current earnings in each reporting period. If
a cash flow hedge were to be discontinued because it is probable that the original hedged transaction will not occur as anticipated, the unrealized gains or losses would be
reclassified into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument would be recognized in income in each period until the instrument matures, is terminated or is sold. 
During
the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company did not recognize any gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instruments and reclassified a
gain of $271,000 and 
52  227,000,
respectively, from other comprehensive income into earnings under the caption, Research and development expense. During the year ended December31, 2003, the Company settled its
written foreign currency put and call option contracts as a result of the restructuring of its German facilities, which resulted in a loss of approximately $102,000. 
Net Loss Per Share 
Basic and diluted net loss per share are computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period adjusted for shares that are subject to repurchase. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential common stock because their effect is antidilutive. Potential
common stock consists of common stock subject to repurchase, incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants and shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible
promissory note. 
The
following table sets forth potential shares of common stock that are not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would be antidilutive for the year
ended December31, 2003: Options to purchase common stock
10,906,742 Common stock subject to repurchase
12,243 Conversion of note and loan
9,542,231 Warrants
257,053 20,718,269 Foreign Currency Translation 
Exelixis' subsidiaries located in Germany operate primarily using local functional currency. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, and revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are
presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company has employee and director stock option plans that are more fully described in Note10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Company recognizes employee stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25 and related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized in the Company financial statements for the stock options granted to employees, which had an exercise price
equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS123, as amended by SFAS No148,

options vest over several years and additional option grants are expected to be made in future years, the pro forma impact on the results of operations for the three years ended

The
fair value of stock options and shares purchased pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following

Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with, Selling Goods or Services EITF 96-18. Compensation expense for stock
options granted to non-employees has been determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured
and is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest. Comprehensive Income 
Comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss. Other comprehensive income loss includes unrealized gains
and losses on available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges and cumulative translation adjustments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
FIN46. FIN 46 requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity VIE to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant
variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures. A VIE is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest, or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to
finance the entity activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties. For arrangements entered into with VIEs created prior to January31, 2003,
the provisions of FIN46 are required to be adopted at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after March15, 2004. The provisions of FIN46 were effective
immediately for all arrangements entered into with new VIEs created after January31, 2003. 
Exelixis

NOTE 2 ACQUISITIONS 
Genomica Corporation 
On November19, 2001, Exelixis and Genomica Corporation Genomica, a bio-informatics software company, announced a definitive agreement
pursuant to which Exelixis would acquire Genomica in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $1100million. The transaction was structured as an offer for 100% of
Genomica outstanding common stock to be followed by a merger of Genomica with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelixis. On December28, 2001, Exelixis accepted for payment 22,911,969 shares of
Genomica common stock, or 9394% of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock of Genomica. On January8, 2002, the merger of Genomica was completed. Upon effectiveness of the
merger, Genomica became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelixis. The transaction, which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in 2001, was effected through the exchange of 028309 of
a share of Exelixis common stock for each outstanding share of Genomica common stock. A total of approximately 69million shares of Exelixis common stock were issued for all of the outstanding
shares of Genomica common stock. 
The
total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $1100million, which consisted of Exelixis common stock valued at $1089million and estimated Exelixis
transaction costs of $11million. As of December31, 2001, Exelixis had issued only 9394% of the total consideration; accordingly, the Company recorded the value of the remaining
606%, or $69million, as a long-term liability. 
The
purchase price for Genomica was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, as determined by
management based on an independent valuation. As a result of this transaction, Exelixis recorded net tangible assets of $1062million including cash and investments of $1096million,
developed technology of $400,000, which would be amortized over three years, and recorded goodwill of $34million. At the same time, Exelixis recorded a goodwill impairment charge of
$27million, which was expensed in 2001 to
operations. The impairment of goodwill was calculated in accordance with SFAS121 by estimating the present value of future cash flows for the ongoing Genomica licensing business using a risk
adjusted discount rate. The goodwill impairment charge represented excess purchase price that Exelixis viewed as economically equivalent to financing costs for the acquired cash and investments.
Information regarding goodwill is described in further detail in Note6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition in thousands: December 28,
2001 Cash, investments and interest receivable 111,302 Other tangible assets liabilities, net 5,037 Goodwill 3,382 Developed technologies 400 Net assets acquired 110,047 Prior
to the December28, 2001 acquisition date, Exelixis adopted an exit plan for Genomica. Under this exit plan, the Company terminated Genomica entire workforce and abandoned
its leased facilities in Boulder, Colorado and Sacramento, California. The estimated costs of the exit plan 
56  amounted
to $29million, consisted primarily of employee severance and benefits and lease abandonment costs, and were included as part of the liabilities assumed in the acquisition. As of
December31, 2003, the remaining actions to be taken under the exit plan consisted primarily of residual payments of approximately $700,000 related to the lease obligation for the facility in
Boulder, Colorado. 
In
April2002, Exelixis transferred the Genomica software business to Visualize,Inc. Visualize for future consideration of up to $24million in license fees
and royalty payments. Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, Visualize obtained a license with all rights and obligations to third parties currently licensing the Genomica software, including the
sole right to further develop and license the software to other third parties. Exelixis retains an internal use license for the software. Royalties that Exelixis receives, if any, will be recorded in
the period they are earned as a gain from discontinued operations. In addition, Visualize assumed the lease obligation for Genomica abandoned facility in Sacramento, California. As a result of this
transaction, the Company reported the operating results of Genomica and the estimated loss on the sale of Genomica as discontinued operations. For the period beginning January1, 2002 to
Genomica disposal in April2002, Genomica operating results consisted of revenues of approximately $58,000 and an operating loss of approximately $456,000. The Company loss on the sale of
Genomica includes the write-off of remaining goodwill of approximately $971,000, partially offset by a reversal of approximately $176,000 as a result of the assumption of Genomica lease
obligation for the Sacramento, California facility by Visualize. Artemis Pharmaceuticals GmbH 
In May2001, the Company acquired a majority of the outstanding capital stock of Artemis Pharmaceuticals GmbH Artemis, a privately held genetics and
functional genomics company organized under the laws of Germany. The transaction, which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, was effected through the exchange of shares of
Exelixis common stock for Deutschmark 100 of nominal value of Artemis capital stock, using an exchange ratio of 4064 to one. Approximately 16million shares of Exelixis common stock were
issued in exchange for 78% of the outstanding capital stock of Artemis held by Artemis stockholders. In addition, Exelixis received a call option the Call Option from, and issued a put option the
Put Option to, certain stockholders of Artemis the Option Holders for the issuance of approximately 460,000 shares of Exelixis common stock in exchange for the remaining 22% of the outstanding
capital stock of Artemis held by the Option Holders. Exelixis could exercise the Call Option at any time from May14, 2001 through January31, 2002, and the Option Holders could exercise
their rights under the Put Option at any time from April1, 2002 through May15, 2002. Exelixis exercised the Call Option for 131,674 shares and 329,591 shares in December2001
and January2002, respectively, which resulted in an increase to goodwill of approximately $19million and $40million, respectively. In addition, Exelixis issued fully vested
rights to purchase approximately 187,000 additional shares of Exelixis common stock to Artemis employees in exchange for such employees' vested options formerly representing the right to purchase
shares of Artemis capital stock pursuant to the Artemis employee option program. 
The
total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $282million, which consisted of Exelixis common stock and options valued at $273million and Exelixis
transaction costs of $900,000. Exelixis' transaction costs include financial advisory, legal, accounting and other fees. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, as determined by management based upon an independent valuation. 
57  As
a result of this transaction, Exelixis recorded expense associated with the purchase of in-process research and development of $67million, net tangible assets of
$28million and intangible assets including goodwill of $187million, the majority of which was being amortized over 15years until December31, 2001. 
The
valuation of the purchased in-process research and development of $67million was based upon the results of an independent valuation using the income approach for
each of the three significant in-process projects. The in-process projects relate primarily to the development of technologies that use vertebrate genetic model organisms,
zebrafish and mice, to identify and functionally validate novel genes in vivo. These genes can be used as novel screening targets or as the basis for secreted proteins in clinically and commercially
relevant diseases. The in-process projects have been substantially completed. The income approach estimates the value of each acquired in-process project based on its expected
future cash flows. The valuation analysis considered the contribution of the core technology as well as the percent complete of each in-process research and development project. The
expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in-process research and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of 30%, which is considered
commensurate with the overall risk and percent complete of the in-process projects. The purchased in-process research and development was not considered to have reached
technological feasibility, and it has no alternative future use, and accordingly, it was recorded as a component of operating expense. 
The
revenues, expenses, cash flows and other assumptions underlying the estimated fair value of the acquired in-process research and development involve significant risks and
uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties associated with completing the acquired in-process projects include the ability to reach future research milestones since the technologies being
developed are unproven, the ability to retain key personnel, the ability to obtain licenses to key technology and the ability to avoid infringing on patents and propriety rights of third parties. 
Pro Forma Results

NOTE 3 RESEARCH AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS 
Bayer 
In May1998, the Company entered into a six-year research collaboration agreement with Bayer AG including its affiliates, Bayer to identify
novel screening targets for the development of new pesticides for use in crop protection. The Company provided research services directed towards identifying and investigating molecular targets in
insects and nematodes that may be useful in developing and commercializing pesticide products. The Company received a $12million license fee upon execution of the agreement that was deferred
and will be recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement. 
In
December1999, the Company significantly expanded its relationship with Bayer by forming a joint venture in the form of a new limited liability company, Genoptera LLC
Genoptera. Under the terms of the Genoptera operating agreement, Bayer provides 100% of the capital necessary to fund the operations of Genoptera and has the ability to control the entity with a
60% ownership interest. The
Company owns the other 40% interest in Genoptera without making any capital contribution and reports its investment in Genoptera using the equity method of accounting. Bayer initial capital
contributions to Genoptera were $100million in January2000 and another $100million in January2001. Bayer is required to also contribute cash to Genoptera in amounts
necessary to fund its ongoing operating expenses. Genoptera has incurred losses since inception. Since the carrying value of this investment is zero and there is no obligation to fund future losses,
Exelixis has not recorded equity method losses to date for Genoptera. 
In
January2000, the Company, Bayer and Genoptera entered into an exclusive eight-year research collaboration agreement, which superceded the 1998 agreement discussed
above. The Company is required to provide Genoptera with expanded research services focused on developing insecticides and nematicides for crop protection. Under the terms of the collaboration
agreement, Genoptera paid the Company a $100million license fee and a $100million research commitment fee. One-half of these fees were received in January2000,
and the remaining amounts were received in January2001. Additionally, Genoptera is required to pay the Company approximately $100million in annual research funding. The Company can
earn additional payments under the collaboration agreement upon the achievement of certain milestones. The Company can also earn royalties on the future sale by Bayer of pesticide products
incorporating compounds developed against targets and assays under the agreement. The agreement also provides Bayer an exclusive royalty-free option to use certain technology developed
under the agreement in the development of fungicides and herbicides. To the extent permitted under the collaboration agreement, if the Company were to develop and sell certain human health or
agrochemical products that incorporate compounds developed under the agreement, it would be obligated to pay royalties to Genoptera. No such activities are expected for the foreseeable future. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb 
In September1999, the Company entered into a three-year research and technology transfer agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
Bristol-Myers Squibb or BMS to identify the mechanism of action MOA of compounds delivered to the Company by BMS. In July2002, the agreement was extended for an additional two years.
BMS agreed to pay the Company a $250,000 technology access fee, which is being recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is entitled to
receive research funding ranging from $13million in the first year up to as much as $25million annually in future years. The Company can also earn 
59  additional
amounts under the agreement upon the achievement of certain milestones as well as earn royalties on the future sale by BMS of human products incorporating compounds developed under the
agreement. The agreement also includes technology transfer and licensing terms, which call for BMS and the Company to license and share certain core technologies in genomics and lead optimization. 
In
July2001, the Company and BMS entered into a collaboration involving three agreements: aa Stock Purchase Agreement; ba Cancer Collaboration Agreement; and
ca License Agreement. Under the
terms of the collaboration, BMS ipurchased 600,600 shares of Exelixis common stock in a private placement at a purchase price of $3330 per share, for cash proceeds to Exelixis of
approximately $200million; iiagreed to pay Exelixis a $50million upfront license fee and provide Exelixis with $30million per year in research funding for a
minimum of three years; and iiigranted to Exelixis a worldwide, fully-paid, exclusive license to the rebeccamycin analogue developed by BMS, for which the Company is currently
undertaking activities leading to the planned initiation of a Phase 3 trial as a potential treatment for bile duct tumors. Due to risk and uncertainties with Rebeccamycin, and because the analogue had
not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative use, the analogue was assigned no value for financial reporting purposes. The premium in excess of fair market value of
$100million paid for the common stock purchased by BMS is being accounted for similar to an upfront license fee and is being recognized ratably over the life of the contract. 
In
December2003, this collaboration was extended until January2007, with the right for BMS to continue the collaboration until July2009. The goal of the extension
is to increase the total number and degree of validation of cancer targets that Exelixis will deliver to Bristol-Myers Squibb. Each company will maintain the option to obtain exclusive worldwide
rights to equal numbers of validated targets arising from the collaboration. Under the terms of the extended collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb provided Exelixis with an upfront payment and will
provide increased annual research funding and milestones on certain cancer targets arising from the collaboration that progress through specified stages of validation. Exelixis will also be entitled
to receive milestones on compounds in the event of successful clinical and regulatory events and royalties on commercialized products. SmithKlineBeecham Corporation/GlaxoSmithKline plc 
In October2002, Exelixis and SmithKlineBeecham Corporation GSK established a collaboration to discover and develop novel therapeutics in the areas of
vascular biology, inflammatory disease and oncology. The collaboration involved three agreements: aa Product Development and Commercialization Agreement; ba Stock Purchase and
Stock Issuance Agreement; and ca Loan and Security Agreement. Under the terms of the Product Development and Commercialization Agreement, GSK has paid the Company $300million in an
upfront fee and $100million in annual research funding, and has agreed to pay a minimum of an additional $800million in research and development funding over the first six years of
the collaboration. 
Under
the terms of the Stock Purchase and Stock Issuance Agreement, GSK purchased two million shares of Exelixis' common stock in a private placement at a purchase price of $700 per
share, which represented a premium of approximately 100% to the stock price on the effective date of the agreements. The Company received cash proceeds of approximately $140million for the
purchase of these shares. Exelixis has the option to sell additional common shares to GSK in the future. 
Under
the Loan and Security Agreement, GSK provided a loan facility of up to $850million for use in the Company efforts under the collaboration, and the Company borrowed
$250million under 
60  that
agreement in December2002 and an additional $300million in December2003. All loan amounts bear interest at a rate of 4% per annum and are secured by the intellectual
property, technology and equipment created or utilized pursuant to the collaboration. Principal and accrued interest become due in installments, beginning on or about the sixth anniversary of the
collaboration, unless the collaboration is earlier terminated by GSK. Repayment of all or any of the amounts advanced to the Company under this agreement may, at the Company election, be in the form
of Exelixis' common stock at fair market value, subject to certain conditions. The
upfront fee and the premium portion of the equity purchase have been deferred and are being recognized as revenue over the development term. Exelixis may also receive clinical and
developmental payments based on the number and timing of compounds reaching specified milestones. Two years from the start of the collaboration, GSK may elect to expand the collaboration; under this
option, Exelixis' milestone payments could double, and the development funding and the loan facility would also be significantly expanded. 
Dow AgroSciences 
In July2000, the Company entered into a three-year research collaboration with Dow AgroSciences LLC Dow AgroSciences to identify the MOA
of herbicides and fungicides delivered to it under this agreement. The identity and function of these compounds are not known to the Company prior to their delivery. 
Under
this agreement, the Company receives access to a collection of proprietary compounds from Dow AgroSciences that may be useful in the Company human therapeutic drug discovery
programs. 
The
Company is required to identify and validate targets and format assays to be used by Dow AgroSciences to develop new classes of fungicides and herbicides. Dow AgroSciences will pay
the Company research support fees, milestone payments and royalties based on achievements in the research and commercialization of any resultant new products. This collaboration was extended for an
additional year in August2003. 
Protein Design Labs 
On May22, 2001, the Company and Protein Design Labs,Inc. PDL entered into a two-year collaboration to discover and
develop humanized antibodies for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cancer. The collaboration utilized Exelixis' model organism genetics technology for the identification of new cancer drug
targets and PDL antibody and clinical development expertise to create and develop new antibody drug candidates. This collaboration was successfully completed on schedule in
May2003. Under the terms of the collaboration, PDL provided Exelixis with $40million in annual research funding until May2003 and purchased a $300million convertible
note. The note bears interest at 575%, and the interest thereon is payable annually. The note is convertible at PDL option any time after the first anniversary of the note
issuance. The note is convertible into Exelixis common stock at a conversion price per share equal to the lower of i$28175 or ii110% of the Fair Market Value as defined in the
note of a share of Exelixis common stock at the time of conversion. 
61  Agrinomics 
In July1999, Exelixis Plant Sciences formerly Agritope,Inc. and Bayer CropScience formerly Aventis CropScience USA LP formed Agrinomics LLC to
conduct a research, development and commercialization program in the field of agricultural functional genomics. As a result of the Company acquisition of Exelixis Plant Sciences, the Company owns a
50% interest in Agrinomics, while Bayer CropScience owns the remaining 50% interest. Bayer CropScience has agreed to make capital contributions to Agrinomics in cash totaling $200million over
a five-year period, of which $170million has been contributed to date. Exelixis Plant Sciences contributed certain technology and a collection of seeds generated using such
technology. In connection with the Company acquisition of Exelixis Plant Sciences, no portion of the purchase price was assigned to Agrinomics. Although the Company is required to account for its
investment in Agrinomics under the equity method, the Company does not expect to include in its consolidated financial statements a proportionate share of the losses of Agrinomics until such time, if
ever, that the Company makes a capital contribution to Agrinomics. There is no requirement for the Company to make capital contributions to Agrinomics. 
In
December2002, Agrinomics established an alliance to enhance seed oil content in commercially valuable crops with Renessen LLC. Renessen is a joint venture between Monsanto
Company and Cargill,Inc. The collaboration combines Agrinomics' technological leadership in agricultural functional genomics, high-throughput gene screening and seed trait
identification, developed at Exelixis Plant Sciences, with Renessen global expertise in quality trait crop development and commercialization, with the goal of accelerating the development of novel
proprietary crops with improved seed composition traits. This collaboration leverages the unique capabilities of Agrinomics' powerful ACTTAG gene activation and selection platform to
rapidly discover and validate genes that can optimize important seed traits in order to increase the commercial value of
many of the world most significant agricultural crops. Under the terms of the collaboration, Renessen will provide Agrinomics with committed annual research funding ranging from $13million
in the first year up to as much as $20million annually in future years, in addition to payments for the selection of genes and other product options. Agrinomics can also earn additional
amounts under the agreement upon the achievement of certain milestones, as well as royalties on commercialized products that may emerge from the collaboration. In addition, Renessen will contribute
research and product development capabilities in taking gene candidates identified by Agrinomics into crop products that include leading commercial germplasm. 
Pharmacia 
In February1999, the Company entered into a research collaboration agreement with Pharmacia Corporation Pharmacia focused on the identification of
novel targets that may be useful in the development of pharmaceutical products in the areas of Alzheimer disease and metabolic syndrome. Pharmacia agreed to pay the Company a $50million
non-refundable license fee, which was being recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, as expanded and amended in October1999, the
Company also received an obligation from Pharmacia to provide future research funding. In July2001, the Company announced the reacquisition, effective February2002, of future rights to
the research programs. Pharmacia retained rights to targets under the existing agreement selected prior to the reacquisition date, subject to the payment of milestones for certain of those targets
selected and royalties for future development of products against or using those targets. Pharmacia will have no other obligations to make payments to the Company, including 
62  approximately
$90million in annual funding that would have otherwise been payable for an additional two years if the Company had not elected to reacquire rights to the research. As a result
of this transaction, revenue recognition of upfront license fees and milestone payments was accelerated over the remaining term of the agreement. Compound Collaborations 
The Company entered into collaboration agreements with Cytokinetics,Inc., Elan Pharmaceuticals,Inc., Schering-Plough Research
Institute,Inc. and SciosInc. in 2001 and Merck Co.,Inc. in 2002, to jointly design custom high-throughput screening compound libraries that Exelixis will
synthesize and qualify. Each company is required to pay Exelixis a per-compound fee and has paid an upfront technology access fee that is creditable towards the future purchase of
compounds. The upfront fees are initially deferred. Revenues under these collaboration agreements are generally recognized upon delivery of the accepted compounds. Each party retains the rights to use
the compounds in its own unique drug discovery programs and in its collaborative efforts with third parties. 
NOTE 4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Company had outstanding loans aggregating $221,000 and $904,000 to certain officers and employees at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
notes are general recourse or collateralized by certain real property assets, bear interest at rates ranging from 46% to 70% and have maturities through 2006. The principal plus accrued interest
will be forgiven at various rates over three to four years from the employees' date of employment with Exelixis. If an employee leaves Exelixis, all unpaid and unforgiven principal and interest will
be due and payable within 60days. 
As
of December31, 2003, the Company also had outstanding loans aggregating $53,000 to its stockholders. The loans were issued to enable certain non-officer employees
to purchase stock pursuant to their employee stock options. The loans bear interest at a rate of 650% and mature at various times through February2004. 
For
the years ended, December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized revenues of $138million, $136million and $131million, respectively, under
a collaboration agreement with Bayer through the Company joint venture with Genoptera. For
the year ended, December31, 2001, the Company recognized revenue of $38million under a collaboration agreement with Bayer through the Company joint venture with
Agrinomics. The Company recognized revenues of $24million and $38million under the Agrinomics joint venture for the years ended, December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

NOTE 6 GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES 
On January1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS142, which addresses the financial
accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. This accounting standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, and instead, be
tested for impairment on a periodic basis. 
In
accordance with SFAS142, the Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective January1, 2002. In addition, the Company re-characterized any
unamortized acquired assembled workforce as goodwill because it is no longer defined as an acquired intangible asset under SFAS No141, Business Combinations. Accordingly, no goodwill or
acquired workforce amortization was recognized during the year ended December31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS142 also required the completion of a transitional impairment test within
12months of adoption, with any impairment treated as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the transitional impairment
test, which did not result in impairment of recorded goodwill. 
The
Company adopted an annual goodwill impairment test date as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2002. Following this approach, the Company monitors asset-carrying values as of
October1 to assess if there is a potential impairment and complete the measurement of impairment, if required. The Company will perform the impairment measurement procedures under
SFAS142 if it determines that a potential impairment of goodwill exists. The Company completed the annual impairment test as of October1, 2002 and 2003, which did not result in
impairment of recorded goodwill.

2003 
During the third quarter of 2003, the Company implemented a worldwide restructuring of its research and development organization designed to reallocate resources
and enhance the efficiency of its operations. The restructuring includes a reduction in force of 61 research personnel located in South San Francisco, California and Tbingen, Germany,
closure of the Company Tbingen location and relocation of certain research activities and employees from Tbingen to South San Francisco. The reduction in force is
expected to conclude in the first quarter of2004. 
In
connection with the restructuring plan, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $925,000 during the year ended December31, 2003 in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS146. This charge consisted primarily of severance, retention bonuses
and legal and outplacement services fees. The current balance of the liability is included in Other Accrued Expenses on the balance sheet and is summarized in the following table in thousands: Restructuring

December 31, 2003 Severance and benefits 740 367 16 389 Legal and other fees 185 161 24 925 528 16 413 The
Company expects to record additional expenses related to this restructuring plan of approximately $13million through the first quarter of 2004 excluding the currency
translation adjustment described below. The estimated additional expenses consist primarily of severance, retention bonuses, legal and outplacement services as well as expenses related to exiting
contractual commitments at the Tbingen location. This estimate is subject to change depending upon the settlement of contractual commitments related to the Tbingen
location, the changes in the Euro exchange rate, and other factors. Upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the Tbingen location, the 
66 
cumulative
translation adjustment attributable to that entity is expected to be removed from equity and reported as part of the gain or loss on liquidation of the subsidiary. 
As
a result of the restructuring plan described above and the closure of the Tubingen, Germany location and negotiations regarding contractual commitments, the Company accelerated
depreciation expense on certain lab equipment, office equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements with a value of approximately $583,000 to completely write off those assets by the anticipated
facility closure date in January2004. The accelerated depreciation was $394,000 during the year ended December31, 2003. 
2002
