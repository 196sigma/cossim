Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm 
To the Board of
Directors and Stockholders of SIGA Technologies, Inc.: 
In our opinion, the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements
of operations, of changes in stockholders' equity and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SIGA Technologies,
Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31,
2009 and December 31, 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2009 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Company management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements and on the Company internal control over financial
reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
As discussed in Note
2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2009, the
Company changed the way certain financial instruments that are settled in the
Company common stock are accounted for. 
A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SIGA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Organization and Basis of Presentation 
OrganizationSIGA Technologies, Inc.
SIGA or the Company is a bio-defense company engaged in the discovery,
development and commercialization of products for use in defense against
biological warfare agents such as smallpox and arenaviruses. The Company is also
engaged in the discovery and development of other novel anti-infectives,
vaccines, and antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of serious infectious
diseases. The Companys anti-viral programs are designed to prevent or limit the
replication of viral pathogens. SIGAs anti-infectives programs target the
increasingly serious problem of drug resistant bacteria and emerging
pathogens.
Basis of presentationThe accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that the
Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal
course of business. The Company has incurred cumulative net losses and expects
to incur additional losses to perform further research and development
activities. The Company does not have commercial products and has limited
capital resources. Managements plans with regard to these matters include
continued development of its products as well as seeking additional capital
through a combination of collaborative agreements, strategic alliances, research
grants, and future equity and debt financing. Although management will continue
to pursue these plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful
in obtaining future financing on commercially reasonable terms or that the
Company will be able to secure funding from anticipated government contracts and
grants.
Management believes that existing funds
combined with cash flows primarily from continuing government grants and
contracts will be sufficient to support its operations for at least 12 months.
The success of the Company is dependent upon commercializing its research and
development programs and the Companys ability to obtain adequate future
financing. If the Company is unable to raise adequate capital and/or achieve
profitable operations, future operations might need to be scaled back or
discontinued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability of the carrying amount of recorded assets and liabilities
that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Use of EstimatesThe consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management is
required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period
reported. These estimates include the realization of deferred tax assets, useful
lives and impairment of goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets, and the
value of options and warrants granted or issued by the Company. Estimates and
assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected
in the financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting
PrinciplesOn January 1, 2009, the
Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in
Entitys Own Equity ASC
815-40. In accordance with ASC 815-40, the cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle recorded by SIGA in connection with certain warrants to
acquire shares of the Companys common stock see Note 3, was recognized by
SIGA as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as
summarized in the following table:

Cash equivalents and short-term investmentsCash and cash equivalents consist
primarily of cash in banks and highly liquid investments with original
maturities of 90 days or less.
Highly liquid investments with
maturities greater than 90 days and less than one year are classified as
short-term investments. Such investments are generally money market funds, bank
certificates of deposit, and U.S. Treasury bills.
As of December 31, 2009 the
Companys short-term investments consisted of approximately $50 million
invested in United States Treasury Bills with a maturity date of April 1, 2010.
The Company classified this investment as available for sale. As of December 31,
2009 the unrealized gain relating to this investment was
immaterial.
Concentration of credit riskThe Company has cash in bank
accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits.
The Company has not experienced any losses on its cash accounts. No allowance
has been provided for potential credit losses because management believes that
any such losses would be minimal. The Companys accounts payable consist of
trade payables due to creditors.
Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various asset
classes. Estimated lives are 5 years for laboratory equipment; 3 years for
computer equipment; 7 years for furniture and fixtures; and the life of the
lease for leasehold improvements. Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements
are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the
cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Balance Sheet and
any gain or loss is reflected in the Statement of Operations. For the years
ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 accumulated depreciation was $45 million and
$41 million, respectively. 
Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue from
contract research and development and research payments in accordance with FASB
ASC 605 Revenue Recognition ASC 605. In
accordance with ASC 605, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable,
collectability is reasonably assured, contractual obligations have been
satisfied and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer. The
Company recognizes revenue from non-refundable up-front payments, not tied to
achieving a specific performance milestone, over the period which the Company is
obligated to perform services or based on the percentage of costs incurred to
date, estimated costs to complete and total expected contract revenue. Payments
for development activities are recognized as revenue as earned, over the period
of effort. Substantive at-risk milestone payments, which are based on achieving
a specific performance milestone, are recognized as revenue when the milestone
is achieved and the related payment is due, providing there is no future service
obligation associated with that milestone. In situations in which the Company
receives payment in advance of the performance of services, such amounts are
deferred and recognized as revenue as the related services are performed.
For the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008, and 2007, revenues from National Institutes of Health NIH
contracts and grants was 100%, 995%, and 71%, respectively, of total revenues
recognized by the Company. 
Accounts ReceivableAccounts receivable are recorded net
of provisions for doubtful accounts. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, 100% and
92%, respectively, of accounts receivables represented receivables from NIH. An
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific analysis of the
receivables. At December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company had no allowance
for doubtful accounts.
46 
Research and developmentResearch and development expenses
include costs directly attributable to the conduct of research and development
programs, including employee related costs, materials, supplies, depreciation on
and maintenance of research equipment, the cost of services provided by outside
contractors, and facility costs, such as rent, utilities, and general support
services. All costs associated with research and development are expensed as
incurred. Costs related to the acquisition of technology rights, for which
development work is still in process, and that have no alternative future uses,
are expensed as incurred.
GoodwillGoodwill is recorded
when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value
of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired.
The Company evaluates goodwill for
impairment annually, in the fourth quarter of each year. In addition, the
Company would test goodwill for recoverability between annual evaluations
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts
may not be recoverable. Examples of such events could include a significant
adverse change in legal matters, liquidity or in the business climate, an
adverse action or assessment by a regulator or government organization, loss of
key personnel, or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is
more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a reporting
unit. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step approach in accordance
with FASB ASC 350-20 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Goodwill. The impairment review process compares the
fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying
value. The Company operates as one business and one reporting unit. Therefore,
the goodwill impairment analysis was performed on the basis of the Company as a
whole using the market capitalization of the Company as an estimate of its fair
value.
Income taxesIncome taxes are
accounted for under the asset and liability method prescribed by FASB ASC 740
Income Taxes ASC 740. Deferred income taxes are recorded for
temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the
tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than
not that some or the entire deferred tax asset will not be
realized.
The Company applies the provisions
of ASC 740 which prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in which a
company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial
statements all material uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or
expects to take on a tax return.
The Company has no tax positions for
which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax
benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months from
December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the only tax jurisdiction to which
the Company is subject is the United States. Open tax years relate to years in
which unused net operating losses were generated. Thus, the Companys open tax
years extend back to 1995. In the event that the Company concludes that it is
subject to interest and/or penalties arising from uncertain tax positions, the
Company will present interest and penalties as a component of income taxes. No
amounts of interest or penalties were recognized in the Companys Consolidated
Financial Statements as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and for each of the years
in the three year period ended December 31, 2009. 
Net loss per common shareThe Company computes, presents and
discloses earnings per share in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings Per Share
EPS which specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure
requirements for earnings per share of entities with publicly held common stock
or potential common stock. The statement defines two earnings per share
calculations, basic and diluted. The objective of basic EPS is to measure the
performance of an entity over the reporting period by dividing income loss by
the weighted average shares outstanding. The objective of diluted EPS is
consistent with that of basic EPS, that is to measure the performance of an
entity over the reporting period, while giving effect to all dilutive potential
common shares that were outstanding during the period. The calculation of
diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS except the denominator is increased for the
conversion of potential common shares unless the impact of such common shares is
anti-dilutive.
47 
The Company incurred losses for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, and as a result, certain equity
instruments are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share. At
December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, outstanding options to purchase 6,249,917,
7,696,054, and 8,159,768, shares, respectively, of the Companys common stock
with exercise prices ranging from $094 to $932 have been excluded from the
computation of diluted loss per share as the effect of such shares is
anti-dilutive. At December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, outstanding warrants to
purchase 4,301,752, 6,825,567, and 8,262,377, shares, respectively, of the
Companys common stock, with exercise prices ranging from $118 to $499 have
been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as they are
anti-dilutive.
Fair value of financial instruments 
The carrying value of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due
to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. Common stock warrants
which are classified as liabilities under the provisions of FASB ASC 815
Derivatives and Hedging ASC
815, are recorded at
their fair market value as of each reporting period. 
The Company applies FASB ASC 820
Fair value Measurements and Disclosures ASC
820 for financial assets
and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value, and
non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at
fair value on a recurring basis.
ASC 820 provides that the
measurement of fair value requires the use of techniques based on observable and
unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from
independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions.
The inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: 
Level 1 Quoted
prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 Quoted prices for similar
instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations where
inputs are observable or where significant value drivers are
observable.
Level 3 Instruments where significant value
drivers are unobservable to third parties.
SIGA uses model-derived valuations
where inputs are observable in active markets to determine the fair value of
certain common stock warrants on a recurring basis and classify such warrants in
Level 2. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the fair value of such
warrants was as follows: 
December 31,
December 31,
2009
2008

ASC 820 applies to non-financial
assets and non-financial liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis and was
effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the
Company in 2009. 
As of December 31, 2009, the Company
held approximately $50 million in United States Treasury Bills, classified as a
Level 1 security. SIGA does not hold any Level 3 securities.
Share-based CompensationThe Company accounts for its
stock-based compensation programs under the provisions of FASB ASC 718
Compensation Stock
Compensation ASC 718,
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee
stock options and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values. ASC
718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the
grant date using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award
that is ultimately expected to vest is recorded as expense over the requisite
service periods in the Companys consolidated statement of operations.
48 
Segment informationThe Company is managed and operated
as one business. The entire business is managed by a single management team that
reports to the chief executive officer. The Company does not operate separate
lines of business or separate business entities with respect to any of its
product candidates. Accordingly, the Company does not prepare discrete financial
information with respect to separate product areas or by location and only has
one reportable segment as defined by ASC 280 - Segment Reporting.
Recent accounting pronouncementsIn September 2009, the FASB issued
ASU 2009-13, Multiple Element Arrangements ASU 2009-13. ASU 2009-13
addresses the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a
multiple arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. ASU 2009-13
also modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated
across separately identified deliverables and establishes definitions for
determining fair value of elements in an arrangement. This standard must be
adopted by us for new arrangements and material modifications to existing
arrangements no later than January 1, 2011 with earlier adoption permitted. We
are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this standard update will have
on our consolidated financial statements. 
3. Research Agreements 
On September 23, 2009, the Company
was awarded a two-year, $17 million grant from the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID of the NIH, to support the development
of broad spectrum, small-molecule inhibitors of bunyaviruses. The grant was
awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. 
In September 2009, SIGA received a
three-year, $30 million Phase II grant from the NIH to fund the continued
development of ST-246 treatment of smallpox vaccine-related adverse
events.
Effective September 1, 2008, the
Company was awarded a five-year, $550 million contract from the NIAID to
support the development of additional formulations and smallpox-related
indications for ST-246, the Companys lead smallpox drug candidate.
In September 2008, SIGA was awarded
$200 million from the NIAID in supplemental funding to the Companys existing
$165 million contract, to accelerate process development related to large-scale
manufacturing and packaging of ST-246 and commercial-scale validation. The term
of the contract was extended through September 28, 2011. On December 31, 2008,
the Companys prepaid expenses included a deposit of $125 million paid to a
third party for the manufacturing of ST-246 for testing. In connection with the
deposit, and the receipt of reimbursement from the NIAID for such deposit, the
Company also recorded the corresponding deferred revenue. The amount recorded as
prepaid expense will be recognized as operating expense as the related
manufacturing takes place, and revenue will be recognized over the same period.
In September 2008, SIGA received a
two-year, $10 million Phase I grant from the NIH to fund lead optimization and
animal efficacy trials for the Companys Dengue antiviral program. 
In September 2007, we received a
two-year grant for a total of approximately $600,000 supporting our development
of ST-246 treatment of smallpox vaccine-related adverse events. In July 2007,
we were awarded a two-year grant for a total of $530,000 to support our Strep
program. 
4. Stockholders Equity 
On December 31, 2009, the Company
authorized share capital consisted of 110,000,000 shares, of which 100,000,000
are designated common shares and 10,000,000 are designated preferred shares. The
Company Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred shares in series
with rights, privileges and qualifications of each series determined by the
Board.

2009
FinancingOn December 9, 2009, the Company
entered into Subscription Agreements for the sale of 2,725,339 shares of the
Companys common stock, par value $00001 per share, at a purchase price of
$735 per share. Net proceeds to the Company were approximately $186 million.
2008 FinancingOn June 19, 2008, SIGA entered into
a letter agreement the Letter Agreement, with MacAndrews Forbes, LLC
MF, a related party, for MFs commitment to invest the
Investment Commitment, at SIGAs discretion, up to $8 million over a one-year
period the Investment Period in exchange for i SIGA common stock at per
share price equal to the lesser of A $306 or B the average of the
volume-weighted average price per share for the 5 trading days immediately
preceding each funding date, and ii warrants to purchase 40% of the number of
SIGA shares acquired by MF, exercisable at 115% of the common stock
purchase price on such funding date the Consideration Warrants. The
Consideration Warrants will be exercisable for up to 4 years following the
issuance of such warrants. MF has the option, during the Investment Period,
to invest in the Company under the same investment terms the Investment
Option.
On April 29, 2009, SIGA and MF
entered into a letter agreement the Extension Agreement extending the
Investment Period of the Companys Letter Agreement with MF through June
19, 2010 and increasing the number of draws pursuant to the Investment
Commitment and the Investment Option to no more than six. On April 30, 2009 the
Company issued MF 490,196 shares of common stock and 196,078 warrants to
acquire common stock in exchange for total proceeds of $15 million. The
warrants are exercisable until April 30, 2013, for an exercise price of $3519
per share. On September 17, 2009 the Company issued MF 326,797 shares of
common stock and 130,719 warrants to acquire common stock in exchange for total
proceeds of $10 million. The warrants are exercisable until September 17, 2013,
for an exercise price of $3519 per share. As of December 31, 2009, $55 million
of the commitment remains outstanding. 
In addition and in consideration for
the commitment of MF, on June 19, 2008, MF received warrants to
purchase 238,000 shares of SIGA common stock, exercisable at $306 the
Commitment Warrants. The Commitment Warrants are exercisable until June 19,
2012. The Company initially recorded all costs related to the Letter Agreement,
including the fair value of the Commitment Warrants, as deferred transaction
costs. Upon the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of
common stock on April 30, 2009, the Company recorded a reduction in its
additional paid-in capital for the effect of the related transaction
costs.
On January 1, 2009, the Company
adopted ASC 815. In accordance with the provisions ASC 815, the warrants
issuable to MF under the Letter Agreement, which if issued, could be
exercised either by payment of cash or cashless exercise, would no longer be
considered indexed to the Companys own stock and therefore would be subject
to the scope of ASC 815. As a result, such warrants meet the definition of a
derivative and must be recorded on the Company balance sheet. The Company
applied the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of the respective
derivative instruments using the Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the price of
the Companys common stock on the derivatives expiration date. The expected
volatility was estimated using the Companys historical volatility. On January
1, 2009, the Company recorded the fair value of the warrants, or $27 million,
as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. The Company
recorded a loss of $23 million, or $05 per share, for the year ended December
31, 2009 representing the increase in the fair value of the warrants from
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009.

2006
and 2005 Placements
In 2006 and 2005 the Company sold
shares of SIGA common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. As
of December 31, 2009, 1,000,000 warrants issued in 2006 with an initial exercise
price of $499 per share and 579,192 warrants issued in 2005 with an initial
exercise price of $118 per share were outstanding. These warrants may be
exercised through and including the seventh anniversary of their respective
closing date.
The Company accounted for the
transactions under the provisions of ASC 815 which requires that free-standing
derivative financial instruments that require net cash settlement be classified
as assets or liabilities at the time of the transaction, and recorded at their
fair value. ASC 815 also requires that any changes in the fair value of the
derivative instruments be reported in earnings or loss as long as the derivative
contracts are classified as assets or liabilities. At December 31, 2009, the
fair market value of the warrants issued in 2006 and 2005 was $36 million and
$28 million, respectively. The Company applied the Black-Scholes model to
calculate the fair values of the respective derivative instruments using the
contracted term of the warrants. Management estimates the expected volatility
using a combination of the Companys historical volatility and the volatility of
a group of comparable companies. For the year ended December 31, 2009, SIGA
recorded a loss of $34 million as a result of a net increase in the 2005 and
2006 placement warrants fair value. 
5. Stock option plan and warrants
Amended and Restated 1996 Incentive and
Non-Qualified Stock Option PlanIn January 1996, the Company
implemented its 1996 Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan the Plan.
The Plan as amended provides for the granting of up to 11,000,000 shares of the
Companys common stock to employees, consultants and outside directors of the
Company. The exercise period for options granted under the Plan, except those
granted to outside directors, is determined by a committee of the Board of
Directors. Stock options granted to outside directors pursuant to the Plan must
have an exercise price equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the
Companys common stock at the date of grant. 
51 
For the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008, and 2007 the Company recorded compensation expense of $21 million 10 million, and $571,000 respectively, related to stock options. The total
fair value of options vested during each year was $14 million, $595,000, and
$315,000 for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The total compensation cost not
yet recognized related to non-vested awards at December 31, 2009 is $19
million. The weighted average period over which total compensation cost is
expected to be recognized is 167 years. 
SIGA calculated the fair value of
options awarded during the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007
using the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions

The Company calculates the expected
volatility using a combination of SIGAs historical volatility and the
volatility of a group of comparable companies. The risk-free interest rate
assumption is based upon observed interest rate appropriate for the term of the
Companys employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the
Companys intent not to issue a dividend in the foreseeable future. The expected
holding period assumption was estimated based on historical experience and
expectation of employee exercise behavior in the future giving consideration to
the contractual terms of the award.

9. Income Taxes 
The Company has incurred losses
since inception, which have generated net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $520 million at December 31, 2009 for federal and state income
tax purposes. These carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income
and begin expiring in 2010 for federal income tax purposes. As a result of a
previous change in stock ownership, the annual utilization of the net operating
loss carryforwards is subject to limitation. The net operating loss
carryforwards and temporary differences, arising primarily from deferred
research and development expenses and differences in the treatment of intangible
assets, result in a noncurrent deferred tax asset at December 31, 2009 and 2008
of approximately $283 and $245 million, respectively. In consideration of the
Companys accumulated losses and the uncertainty of its ability to utilize this
deferred tax asset in the future, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance
of an equal amount on such date to fully offset the deferred tax asset.
At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
Companys deferred tax assets in thousands are comprised of the following

differences for which no benefit was recorded, state taxes and other permanent
differences.

OtherIn December 2006, PharmAthene, Inc.
PharmAthene filed an action against us in the Delaware Court of Chancery,
captioned PharmAthene, Inc. v. SIGA Technologies,
Inc., C.A. No. 2627-N. In
its amended complaint, PharmAthene asks the Court to order us to enter into a
license agreement with PharmAthene with respect to ST-246, as well as issue a
declaration that we are obliged to execute such a license agreement, and award
damages resulting from our supposed breach of that obligation. PharmAthene also
alleges that we breached an obligation to negotiate such a license agreement in
good faith, as well as seeks damages for promissory estoppel and unjust
enrichment based on supposed information, capital and assistance that
PharmAthene allegedly provided to us during the negotiation process. In January
2008, the Court of Chancery denied our motion to dismiss the original complaint
and discovery proceeded. In May 2009, PharmAthene amended its complaint with
respect to its claim for breach of an obligation to negotiate in good faith, and
we filed our answer to the amended complaint and counterclaim denying the new
claim and asserting defenses.
PharmAthene has submitted an expert report
asserting several alternative theories of damages, including amounts in a wide
range of up to one billion dollars. We believe that the experts damages
analyses are flawed and methodologically unsound. We also continue to believe
that we have meritorious defenses to the claims. No trial date has been set. It
is not currently possible to estimate a range of loss, if any.

From time to time, the Company is
involved in disputes or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. The Company believes that there is no other dispute or litigation
pending that could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Item 5. Controls and Procedures
Managements Responsibility for
Financial StatementsOur management is responsible for the
integrity and objectivity of all information presented in this annual report.
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
include amounts based on managements best estimates and judgments. Management
believes the consolidated financial statements fairly reflect the form and
substance of transactions and that the financial statements fairly represent the
Companys financial position and results of operations. 
Disclosure Controls and
ProceduresWe have established disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who
certify the Companys financial reports and to other members of senior
management and the Board of Directors. Based on their evaluation as of December
31, 2009, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded
that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules
13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management, including its chief executive office and chief financial
officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Managements Report on Internal
Control over Financial
ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15f or Rule 15d-15f of the Exchange Act. Our internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that a pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and disposition of the Companys assets; b provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and c
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. 
Management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009 based on the framework set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that the Company internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2009. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included in this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over
Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
control over financial reporting.
