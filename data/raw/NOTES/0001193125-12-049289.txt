REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Vitran Corporation Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vitran Corporation Inc. as of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income loss,
shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule
included in a2 of Form 10-K. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Vitran Corporation Inc.s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits

Description of the business: 
Vitran Corporation Inc. Vitran or the Company is a North American provider of freight services and distribution
solutions to a wide variety of companies and industries. Vitran offers less-than-truckload LTL service throughout Canada and the United States. Vitrans supply chain operation SCO offers logistics solutions in Canada
and the United States, including warehousing, inventory management and flow-through distribution facilities, as well as freight brokerage services.  b
Basis of presentation: These
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
GAAP. Canadian Securities regulations allow issuers that are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States to file financial statements under United States GAAP to meet their continuous
disclosure obligations in Canada. All amounts in these consolidated financial statements are expressed in United States dollars, unless otherwise stated.  c
New accounting pronouncements: 
FASB Accounting Standard Update ASU No2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, permits entities to first assess
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. FASB
ASU No2011-08 will be adopted by the Company on January1, 2012. FASB ASU No2011-05, Presentation of
Comprehensive Income, requires entities to present net income and comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and comprehensive income. FASB has amended FASB ASU
No2011-05 with FASB ASU No2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards No2011-05, which defers the
effective date of certain requirements outlined in FASB ASU No2011-05 until further deliberated and reinstates the requirements for presentation of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income that were in place before the
issuance of FASB ASU No2011-05. FASB ASU No2011-05 will be adopted by the Company on January1, 2012. FASB
ASU No2010-06, Improving Disclosure about Fair Value Measurements, requires enhanced disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair-value measurements including significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value
measurements and information on purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis for Level 3 fair-value measurements. FASB ASU No2010-06 was adopted January1, 2010 except for the requirement to separately disclose purchases,
sales, issuances and settlements of recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, which was adopted January1, 2011.

Foreign currency translation: A
majority of the Companys shareholders, customers and industry analysts are located in the United States. Accordingly, the Company has adopted the United States dollar as its reporting currency. 
The United States dollar is the functional currency of the Companys operations in the United States. The Canadian dollar is the
functional currency of the Companys Canadian operations. Each operation translates foreign currency-denominated
transactions into its functional currency using the rate of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency of the operation using the year-end rate of exchange giving rise to a gain or loss that is recognized in income during the current year. 
The revaluation of United States dollar denominated debt held by the parent entity with a Canadian functional currency, that hedges the
net investment in the Companys United States dollar denominated self-sustaining subsidiaries, is recorded to other comprehensive income. In a hedge of a net investment in self-sustaining foreign subsidiaries, the portion of the gain or loss on
the hedging item that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings. For consolidation purposes, the United Statesoperations are translated into
Canadian dollars using the current period-end rate with the resulting translation adjustment recorded in other comprehensive income. For reporting purposes, the consolidated operations are translated into United States dollars using the current rate
method. Under this method, all assets and liabilities are translated at the period-end rate of exchange and all revenue and expense items are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded
as a separate component of shareholders equity. In respect of other transactions denominated in currencies other than
the Canadian dollar, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Company are translated at the year-end rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the transaction dates. All of the exchange gains or losses resulting
from these other transactions are recognized in income.  e
Revenue recognition: The
Companys LTL segment and freight brokerage business unit recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment costs as incurred. For the LTL segment, revenue for transportation services not completed at the end of a
reporting period is recognized based on relative transit time in each period with expenses recognized as incurred. Revenue for the SCO operation is recognized as the management services are provided. 
Within the LTL business unit, revenue adjustments are estimated at the end of each quarterly reporting period. These adjustments result
from several factors, including weight and freight classification verifications, shipper bill of lading errors, pricing discounts and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments. The revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction in revenue from
operations and accrued for as part of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a contra-account to accounts receivable.

Significant accounting policies continued: 
Historical experience, trends and current information are used to update and evaluate
the estimate. As at December31, 2011, revenue adjustments as a percentage of revenue were not material.  f
Accounts receivable: Accounts
receivable are presented, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $29 million at December31, 2011 2010 $27 million.  g
Cash and cash equivalents: Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on account and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less and are stated at cost, which approximates market value. h
Inventory: Inventory consists
of tires and spare parts and is valued at the lower of average cost and replacement cost.  i
Property and equipment: 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis from the date
assets are put in service over their estimated useful lives as follows:  Buildings
30-315years
Leasehold interests and improvements
Overtermoflease
Vehicles Trailers and containers
12 years
Trucks
8 years
Machinery and equipment
5 - 10 years
Tires purchased as part of a vehicle are capitalized as a cost to the vehicle. Replacement tires are
expensed when placed in service.  j
Assets held for sale: The
Company has certain assets that are classified as assets held for sale. These assets are carried on the balance sheet at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value, less cost to sell. Once an asset is classified as held for sale, there
is no further depreciation taken on the asset. At December31, 2011, the net book value of assets held for sale was approximately $35 million. This amount is included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company
recorded charges of $15 million for the year ended December31, 2011 to reduce properties held for sale to estimate fair value, less cost to sell. These charges are included in loss gain on sale of property and equipment in the accompanying
statements of consolidated income loss.

Significant accounting policies continued:  k
Goodwill and intangible assets: 
FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 350 requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for
impairment on an annual basis and, more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist, using fair value measurement techniques. The fair value based test involves assumptions regarding long-term future performance of the reporting units, fair value
of the assets and liabilities, cost of capital rates, capital re-investment and other assumptions. Actual recovery of goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on the market conditions and other factors. In the event goodwill is determined
to be impaired, a charge to earnings would be required. As at September30, 2011, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment. 
At December31, 2011, the Company has not identified any indicators that would require re-testing for impairment. 
Intangible assets consist of not-to-compete covenants and customer relationships and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
expected lives ranging from threeto eight years. During 2011 and 2010, the Company has not identified any indicators that would require testing for an impairment. FASB ASC 820-10-05 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurement. The determined fair value of reporting units is a Level 3 measurement. l
Income taxes: The Company uses
the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Significant judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the year that includes the date of enactment. FASB ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, requires that uncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process, whereby ithe Company determines whether it is more
likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and iifor those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company would recognize the largest amount of
tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.  m
Share-based compensation: Under
the Companys stock option plan, options to purchase common shares of the Company may be granted to key employees, officers and directors of the Company by the Board of Directors or by the Companys Compensation Committee. There are
841,900 options outstanding under the plan. The term of each option is 10years and the vesting period is five years. The exercise price for options is the trading price of the common shares of the Company on The Toronto Stock Exchange on the
day of the grant. Note 10b provides supplemental disclosure for the Companys stock options.

Advertising costs: Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $408 in 2011 2010 - $324; 2009 - $376.  o
Impairment of long-lived assets: 
An impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows
expected from its use and disposal, and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value. A long-lived asset should be tested when events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be
recoverable. During 2011 and 2010, the Company has not identified any indicators that would require testing for an impairment.  p
Derivative instruments: 
Derivative instruments are used to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates. All derivatives are recognized on the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices and are recorded in either current or non-current assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in income or other
comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to income in the
period the hedged item affects income.If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified into income at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in income in
the current year. The Company formally documents all significant relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items,
as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or anticipated
transactions. The Company assesses all hedging relationships to determine whether the criteria for hedge accounting are met. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must be appropriately documented at inception of the hedge and
there must be reasonable assurance, both at the inception and throughout the term of the hedge, that the hedging relationship will be effective. Effectiveness requires a high degree of correlation of changes in fair values or cash flows between the
hedged item and the hedging instrument. Effectiveness is assessed on an ongoing basis through the term of the hedge in order to determine if hedge accounting remains appropriate. q
Claims and insurance accruals: 
Claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated total cost of claims, including amounts for claims incurred but not reported, for
cargo loss and damage, bodily injury and property damage, workers compensation, long-term disability and group health. In Canada and the United States, the Company has self-insurance retention amounts per incident for auto liability, casualty
and cargo claims. In the United States, the Company has self-insurance retention amounts per incident for workers compensation and employee medical. In establishing these accruals, management evaluates and monitors each claim individually, and
uses factors, such as historical experience, known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability.

Deferred share units: The
Company maintains a deferred share unit DSU plan for all directors. Under this plan, all directors receive units at the end of each quarter based on the market price of common shares equivalent to Cdn. $2,50000. The Company records
compensation expense and the corresponding liability each period initially for Cdn. $2,50000 and subsequently based on changes in the market price of common shares. In addition to the directors DSU plan, the Company adopted a DSU plan for senior executives. Under this plan, eligible senior executives receive units at the end of each quarter based on the market
price of common shares equivalent to the senior executives entitlement. The entitlement amount varies based on the senior executives position in the Company and the years of eligible service. The maximum entitlement amount varies between
$2,50000 and $20,00000 per annum. The Company records compensation expense and the corresponding liability each period based on the market price of common shares.  t
Use of estimates: The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Significant estimates are used in determining, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred tax assets, claims and insurance
accruals, share-based compensation, fair value measurements, intangible asset values and the fair value of reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment tests. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Acquisition: 
On February19, 2011, the Company acquired selected assets of Milan Express Inc.s Milan LTL
business, a private carrier headquartered in Milan, Tennessee for $76 million. Milan added new coverage to Vitrans network in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina. The total purchase price was
allocated to the fair value of tractor, trailer and other capital assets acquired. A majority of the tractors and trailers were financed by Milan with third parties. As part of the purchase, Vitran identified a third party finance company who agreed
to consolidate Milans financing and provide the Company a $60 million operating lease. The ownership of the assets resides with the finance company and these assets are being leased to Vitran in the form of an operating lease.

Acquisition continued: 
The lease meets the criteria of an operating lease pursuant to United States GAAP. The
remaining $17million of the purchase price was financed by the Companys revolving credit facility of which $01 million of cash consideration was due in six months from the closing date contingent on Vitran continuing to operate in
three out of the five aforementioned states that were added to the Companys existing network. During the third quarter of 2011, the condition for payment was met and therefore the Company paid the additional consideration due. The results of
operations of Milan are included as part of the LTL segment in the consolidated results of the Company commencing on February19, 2011.  4.

Risk management activities: 
The Company is exposed to market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. Interest rate swaps: The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with
regard to existing variable rate debt. The Company had entered into variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps on variable rate term debt and revolving debt to limit its exposure to changing interest rates and future cash flows for interest. The interest
rate swaps provided for the Company to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in return an amount equal to a variable rate of interest times the same notional amount. The swaps were
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portions of

Risk management activities continued: 
changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and were recognized into income in the same year in which the hedged forecasted
transaction affects income. Ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized into income as they occur. At December31, 2011, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. 
Effective January1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820-10, which provides a framework for measuring fair value under United
States GAAP. As defined in FASB ASC 820-10, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price.The Company
utilizes market data or assumptions that the Company believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.These inputs can be
readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company primarily applies the income approach for
recurring fair value measurements and endeavours to utilize the best available information. Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.The
Company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820-10-05 establishes a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs Level 3 measurement. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the
following as of December31:  00000 00000 00000 00000 2011

Hedges of net investment in self-sustaining operations: 
United States dollar denominated debt of $05 million held by an entity with a Canadian dollar functional currency is designated as a
hedge against the Companys exposure for a portion of its net investment in self-sustaining U.S. dollar denominated subsidiaries with a view to reducing the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. The foreign exchange effect of both the U.S.
dollar debt and the net investment in U.S. dollar denominated subsidiaries is reported in other comprehensive income. As at December31, 2011, the Companys net investment in U.S. dollar denominated subsidiaries totalled $2405 million
2010- $2689 million. No ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings as the notional amounts of the hedging item equals the portion of the net investment balance being hedged.
