To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Performance Technologies, Incorporated
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Performance Technologies, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000
and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE A - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
THE COMPANY: Performance Technologies, Incorporated the Company was formed in
1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware and maintains its corporate offices
in Rochester, New York. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets
telecommunications and networking products that enable the convergence of
wireline, wireless and next-generation Internet Protocol networks.
SEGMENT DATA, GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS: The Company
operates in one industry segment. Export sales to customers outside North
America represent 30%, 16% and 21% of sales for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. For 2000, 1999 and 1998, four customers
accounted for approximately 32%, 43% and 31%, respectively, of sales, with no
single customer representing greater than 12%, 23% and 11%, respectively, of
sales.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Effective December
10, 1999, the Company merged with MicroLegend Telecom Systems, Inc.
MicroLegend, which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and
accordingly all prior period consolidated financial statements have been
restated to include the combined results Note B. All inter-company
transactions have been eliminated.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Canadian currency is the functional currency of
the Company Canadian subsidiary. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations
are translated to U.S. dollars at current rates of exchange, and revenue and
expenses are translated using average rates. Gains and losses from foreign
currency translation are included as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Translation adjustments are not tax-effected as they relate to
investments considered permanent in nature. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year-end and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK: Financial instruments, which potentially expose
the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of
bank deposits, marketable securities and accounts receivable. Marketable
securities consist of high quality short-term interest bearing financial
instruments. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and the Company maintains an allowance for uncollectible
accounts receivable based upon the expected collectibility of all accounts
receivable.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The carrying amount of the Company
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximates their fair value at December 31, 2000, as the maturity of these
instruments are generally short term.
CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 27

CONTINUED
MARKETABLE SECURITIES: The Company has classified all of its marketable debt
securities as held to maturity and has accounted for these investments at
amortized cost. Accordingly, no adjustment for unrealized holding gains or
losses has been reflected in the financial statements. Marketable securities
classified as held to maturity are high credit quality securities in accordance
with the investment policy.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the
first-in, first-out method. The Company provides inventory reserves for excess,
obsolete or slow moving inventory based on changes in customer demand,
technology developments or other economic factors.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company adopted the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB
No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, for 2000. In doing so,
the Company did not incur any adjustments to revenue. Revenue is recognized upon
product shipment. Revenue from arrangements for software systems requiring
significant production, modification, or customization of software is recognized
over the contract period as performance milestones are fulfilled. Revenue from
consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are
rendered. Any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon
as such losses are determined. Revenue from software maintenance contracts is
recognized ratably over the contractual period, or as the service is performed.
EQUIPMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS: Equipment and improvements are recorded at cost
reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for using the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives                        
Engineering equipment and software      3-5 years
Manufacturing equipment           3-5 years
Furniture and equipment           3-5 years
Leasehold improvements            the lesser of 10 years or the lease term Upon retirement or disposal of an asset, the asset and the related accumulated
depreciation are eliminated from the accounts with gains or losses included as a
component of Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS: The Company regularly assesses all of its long-lived assets
for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may
not be recoverable, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.
During 1998, the Company recorded a charge for the remaining amount of
unamortized goodwill as its value had significantly decreased. Amortization
expense for goodwill was $123,000 for 1998.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred.
ADVERTISING: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in Selling
and marketing in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising expense
amounted to $244,000, $254,000 and $306,000 for 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS: Software development costs incurred subsequent to
the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to general release of
the product are capitalized and amortized on a product-by-product basis over
their estimated remaining economic life, generally three years, or using the
ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such
software, whichever provides greater amortization. 28
31 NOTE A - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED
INCOME TAXES: The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and
liability approach which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities. This
method utilizes enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the
temporary differences are expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to
changes in income tax rates upon enactment. Deferred tax assets are recognized,
net of any valuation allowance, for deductible temporary differences and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense benefit represents the
change in net deferred tax asset and liability balances.
EARNINGS PER SHARE: Earnings per share is presented in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing net income available by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share
calculations reflect the assumed exercise and conversion of employee stock
options and warrants.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Compensation costs are recognized in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, based on the difference, if any, between the quoted market price
of the stock on the grant date and the exercise date. In early 1999, a
compensation charge of $715,000 was recorded to operating expenses for the
issuance of stock options granted to MicroLegend employees with an exercise
price below the fair market value of its common stock.
NOTE B - BUSINESS COMBINATION

NOTE I - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
On February 9, 2000, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized common shares,
from 15 million shares to 50 million shares.
In August 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one
million shares of the Company Common Stock. During 2000, the Company
repurchased a total of 658,200 shares at a total cost of $8,825,000.
Pursuant to a stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in

terminated the stock repurchase program. In connection with the business
combination with MicroLegend Telecom Systems, Inc., the Company retired 185,174
shares of Treasury stock, at an average cost of $1206 per share for a total

The Company declared a three-for-two stock split of its common stock effected in
the form of 50% stock dividend on the outstanding shares payable to shareholders
of record as of August 26, 1999, with a distribution date of September 1, 1999.
Basic and diluted earnings per share, weighted average number of shares
outstanding and all applicable footnotes have been adjusted to reflect the
aforementioned stock split. All agreements concerning stock options and other

NOTE J - STOCK OPTION PLAN
In 1986, the Company established an Incentive Stock Option Plan pursuant to
which the Board of Directors reserved 2,700,000 shares of common stock for
grant. On February 9, 2000, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Stock
Option Plan to increase, by 500,000 shares, the number of authorized shares that
may be issued pursuant to this Plan. Options may be granted to any officer or 31
34 employee at not less than the fair market value at the date of grant not less
than 110% of the fair market value in the case of holders of more than 10% of
the Company common stock. Options granted under the plan generally expire
five or six years from the date of grant and generally vest over three, four or
five years.
With respect to non-qualified options, the Company recognizes a tax benefit upon
exercise in an amount equal to the tax effect of the difference between the
option price and the fair market value of the common stock. Tax benefits related
to such non-qualified stock options are credited to additional paid-in capital.
The following table summarizes stock option activity under this plan                                     Weighted-Average      Option

Outstanding at December 31, 2000           1,500,531        $1091       $444-$2875
At December 31, 2000, 677,951 options were vested and 735,695 options were
available for future grant under the stock option plan. During 2000, warrants
totaling 56,250, issued at fair market value in 1995, were exercised at an
exercise price of $122 per share. At December 31, 2000, 56,250 warrants were
held by one of the Company directors at an exercise price of $122 per share.
The remaining warrants were exercised in January 2001.
The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for the stock option plan. Had compensation cost for the stock
option plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards
in 2000, 1999 and 1998 consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the
Company net income would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts of
$4,570,000, $4,765,000 and $4,881,000, respectively. Basic earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts of $35, $36 and $37,
respectively. Diluted earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts of $33, $34 and $36, respectively. The assumption regarding the
stock options issued in 2000, 1999 and 1998 was that 33% of such options vested
annually. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 2000, 1999 and 1998: Dividend yield of 0 expected volatility of 63%, 65% and 62%; risk-free interest rate of 62%, 54%
and 55%; and expected lives of three years in 2000 and 1999 and five years in
1998, respectively. 32
35 NOTE K - STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
On October 27, 2000, the Company Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan. Under this plan, one Preferred Stock Purchase Right was distributed
as a dividend for each share of Common Stock held by the stockholders of record
as of the close of business of November 8, 2000. Until the occurrence of certain
events, the Rights are traded as a unit with the Common Stock. Each Right will
separate and entitle stockholders to buy stock upon the occurrence of certain
events generally related to the change of control of the Company as defined in
the Plan. The Rights become exercisable ten days after either 1 an Acquiring
Person acquires or commences a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of the
Company Common Stock, or 2 an Adverse Person has acquired 10% or more of
the Company Common Stock and the Board determines this person is likely to
cause pressure on the Company to enter into a transaction that is not in the
Company best long-term interest. All Rights not held by an Acquiring Person or
an Adverse Person become rights to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth
of one share of Preferred Stock at an initial exercise price of $110 per Right.
Each Right entitles the holder of that Right to purchase the equivalent of $220
worth of the Company Common Stock for $110. If after such an event the Company
merges, consolidates or engages in a similar transaction in which it does not
survive, each holder has a flip over right to buy discounted stock in the
surviving entity.
The Company may redeem the Rights for $001 each. The Rights Plan expires on
November 1, 2010 or can be modified or terminated, at the option of the Board of
Directors.

As of December 31, 2000, no deferred taxes have been provided on the
undistributed earnings of its Canadian subsidiary, as the Company does not plan
to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on
these undistributed earnings.

37 NOTE O - LITIGATION
Following the Company announcement on May 19, 2000 regarding its preliminary
results of operations for the second quarter and the year ended December 31,
2000, several class action lawsuits were filed against the Corporation, as well
as several of its officers and directors, alleging violations of federal
securities laws. The lawsuits were filed in United States District Court for the
Western District of New York and request unspecified monetary damages. The Lead
Counsel has been approved by the Court and an Amended Complaint, dated March 19,
2001, has been filed with the Court.
Management believes that the claims contained in these actions described above
are without merit and the Company intends to defend against the claims
vigorously. In the opinion of management, resolution of this litigation is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the
Company. However, depending on the amount and timing of such resolution, an
unfavorable resolution of this matter could materially affect the Company
future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.
The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise
in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of
any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect
the financial position of the Company.
