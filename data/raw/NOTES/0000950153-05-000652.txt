Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We have evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2004.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have each
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that we record,
process, summarize, and report information required to be disclosed by us in our quarterly reports
filed under the Securities Exchange Act within the time periods specified by the Securities and
Exchange Commissions rules and forms. During the quarterly period covered by this report, there
have not been any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. Subsequent to the date of their evaluation, there have not been any significant changes in our
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls, including any
corrective action with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
